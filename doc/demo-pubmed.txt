AB  - Manipulating the rhizosphere microbiome to enhance plant stress tolerance is an 
      environmentally friendly technology and a renewable resource to restore degraded 
      environments. Here we suggest a sustainable bioremediation strategy on the 
      example of Stebnyk mine tailings storage. We consider Salicornia europaea 
      rhizosphere community, and the ability of the phytoremediation plant Salix 
      viminalis to recruit its beneficial microbiome to mediate the pollution stress at 
      the Stebnyk mine tailings storage. The tailings contain large amounts of brine 
      salts and heavy metals that contaminate the ground water and surrounding areas, 
      changing soil biogeochemistry and causing increased erosion. The species richness 
      of the endophytic bacterial community of S. viminalis roots was assessed based on 
      observed OTUs, Shannon-InvSimpson, and evenness index. Our results obtained using 
      the plant-based enrichment strategy show that biodiversity was decreased across 
      the contamination zones and that S. europaea supplementation significantly 
      increased the species richness. Our results also indicate that the number of 
      dominating bacteria was not changed across zones in both S. europaea-treated and 
      untreated bacterial populations, and that the decrease in richness was mainly 
      caused by the low abundant bacterial OTUs. The importance of selecting the 
      bioremediation strains that are likely to harbor a reservoir of genetic traits 
      that aid in bioremediation function from the target environment is discussed.

TI  - Plant-Growth-Promoting Rhizobacteria Improve Seeds Germination and Growth of 
      Argania spinosa.
LID - 10.3390/plants13152025 [doi]
LID - 2025
AB  - Argania spinosa is among the most important species of the Moroccan forest in 
      terms of ecological, environmental, and socio-economic aspects. However, it faces 
      a delicate balance between regeneration and degradation in its natural habitat. 
      Hence, the efforts to preserve and regenerate argan forests are crucial for 
      biodiversity, soil quality, and local livelihoods, yet they face challenges like 
      overgrazing and climate change. Sustainable management practices, including 
      reforestation and community engagement, are vital for mitigating degradation. 
      Similarly, exploiting the argan tree's rhizosphere can enhance soil quality by 
      leveraging its rich microbial diversity. This approach not only improves crop 
      growth but also maintains ecosystem balance, ultimately benefiting both 
      agriculture and the environment. This enrichment can be achieved by different 
      factors: mycorrhizae, plant extracts, algae extracts, and plant growth-promoting 
      rhizobacteria (PGPR). The benefits provided by PGPR may include increased 
      nutrient availability, phytohormone production, shoot, root development, 
      protection against several plant pathogens, and disease reduction. In this study, 
      the effect of rhizobacteria isolated from the Agran rhizosphere was evaluated on 
      germination percentage and radicle length for Argania spinosa in vitro tests, 
      growth, collar diameter, and branching number under greenhouse conditions. One 
      hundred and twenty (120) bacteria were isolated from the argan rhizosphere and 
      evaluated for their capacity for phosphate solubilization and indole acetic acid 
      production. The results showed that 52 isolates could solubilize phosphorus, with 
      the diameters of the solubilization halos varying from 0.56 +/- 0.14 to 2.9 +/- 0.08 
      cm. Among 52 isolates, 25 were found to be positive for indole acetic acid 
      production. These 25 isolates were first tested on maize growth to select the 
      most performant ones. The results showed that 14 isolates from 25 tested 
      stimulated maize growth significantly, and 3 of them by 28% (CN005, CN006, and 
      CN009) compared to the control. Eight isolates (CN005, CN006, CN004, CN007, 
      CN008, CN009, CN010, and CN011) that showed plant growth of more than 19% were 
      selected to evaluate their effect on argan germination rate and radicle length 
      and were subjected to DNA extraction and conventional Sanger sequencing. The 8 
      selected isolates were identified as: Brevundimonas naejangsanensis sp2, 
      Alcaligenes faecalis, Brevundimonas naejangsanensis sp3, Brevundimonas 
      naejangsanensis sp4, Leucobacter aridicollis sp1, Leucobacter aridicollis sp2, 
      Brevundimonas naejangsanensis sp1, and Staphylococcus saprophyticus. The results 
      showed that Leucobacter aridicollis sp2 significantly increased the germination 
      rate by 95.83%, and the radicle length with a value of 2.71 cm compared to the 
      control (1.60 cm), followed by Brevundimonas naejangsanensis sp3 and Leucobacter 
      aridicollis sp1 (2.42 cm and 2.11 cm, respectively). Under greenhouse conditions, 
      the results showed that the height growth increased significantly for Leucobacter 
      aridicollis sp1 (42.07%) and Leucobacter aridicollis sp2 (39.99%). The isolates 
      Brevundimonas naejangsanensis sp3 and Leucobacter aridicollis sp1 increased the 
      gain of collar diameter by 41.56 and 41.21%, respectively, followed by 
      Leucobacter aridicollis sp2 and Staphyloccocus saprophyticus (38.68 and 22.79%). 
      Leucobacter aridicollis sp1 increased the ramification number per plant to 12 
      compared to the control, which had 6 ramifications per plant. The use of these 
      isolates represents a viable alternative in sustainable agriculture by improving 
      the germination rate and root development of the argan tree, as well as its 
      development, while increasing the availability of nutrients in the soil and 
      consequently improving fertilization.

AB  - Plant microbiota are an important factor impacting plant cadmium (Cd) uptake. 
      However, little is known about how plant microbiota affects the Cd uptake by 
      plants under the influence of microplastics (MPs) with different particle sizes. 
      In this study, bacterial structure and assembly in the rhizosphere and endosphere 
      in pakchoi were analyzed by amplicon sequencing of 16S rRNA genes under the 
      influence of different particle sizes of polystyrene microplastics (PS-MPs) 
      combined with Cd treatments. Results showed that there were no significant 
      differences observed in the shoot endophytes among different treatments. However, 
      compared to Cd treatment, larger-sized PS-MPs (2 and 20 mum) significantly 
      increased community diversity and altered the structural composition of 
      rhizosphere bacteria and root endophytes, while smaller-sized PS-MPs (0.2 mum) did 
      not. Under the treatment of larger-sized PS-MPs, the niche breadth of rhizosphere 
      bacteria and root endophytes were significantly increased. And larger-sized 
      PS-MPs also maintained stability and complexity of bacterial co-occurrence 
      networks, while smaller-sized PS-MPs reduced them. Furthermore, compared to Cd 
      treatment, the addition of larger particle size PS-MPs decreased the proportion 
      of homogeneous section, while increased the proportion of drift in root 
      endophytic bacterial community assembly. The role of larger-sized MPs in the 
      community assembly of rhizosphere bacteria was opposite. Using random forest and 
      structural equation models, the study found that larger-sized PS-MPs can promote 
      the colonization of specific bacterial taxa, such as Brevundimonas, AKAU4049, 
      SWB02, Ellin6055, Porphyrobacter, Sphingorhabdus, Rhodobacter, Erythrobacter, 
      Devosia and some other bacteria belonging to Alphaproteobacteria, in the 
      rhizosphere and root endosphere. The colonization of these taxa can may induce 
      the formation of biofilms in the roots, immobilize heavy metals through oxidation 
      processes, and promote plant growth, thereby reducing Cd uptake by pakchoi. The 
      findings of this study provide important insights into the microbial mechanisms 
      underlying the influence of MPs with different particle sizes on plant Cd uptake.

TI  - Mycorrhizal associations of temperate forest seedlings mediate rhizodeposition, 
      but not soil carbon storage, under elevated nitrogen availability.
PG  - e17446
LID - 10.1111/gcb.17446 [doi]
AB  - Tree-mycorrhizal associations are associated with patterns in nitrogen (N) 
      availability and soil organic matter storage; however, we still lack a 
      mechanistic understanding of what tree and fungal traits drive these patterns and 
      how they will respond to global changes in soil N availability. To address this 
      knowledge gap, we investigated how arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM)- and 
      ectomycorrhizal (EcM)-associated seedlings alter rhizodeposition in response to 
      increased seedling inorganic N acquisition. We grew four species each of EcM and 
      AM seedlings from forests of the eastern United States in a continuously 
      (13)C-labeled atmosphere within an environmentally controlled chamber and 
      subjected to three levels of (15)N-labeled fertilizer. We traced seedling (15)N 
      uptake from, and (13)C-labeled inputs (net rhizodeposition) into, root-excluded 
      or -included soil over a 5-month growing season. N uptake by seedlings was 
      positively related to rhizodeposition for EcM- but not AM-associated seedlings in 
      root-included soils. Despite this contrast in rhizodeposition, there was no 
      difference in soil C storage between mycorrhizal types over the course of the 
      experiment. Instead root-inclusive soils lost C, while root-exclusive soils 
      gained C. Our findings suggest that mycorrhizal associations mediate tree 
      belowground C investment in response to inorganic N availability, but these 
      differences do not affect C storage. Continued soil warming and N deposition 
      under global change will increase soil inorganic N availability and our seedling 
      results indicate this could lead to greater belowground C investment by 
      EcM-associated trees. This potential for less efficient N uptake by EcM-trees 
      could contribute to AM-tree success and a shift toward more AM-dominated 
      temperate forests.

AB  - The colonization of alien plants in new habitats is typically facilitated by 
      microorganisms present in the soil environment. However, the diversity and 
      structure of the archaeal, bacterial, and fungal communities in the latitudinal 
      spread of alien plants remain unclear. In this study, the rhizosphere and bulk 
      soil of Chromolaena odorata were collected from five latitudes in Pu' er city, 
      Yunnan Province, followed by amplicon sequencing of the soil archaeal, bacterial, 
      and fungal communities. Alpha and beta diversity results revealed that the 
      richness indices and the structures of the archaeal, bacterial, and fungal 
      communities significantly differed along the latitudinal gradient. Additionally, 
      significant differences were observed in the bacterial Shannon index, as well as 
      in the structures of the bacterial and fungal communities between the rhizosphere 
      and bulk soils. Due to the small spatial scale, trends of latitudinal variation 
      in the archaeal, bacterial, and fungal communities were not pronounced. Total 
      potassium, total phosphorus, available nitrogen, available potassium and total 
      nitrogen were the important driving factors affecting the soil microbial 
      community structure. Compared with those in bulk soil, co-occurrence networks in 
      rhizosphere microbial networks presented lower complexity but greater modularity 
      and positive connections. Among the main functional fungi, arbuscular mycorrhizae 
      and soil saprotrophs were more abundant in the bulk soil. The significant 
      differences in the soil microbes between rhizosphere and bulk soils further 
      underscore the impact of C. odorata invasion on soil environments. The 
      significant differences in the soil microbiota along latitudinal gradients, along 
      with specific driving factors, demonstrate distinct nutrient preferences among 
      archaea, bacteria, and fungi and indicate complex microbial responses to soil 
      nutrient elements following the invasion of C. odorata.

AB  - Coffee, the second most traded commodity globally after petroleum and is the most 
      exported cash crop of Ethiopia. However, coffee cultivation faces challenges due 
      to fungal diseases, resulting in significant yield losses. The primary fungal 
      diseases affecting coffee production include coffee berry disease, wilt disease 
      (caused by Gibberella xylarioides), and coffee leaf rust. In this study, we aimed 
      to isolate potentially antagonistic actinomycetes from the root rhizosphere of 
      wild Coffea arabica plants in the Yayo coffee forest biosphere in southwestern 
      Ethiopia. Soil samples were collected from the rhizosphere, and actinomycetes 
      were selectively isolated and identified to the genus level by morphological, 
      physiological, and biochemical characterization. These pure isolates were 
      screened for their antagonistic activity against Gibberella xylarioides in vitro 
      using a dual culturing method. Promising isolates demonstrating strong inhibition 
      of fungal mycelial growth were further investigated through in vivo experiments 
      using coffee seedlings. A total of 82 rhizobacteria were isolated. These 
      isolates' inhibition of fungal mycelial growth varied from 0% to 83.3%. Among 
      them, four isolates MUA26, MUA13, MUA52, and MUA14 demonstrated the highest 
      percentage inhibition of fungal mycelial growth: 83.3%, 80%, 76.67%, and 73.3%, 
      respectively. Seedlings inoculated with MUA13, MUA14, and MUA26 during the 
      challenge inoculations (Rhizobacteria + Gibberella xylarioides) exhibited the 
      lowest disease incidence compared to the infected fungi (P < 0.05). Notably, the 
      seedlings inoculated with MUA26 demonstrated the highest disease control 
      efficiency, reaching 83% (P < 0.05). MUA26 was found to produce extracellular 
      enzymes, including chitinase, protease, and lipase, which acted as inhibitors. In 
      summary, this study highlights that MUA26, among the actinomycete isolates, 
      exhibited significant antagonistic activity against Gibberella xylarioides f.sp. 
      coffea. Its efficacy in controlling coffee wilt disease, both in vitro and in 
      vivo, positions it as a potential bioinoculant for managing coffee wilt disease.

AB  - Rhizosphere microbial community characteristics and ecosystem multifunctionality 
      (EMF), both affected by topographic factors, are closely correlated. However, 
      more targeted exploration is yet required to fully understand the variations of 
      rhizosphere microbial communities along topographic gradients in different soil 
      layers, as well as whether and how they regulate EMF under specific site 
      conditions. Here, we conducted relevant research on Juglans mandshurica forests 
      at six elevation gradients and two slope positions ranging from 310 to 750 m in 
      Tianjin Baxian Mountain. Results demonstrated that rhizosphere soil 
      physicochemical properties and enzyme activities of both layers (0-20 cm and 
      20-40 cm) varied significantly with elevation, while only at top layer did slope 
      position have significant impacts on most indicators. Bacterial richness and 
      diversity were higher in the top layer at slope bottom and middle-high elevation, 
      the difference in fungi was not as noticeable. Both topographic factors and soil 
      depth significantly impacted microbial community structure, with 
      Candidatus_Udaeobacter of bacteria, Mortierella, Sebacina, and Hygrocybe of fungi 
      mainly contributing to the dissimilarity between communities. EMF rose with 
      increasing elevation, bacteria were more critical drivers of this process than 
      fungi, and topographic factors could affect EMF by altering bacterial diversity 
      and dominant taxa abundance. For evaluating EMF, the aggregate structure of sub 
      layer and the carbon cycle-related indicators of top layer were of higher 
      importance. Our results revealed the depth-dependent characteristics of the 
      rhizosphere microbial community along topographic gradients in studied stands, as 
      well as the pivotal regulatory role of bacteria on EMF, while also highlighting 
      depth as an important variable for analyzing soil properties and EMF. This work 
      helps us better understand the response of individuals and communities of J. 
      mandshurica to changing environmental conditions, further providing a scientific 
      reference for the management and protection of secondary forests locally and in 
      North China.

AB  - Salinization is a global problem affecting agricultural productivity and 
      sustainability. The application of exogenous microbial fertilizer harbors great 
      potential for improving saline-alkali soil conditions and increasing land 
      productivity. Yet the responses to microbial fertilizer application rate in terms 
      of rhizosphere soil biochemical characteristics, soil microbial community, and 
      crop yield and their interrelationships and underlying mechanisms are still 
      unclear. Here, we studied changes to rhizosphere soil-related variables, soil 
      enzyme activity (catalase, sucrase, urease), microbial community diversity, and 
      sweet sorghum (Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench) yield under four fertilization 
      concentration levels (0, 0.12, 0.24, and 0.36 kg m(-2)) in a saline-alkali 
      ecosystem (Shandong, China). Our results showed that the best improvement effect 
      on soil when the microbial fertilizer was applied at a rate of 0.24 kg m(-2). 
      Compared with the control (sweet sorghum + no fertilizer), it significantly 
      increased soil organic carbon (21.50 %), available phosphorus (26.14 %), 
      available potassium (36.30 %), and soil urease (38.46 %), while significantly 
      reducing soil pH (2.21 %) and EC (12.04 %). Meanwhile, the yield of sweet sorghum 
      was increased by 24.19 %. This is mainly because microbial fertilizers enhanced 
      the diversity and the network complexity of bacterial and fungal communities, and 
      influenced catalase (CAT), urease (UE), and sucrase (SC), thereby facilitating 
      nutrient release in the soil, enhancing soil fertility, and indirectly 
      influencing sweet sorghum productivity. Among them, Gemmatimonadota and 
      Verrucomicrobiota may be the key microbial factors affecting sweet sorghum yield, 
      while available potassium, soil urease and available phosphorus are the main soil 
      factors. These findings provide valuable theoretical insights for preserving the 
      health of coastal saline-alkali soils and meeting the agricultural demand for 
      increased yield per unit of land area.

TI  - Collimonas rhizosphaerae sp. nov., a novel species isolated from the beech 
      rhizosphere.
LID - 10.1099/ijsem.0.006481 [doi]
AB  - Bacterial strain H4R21(T) was isolated from beech rhizosphere soil sampled in the 
      forest experimental site of Montiers (Meuse, France). It effectively weathers 
      minerals, hydrolyses chitin and produces quorum sensing signal molecules. The 
      strain is aerobic and Gram-stain-negative. Phylogenetic analysis based on its 16S 
      rRNA gene sequence indicated that strain H4R21(T) belongs to the genus Collimonas 
      with high sequence similarity to C. arenae Ter10(T) (99.38 %), C. fungivorans 
      Ter6(T)(98.97 %), C. pratensis Ter91(T) (98.76 %), C. humicola RLT1W51(T) 
      (98.46 %) and C. silvisoli RXD178 (T) (98.46 %), but less than 98 % similarity to 
      other strains of the genus Collimonas. The predominant quinone in H4R21(T) is 
      ubiquinone-8 (Q8). The major polar lipids are diphosphatidylglycerol, 
      phosphatidylethanolamine, diphosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylglycerol and lipid. 
      The major fatty acids identified were C(12 : 0), C(12:0) 3-OH, C(16  :  0) and 
      C(17:0 )cyclo. The digital DNA G+C content of the genomic DNA was 59.5 mol%. 
      Furthermore, the strain could be clearly distinguished from its closely related 
      type strains by a combination of phylogenomic and in silico DNA-DNA hybridization 
      results, and phenotypic characteristics. Therefore, strain H4R21(T) represents a 
      novel species within the genus Collimonas, for which the name Collimonas 
      rhizosphaerae sp. nov. is proposed, with strain H4R21(T) (=CFBP 9203(T)=DSM 
      117599(T)) as the type strain.

TI  - Effects of Water and Nitrogen on Growth, Rhizosphere Environment, and Microbial 
      Community of Sophora alopecuroides: Their Interrelationship.
LID - 10.3390/plants13141970 [doi]
LID - 1970
AB  - The effective management of water and nitrogen is crucial in the artificial 
      cultivation of medicinal plants. Sophora alopecuroides, a perennial herbaceous 
      plant in the Fabaceae family, is extensively used in medicine, with alkaloids as 
      its primary bioactive constituents. Nevertheless, there remains a significant 
      knowledge gap regarding how rhizospheric microbial communities respond to varying 
      water and nitrogen conditions and their intricate relationships with soil 
      environments and the growth of S. alopecuroides. In this study, two-year-old S. 
      alopecuroides were used in a two-factor, three-level water-nitrogen interaction 
      experiment. The irrigation levels included W1 (30-35% of maximum water holding 
      capacity), W2 (50-55%), and W3 (70-75%), while nitrogen levels comprised N1 (32 
      mg/kg), N2 (64 mg/kg), and N3 (128 mg/kg). The study assessed plant growth 
      indicators, total alkaloid content, and rhizospheric soil physicochemical 
      parameters of S. alopecuroides. High-throughput sequencing (16S rRNA and ITS) was 
      employed to analyze variations in rhizospheric microbial community composition 
      and structure. The results showed that Proteobacteria and Ascomycota are the 
      predominant bacterial and fungal phyla in the rhizosphere microbial community of 
      S. alopecuroides. The highest biomass and alkaloid accumulation of S. 
      alopecuroides were observed under the N1W3 treatment (50% nitrogen application 
      and 70-75% of maximum water holding capacity). Specifically, six bacterial 
      genus-level biomarkers (TRA3_20, MND1, env_OPS_17, SBR1031, Haliangium, 
      S0134_terrestrial_group) and six fungal genus-level biomarkers (Pseudeurotium, 
      Rhizophagus, Patinella, Pseudeurotium, Patinella, Rhizophagus) were identified 
      under the N1W3 treatment condition. In the partial least squares path modeling 
      (PLS-PM), water and nitrogen treatments demonstrated markedly positive direct 
      effects on soil physicochemical parameters (p < 0.01), while showing significant 
      negative direct impacts on alkaloid accumulation and plant growth indicators (p < 
      0.05). Soil physicochemical parameters, in turn, significantly negatively 
      affected the rhizosphere fungal community (p < 0.05). Additionally, the 
      rhizosphere fungal community exhibited highly significant negative direct effects 
      on both the plant growth indicators and total alkaloid content of S. 
      alopecuroides (p < 0.01). This study provides new insights into the interactions 
      among rhizosphere soil environment, rhizosphere microbiota, plant growth, and 
      alkaloid accumulation under water and nitrogen regulation, offering a scientific 
      basis for the water and nitrogen management in the cultivation of S. 
      alopecuroides.

TI  - Analysis of the Fungal Community Composition in Endemic Orchids with Terrestrial 
      Habitat in Subtropical Regions.
LID - 10.3390/microorganisms12071412 [doi]
LID - 1412
AB  - Habenaria and Liparis are well-known orchid genera that grow in terrestrial 
      habitats in the tropics, subtropics or temperate zones. Three species have been 
      found in subtropical regions of China, inhabiting terrestrial to epiphytic 
      habitats. This study focuses on three species, H. dentata (distributed in Asia), 
      H. yachangensis, and L. gigantea. For H. yachangensis and L. gigantea, there is 
      no information about the mycorrhizal community in these species. This study aims 
      to conduct the fungal community screening of Chinese ground orchids from 
      subtropical regions. We performed a comparative analysis of the fungal community 
      among H. dentata, H. yachangensis, and L. gigantea, determining their ITS regions 
      using NGS paired-end sequences. The results clarified the diversity and the 
      predominance of fungal genera. Ascomycota was abundant compared to Basidiomycota 
      or other fungi groups in all communities, with a high dominance in all 
      populations, especially for L. gigantea. At different root spatial locations, the 
      fungal community diversity and richness were higher in the soil than in the 
      rhizosphere or inner root. However, the results suggest that L. gigantea has a 
      different fungal community compared to Habenaria species. In this order, the 
      subtropical terrestrial orchids have a different fungal network compared to the 
      northern terrestrial orchids. Also, there is a high probability of co-existence 
      and co-evolution of endophytic fungi in these terrestrial orchids, indicating the 
      potential role of host plants in selecting an endophytic fungal community. 
      Furthermore, our results highlight the need to elucidate the microbe interactions 
      of these unique orchids for long-term purposes, such as isolating indigenous 
      fungi for suitable inoculants for further orchid propagation, restoration, and 
      conservation.

AB  - Among various factors related to the forest carbon pool, the tree stand age, 
      which interacts with soil organic matter, decomposition rates, and microbial 
      activity, is essential and cannot be disregarded. However, knowledge about how 
      tree phases influence soil carbon sinks is not adequate. This study sampled Larix 
      kaempferi (Japanese larch) plantations with different tree stand ages to 
      investigate the temporal dynamics of soil carbon sink in the forest. 
      Physiochemical analyses and high-throughput sequencing results further revealed 
      the interactions of tree stands and their related rhizosphere microbiome. It was 
      found that microbial composition and metabolic activity were significantly 
      affected by different tree ages, whose structures gradually diversified and 
      became more stable from young to mature forests. Many keystone taxa from the 
      phyla Chloroflexi, Proteobacteria, Acidobacteriota, and Nitrospirota were found 
      to be associated with carbon transformation processes. Interestingly, the carbon 
      resource utilization strategies of microbial groups related to tree ages also 
      differed, with near-mature forest soils showing better labile carbon degradation 
      capacity, and mature forests possessing higher degradation potential of 
      recalcitrant carbon. Age-altered tree growth and physiology were found to 
      interact with its rhizosphere microbiome, which is the driving factor in the 
      formation and stability of forest soil carbon. This study highlighted that the 
      tree age-associated soil microbiomes, which provided insights into their effects 
      on soil carbon transformation, were significant in enhancing the knowledge of 
      carbon sequestration in L. kaempferi plantations.

AB  - Root exudation and its mediated nutrient cycling process driven by nitrogen (N) 
      fertilizer can stimulate the plant availability of various soil nutrients, which 
      is essential for microbial nutrient acquisition. However, the response of soil 
      microbial resource limitations to long-term N fertilizer application rates in 
      greenhouse vegetable systems has rarely been investigated. Therefore, we selected 
      a 15-year greenhouse vegetable system, and investigated how N fertilizer 
      application amount impacts on root carbon and nitrogen exudation rates, microbial 
      resource limitations and microbial carbon use efficiency (CUE(ST)). Four N 
      treatments were determined: high (N3), medium (N2), low (N1), and a control 
      without N fertilization (N0). Compared to the control (N0), the results showed 
      that the root C exudation rates decreased significantly by 42.9 %, 57.3 % and 
      33.6 %, and the root N exudation rates decreased significantly by 29.7 %, 42.6 %, 
      and 24.1 % under N1, N2, and N3 treatments, respectively. Interactions between 
      fertilizer and plant roots altered microbial C, N, P limitations and CUE(ST); 
      Microbial C and N/P limitations were positively correlated with root C and N 
      exudation rates, negatively correlated with microbial CUE(ST). Random Forest 
      analysis revealed that the root C and N exudation rates were key factors for soil 
      microbial resource limitations and microbial CUE(ST). Through the structural 
      equation model (SEM) analysis, soil NH(4)(+) content had significant direct 
      effects on the root exudation rates after long-term N fertilizer application. An 
      increase in root exudation rates led to enhanced microbial resource limitations 
      in the rhizosphere soils, potentially due to increased competition. This 
      enhancement may reduce microbial carbon use efficiency (CUE), that is, microbial 
      C turnover, thereby reducing soil C sequestration. Overall, this study highlights 
      the critical role of root exudation rates in microbial resource limitations and 
      CUE changes in plant-soil systems, and further improves our understanding of 
      plant-microbial interactions.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Climate change and anthropogenic activities intensify salinity stress 
      impacting significantly on plant productivity and biodiversity in agroecosystems. 
      There are naturally salt-tolerant plants (halophytes) that can grow and withstand 
      such harsh conditions. Halophytes have evolved along with their associated 
      microbiota to adapt to hypersaline environments. Identifying shared microbial 
      taxa between halophyte species has rarely been investigated. We performed a 
      comprehensive meta-analysis using the published bacterial 16S rRNA gene sequence 
      datasets to untangle the rhizosphere microbiota structure of two halophyte groups 
      and non-halophytes. We aimed for the identification of marker taxa of plants 
      being adapted to a high salinity using three independent approaches. RESULTS: 
      Fifteen studies met the selection criteria for downstream analysis, consisting of 
      40 plants representing diverse halophyte and non-halophyte species. Microbiome 
      structural analysis revealed distinct compositions for halophytes that face high 
      salt concentrations in their rhizosphere compared to halophytes grown at low salt 
      concentrations or from non-halophytes. For halophytes grown at high salt 
      concentrations, we discovered three bacterial genera that were independently 
      detected through the analysis of the core microbiome, key hub taxa by network 
      analysis and random forest analysis. These genera were Thalassospira, 
      Erythrobacter, and Marinobacter. CONCLUSIONS: Our meta-analysis revealed that 
      salinity level is a critical factor in affecting the rhizosphere microbiome 
      assembly of plants. Detecting marker taxa across high-halophytes may help to 
      select Bacteria that might improve the salt tolerance of non-halophytic plants.

TI  - How the root bacterial community of Ficus tikoua responds to nematode infection: 
      enrichments of nitrogen-fixing and nematode-antagonistic bacteria in the 
      parasitized organs.

AB  - Plant-parasitic nematodes (PPNs) are among the most damaging pathogens to host 
      plants. Plants can modulate their associated bacteria to cope with nematode 
      infections. The tritrophic plant-nematode-microbe interactions are highly 
      taxa-dependent, resulting in the effectiveness of nematode agents being variable 
      among different host plants. Ficus tikoua is a versatile plant with high 
      application potential for fruits or medicines. In recent years, a few farmers 
      have attempted to cultivate this species in Sichuan, China, where parasitic 
      nematodes are present. We used 16S rRNA genes to explore the effects of nematode 
      parasitism on root-associated bacteria in this species. Our results revealed that 
      nematode infection had effects on both endophytic bacterial communities and 
      rhizosphere communities in F. tikoua roots, but on different levels. The species 
      richness increased in the rhizosphere bacterial communities of infected 
      individuals, but the community composition remained similar as compared with that 
      of healthy individuals. Nematode infection induces a deterministic assembly 
      process in the endophytic bacterial communities of parasitized organs. 
      Significant taxonomic and functional changes were observed in the endophytic 
      communities of root knots. These changes were characterized by the enrichment of 
      nitrogen-fixing bacteria, including Bradyrhizobium, 
      Allorhizobium-Neorhizobium-Pararhizobium-Rhizobium, and nematode-antagonistic 
      bacteria, such as Pseudonocardia, Pseudomonas, Steroidobacter, Rhizobacter, and 
      Ferrovibrio. Our results would help the understanding of the tritrophic 
      plant-nematode-bacterium interactions in host plants other than dominant crops 
      and vegetables and would provide essential information for successful nematode 
      management when F. tikoua were cultivated on large scales.

AB  - Fertilizer input is one of the effective forest management practices, which 
      improves soil nutrients and microbial community compositions and promotes forest 
      productivity. However, few studies have explored the response of rhizosphere soil 
      microbial communities to various fertilization regimes across seasonal dynamics. 
      Here, we collected the rhizosphere soil samples from Phoebe bournei plantations 
      to investigate the response of community assemblages and microbial interactions 
      of the soil microbiome to the short-term application of four typical fertilizer 
      practices (including chemical fertilizer (CF), organic fertilizer (OF), compound 
      microbial fertilizer (CMF), and no fertilizer control (CK)). The amendments of 
      organic fertilizer and compound microbial fertilizer altered the composition of 
      rhizosphere soil bacterial and fungal communities, respectively. The 
      fertilization regime significantly affected bacterial diversity rather than 
      fungal diversity, and rhizosphere fungi responded more sensitively than bacteria 
      to season. Fertilization-induced fungal networks were more complex than bacterial 
      networks. Stochastic processes governed both rhizosphere soil bacterial and 
      fungal communities, and drift and dispersal limitation dominated soil fungal and 
      bacterial communities, respectively. Collectively, these findings demonstrate 
      contrasting responses to community assemblages and interactions of rhizosphere 
      bacteria and fungi to fertilizer practices. The application of organic 
      fertilization strengthens microbial interactions and changes the succession of 
      key taxa in the rhizosphere habitat. KEY POINTS: * Fertilization altered the key 
      taxa and microbial interaction * Organic fertilizer facilitated the turnover of 
      rhizosphere microbial communities * Stochasticity governed soil fungal and 
      bacterial community assembly.

TI  - Antibacterial activity and biosynthetic potential of Streptomyces sp. PBR19, 
      isolated from forest rhizosphere soil of Assam.
LID - 10.1007/s42770-024-01454-3 [doi]
AB  - An Actinomycetia isolate, designated as PBR19, was derived from the rhizosphere 
      soil of Pobitora Wildlife Sanctuary (PWS), Assam, India. The isolate, identified 
      as Streptomyces sp., shares a sequence similarity of 93.96% with its nearest type 
      strain, Streptomyces atrovirens. This finding indicates the potential 
      classification of PBR19 as a new taxon within the Actinomycetota phylum. PBR19 
      displayed notable antibacterial action against some ESKAPE pathogens. The ethyl 
      acetate extract of PBR19 (EtAc-PBR19) showed the lowest minimum inhibitory 
      concentration (MIC) of >/= 0.195 microg/mL against Acinetobacter baumannii ATCC 
      BAA-1705. A lower MIC indicates higher potency against the tested pathogen. 
      Scanning electron microscope (SEM) findings revealed significant changes in the 
      cytoplasmic membrane structure of the pathogen. This suggests that the 
      antibacterial activity may be linked to the disruption of the microbial membrane. 
      The predominant chemical compound detected in the EtAc-PBR19 was identified as 
      phenol, 3,5-bis(1,1-dimethylethyl), comprising 48.59% of the area percentage. 
      Additionally, PBR19 was found to contain the type II polyketide synthases (PKS 
      type II) gene associated with antibiotic synthesis. The predicted gene product of 
      PKSII was identified as the macrolide antibiotic Megalomicin A. The taxonomic 
      distinctiveness, potent antibacterial effects, and the presence of a gene 
      associated with antibiotic synthesis suggest that PBR19 could be a valuable 
      candidate for further exploration in drug development and synthetic biology. The 
      study contributes to the broader understanding of microbial diversity and the 
      potential for discovering bioactive compounds in less-explored environments.

AB  - Mangrove ecosystems, characterized by high levels of productivity, are 
      susceptible to anthropogenic activities, notably oil pollution arising from 
      diverse origins including spills, transportation, and industrial effluents. Owing 
      to their role in climate regulation and economic significance, there is a growing 
      interest in developing mangrove conservation strategies. In the Arabian Gulf, 
      mangroves stand as the sole naturally occurring green vegetation due to the 
      region's hot and arid climate. However, they have faced persistent oil pollution 
      for decades. This review focuses on global mangrove distribution, with a specific 
      emphasis on Qatar's mangroves. It highlights the ongoing challenges faced by 
      mangroves, particularly in relation to the oil industry, and the impact of oil 
      pollution on these vital ecosystems. It outlines major oil spill incidents 
      worldwide and the diverse hydrocarbon-degrading bacterial communities within 
      polluted areas, elucidating their potential for bioremediation. The use of 
      symbiotic interactions between mangrove plants and bacteria offers a more 
      sustainable, cost-effective and environmentally friendly alternative. However, 
      the success of these bioremediation strategies depends on a deep understanding of 
      the dynamics of bacterial communities, environmental factors and specific nature 
      of the pollutants.

TI  - Development and evaluation of real-time quantitative PCR assays for detection of 
      Phellinus noxius causing brown root rot disease.
LID - 10.1094/PDIS-01-24-0238-RE [doi]
AB  - Brown root rot disease (BRRD) is a highly destructive tree disease. Early 
      diagnosis of BRRD has been challenging because the first symptoms and signs are 
      often observed after extensive tissue colonization. Existing molecular detection 
      methods, all based on the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region, were 
      developed without testing against global Phellinus noxius isolates, other wood 
      decay fungi, or host plant tissues. This study developed SYBR Green real-time 
      quantitative PCR (qPCR) assays for P. noxius. The primer pair Pn_ITS_F/Pn_ITS_R 
      targets the ITS, and the primer pair Pn_NLR_F/Pn_NLR_R targets a P. noxius-unique 
      group of homologous genes identified through a comparative genomics analysis. The 
      homologous genes belong to the nucleotide-binding-oligomerization-domain-like 
      receptor (NLR) superfamily. The new primer pairs and a previous primer pair 
      G1F/G1R were optimized for qPCR conditions and tested for specificity using 61 
      global P. noxius isolates, five other Phellinus species, and 22 non-Phellinus 
      wood decay fungal species. While all three primer pairs could detect as little as 
      100 fg (about 2.99 copies) of P. noxius genomic DNA, G1F/G1R had the highest 
      specificity and Pn_NLR_F/Pn_NLR_R had the highest efficiency. To avoid false 
      positives, the cutoff Cq values were determined as 34 for G1F/G1R, 29 for 
      Pn_ITS_F/Pn_ITS_R, and 32 for Pn_NLR_F/Pn_NLR_R. We further validated these qPCR 
      assays using Ficus benjamina seedlings artificially inoculated with P. noxius, 
      six tree species naturally infected by P. noxius, rhizosphere soil, and bulk 
      soil. The newly developed qPCR assays provide sensitive detection and 
      quantification of P. noxius, which is useful for long-term monitoring of BRRD 
      status.

      Alder Decline in Bulgaria.
LID - 10.3390/life14060720 [doi]
LID - 720
AB  - A number of Phytophthora species have been identified as destructive plant 
      pathogens and invasive species. They have the potential to affect a wide range of 
      host plants and cause diseases in agricultural and forest ecosystems. Two 
      Phytophthora species from rhizosphere soil samples collected from declining Alnus 
      glutinosa in Bulgaria were isolated in the autumn of 2022. They were identified 
      as Phytophthora polonica and Phytophthora hydropathica according to the DNA 
      sequence analysis of the ITS region, as well as their morphological and 
      physiological characteristics. The pathogenicity of both species to common and 
      gray alder was evaluated by the inoculation of detached leaves and cuttings. 
      Experimental data proved that P. polonica and P. hydropathica are able to cause 
      leaf necrosis not only on A. glutinosa from which they were derived, but also on 
      A. incana. No significant deference in the aggressiveness of the studied isolates 
      from both Phytophthora species against the two tested plants was observed. 
      Therefore, P. polonica and P. hydropathica were determined as potential threats 
      for alder ecosystems in the country. This is the first report for the isolation 
      of P. polonica in Bulgaria and represents the most southeastern point of the 
      species distribution in Europe.

TI  - Altitudinal Impact on Phytochemical Composition and Mycorrhizal Diversity of 
      Taxus Contorta Griff in the Temperate Forest of Shimla District.
PG  - e2400016
LID - 10.1002/jobm.202400016 [doi]
AB  - Taxus contorta (family Taxaceae) is a native plant of temperate region of western 
      Himalaya. The current study investigated the effect of altitude on the 
      phytochemical composition and mycorrhizal diversity, associated with distribution 
      of T. contorta in Shimla district, Himachal Pradesh, India. Quantitative 
      phytochemical analysis of the leaf extracts indicated that alkaloid levels 
      decreased with altitude, with the highest value in Himri's methanol extracts 
      (72.79 +/- 1.08 mg/g) while phenol content increased with altitude, peaking in 
      Nankhari's methanol extracts (118.83 +/- 5.90 mg/g). Saponin content was higher in 
      methanol extracts (78.13 +/- 1.66 mg/g in Nankhari, 68.06 +/- 1.92 mg/g in Pabbas, 
      and 56.32 +/- 1.93 mg/g in Himri). Flavonoid levels were notably higher in 
      chloroform extracts, particularly in Nankhari (219.97 +/- 2.99 mg/g), and 
      positively correlated with altitude. Terpenoids were higher in chloroform 
      extracts at Himri (11.34 +/- 0.10 mg/g) and decreased with altitude. Taxol content 
      showed minimal variation between solvents and altitudes (4.53-6.98 ppm), while 
      rutin was only detected in methanol extracts (1.31-1.46 ppm). Mycorrhizal spore 
      counts in T. contorta's rhizosphere varied with altitude: highest at Himri 
      (77.83 +/- 2.20 spores/50 g soil), decreasing to Pabbas (68.06 +/- 1.96 spores/50 g 
      soil) and lowest at Nankhari (66.00 +/- 2.77 spores/50 g soil), with 17 AMF species 
      identified overall, showing significant altitudinal influence on spore density. 
      The rhizosphere of T. contorta was shown to be dominated by the Glomus species. 
      The rhizospheric soil of the plant was found to be slightly acidic. Organic 
      carbon and available potassium content decreased contrasting with increasing 
      available nitrogen and phosphorus with altitude. Correlation data showed strong 
      negative links between organic carbon (-0.83), moderate positive for nitrogen 
      (0.46) and phosphorus (0.414), and moderate negative for potassium (-0.56) with 
      the altitude. This study provides a comprehensive insight into changes in 
      phytochemical constituents, mycorrhizal diversity and soil composition of T. 
      contorta along a range of altitude.

TI  - Rhizobacterial Bacillus enrichment in soil enhances smoke tree resistance to 
      Verticillium wilt.
LID - 10.1111/pce.15004 [doi]
AB  - Verticillium wilt, caused by the soilborne fungus Verticillium dahliae, poses a 
      serious threat to the health of more than 200 plant species worldwide. Although 
      plant rhizosphere-associated microbiota can influence plant resistance to V. 
      dahliae, empirical evidence underlying Verticillium wilt resistance of perennial 
      trees is scarce. In this study, we systemically investigated the effect of the 
      soil microbiota on the resistance of smoke trees (Cotinus coggygria) to 
      Verticillium wilt using field, greenhouse and laboratory experiments. Comparative 
      analysis of the soil microbiota in the two stands of smoke trees suggested that 
      Bacillus represented the most abundant and key microbial genus related to 
      potential disease suppression. Smoke tree seedlings were inoculated with isolated 
      Bacillus strains, which exhibited disease suppressiveness and plant 
      growth-promoting properties. Furthermore, repletion of Bacillus agents to disease 
      conducive soil significantly resulted in reduced incidence of smoke tree wilt and 
      increased resistance of the soil microbiota to V. dahliae. Finally, we explored a 
      more effective combination of Bacillus agents with the fungicide propiconazole to 
      combat Verticillium wilt. The results establish a foundation for the development 
      of an effective control for this disease. Overall, this work provides a direct 
      link between Bacillus enrichment and disease resistance of smoke trees, 
      facilitating the development of green control strategies and measurements of 
      soil-borne diseases.

TI  - Improving Tree Seedling Quality Using Humates Combined with Bacteria to Address 
      Decarbonization Challenges through Forest Restoration.
LID - 10.3390/plants13111452 [doi]
LID - 1452
AB  - Improving the quality of tree planting material for carbon sequestration through 
      reforestation can help solve environmental problems, including the need to reduce 
      the concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. The purpose of this study 
      was to investigate the possibility of using humic substances in combination with 
      rhizosphere microorganisms Pseudomonas protegens DA1.2 and Pseudomonas sp. 4CH as 
      a means to stimulate the growth of seedlings of pine, poplar, large-leaved 
      linden, red oak, horse chestnut, and rowan. Humic substances stimulated the 
      growth of shoots and roots of pine, large-leaved linden, and horse chestnut 
      seedlings. The effects of bacteria depended on both plant and bacteria species: 
      Pseudomonas protegens DA1.2 showed a higher stimulatory effect than Pseudomonas 
      sp. 4CH on pine and linden, and Pseudomonas sp. 4CH was more effective in the 
      case of chestnut. An additive effect of humates and Pseudomonas protegens DA1.2 
      on the growth rate of pine and linden saplings was discovered. Poplar, red oak, 
      and rowan seedlings were unresponsive to the treatments. The growth-stimulating 
      effects of the treatments are discussed in connection with the changes in carbon, 
      chlorophyll, and nitrogen contents in plants. The results show the need for 
      further research in bacterial species capable of stimulating the growth of plant 
      species that were unresponsive in the present experiments.

AB  - Salt stress is a major abiotic stress that affects the growth of Reaumuria 
      soongorica and many psammophytes in the desert areas of Northwest China. However, 
      various Plant Growth-Promoting Rhizobacteria (PGPR) have been known to play an 
      important role in promoting plant growth and alleviating the damaging effects of 
      salt stress. In this study, three PGPR strains belonging to Bacillaceae were 
      isolated from the rhizosphere of Reaumuria soongorica by morphological and 
      molecular identification. All isolated strains exhibited capabilities of 
      producing IAA, solubilizing phosphate, and fixing nitrogen, and were able to 
      tolerate high levels of NaCl stress, up to 8-12%. The results of the pot-based 
      experiment showed that salt (400 mM NaCl) stress inhibited Reaumuria soongorica 
      seedlings' growth performance as well as biomass production, but after 
      inoculation with strains P2, S37, and S40, the plant's height significantly 
      increased by 26.87, 17.59, and 13.36%, respectively (p < 0.05), and both 
      aboveground and root fresh weight significantly increased by more than 2 times 
      compared to NaCl treatment. Additionally, inoculation with P2, S37, and S40 
      strains increased the content of photosynthetic pigments, proline, and soluble 
      protein in Reaumuria soongorica seedlings under NaCl stress, while reducing the 
      content of malondialdehyde and soluble sugars. Metabolomic analysis showed that 
      strain S40 induces Reaumuria soongorica seedling leaves metabolome reprogramming 
      to regulate cell metabolism, including plant hormone signal transduction and 
      phenylalanine, tyrosine, and tryptophan biosynthesis pathways. Under NaCl stress, 
      inoculation with strain S40 upregulated differential metabolites in plant hormone 
      signal transduction pathways including plant hormones such as auxins (IAA), 
      cytokinins, and jasmonic acid. The results indicate that inoculation with 
      Bacillaceae can promote the growth of Reaumuria soongorica seedlings under NaCl 
      stress and enhance salt tolerance by increasing the content of photosynthetic 
      pigments, accumulating osmoregulatory substances, regulating plant hormone levels 
      This study contributes to the enrichment of PGPR strains capable of promoting the 
      growth of desert plants and has significant implications for the psammophytes 
      growth and development in desert regions, as well as the effective utilization 
      and transformation of saline-alkali lands.

AB  - The combined cadmium (Cd) and acid rain pollution poses a significant threat to 
      the global ecological environment. Previous studies on the combined adverse 
      effects have predominantly focused on the aboveground plant physiological 
      responses, with limited reports on the microbial response in the rhizosphere 
      soil. This study employed Populus beijingensis seedlings and potting experiments 
      to simulate the impacts of combined mild acid rain (pH=4.5, MA) or highly strong 
      acid rain (pH=3.0, HA), and soil Cd pollution on the composition and diversity of 
      microbial communities, as well as the physiochemical properties in the 
      rhizosphere soil. The results showed that Cd decreased the content of inorganic 
      nitrogen, resulting in an overall decrease of 49.10 % and 46.67 % in ammonium 
      nitrogen and nitrate nitrogen, respectively. Conversely, acid rain was found to 
      elevate the content of total potassium and soil organic carbon by 4.68 %-6.18 % 
      and 8.64-19.16 %, respectively. Additionally, simulated acid rain was observed to 
      decrease the pH level by 0.29-0.35, while Cd increased the pH level by 0.11. 
      Moreover, Cd alone reduced the rhizosphere bacterial diversity, however, when 
      combined with acid rain, regardless of its intensity, Cd was observed to increase 
      the diversity. Fungal diversity was not influenced by the acid rain, but Cd 
      increased fungal diversity to some extend under HA as observed in bacterial 
      diversity. In addition, composition of the rhizosphere bacterial community was 
      primarily influenced by the inorganic nitrogen components, while the fungal 
      community was driven mainly by soil pH. Furthermore, "Metabolism" was emerged as 
      the most significant bacterial function, which was markedly affected by the 
      combined pollution, while Cd pollution led to a shift from symbiotroph to other 
      trophic types for fungi. These findings suggest that simulated acid rain has a 
      mitigating effect on the diversity of rhizosphere bacteria affected by Cd 
      pollution, and also alters the trophic type of these microorganisms. This can be 
      attributed to the acid rain-induced direct acidic environment, as well as the 
      indirect changes in the availability or sources of carbon, nitrogen, or 
      potassium.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Apple Replant Disease (ARD) is common in major apple-growing regions 
      worldwide, but the role of rhizosphere microbiota in conferring ARD resistance 
      and promoting plant growth remains unclear. RESULTS: In this study, a synthetic 
      microbial community (SynCom) was developed to enhance apple plant growth and 
      combat apple pathogens. Eight unique bacteria selected via microbial culture were 
      used to construct the antagonistic synthetic community, which was then inoculated 
      into apple seedlings in greenhouse experiments. Changes in the rhizomicroflora 
      and the growth of aboveground plants were monitored. The eight strains, belonging 
      to the genera Bacillus and Streptomyces, have the ability to antagonize pathogens 
      such as Fusarium oxysporum, Rhizoctonia solani, Botryosphaeria ribis, and 
      Physalospora piricola. Additionally, these eight strains can stably colonize in 
      apple rhizosphere and some of them can produce siderophores, ACC deaminase, and 
      IAA. Greenhouse experiments with Malus hupehensis Rehd indicated that SynCom 
      promotes plant growth (5.23%) and increases the nutrient content of the soil, 
      including soil organic matter (9.25%) and available K (1.99%), P (7.89%), and N 
      (0.19%), and increases bacterial richness and the relative abundance of 
      potentially beneficial bacteria. SynCom also increased the stability of the 
      rhizosphere microbial community, the assembly of which was dominated by 
      deterministic processes (|beta NTI| > 2). CONCLUSIONS: Our results provide insights 
      into the contribution of the microbiome to pathogen inhibition and host growth. 
      The formulation and manipulation of similar SynComs may be a beneficial strategy 
      for promoting plant growth and controlling soil-borne disease.

AB  - Soil fungi play a critical role in the biogeochemical cycles of forest 
      ecosystems. Larix gmelinii is a strong and important timber tree species, which 
      forms close associations with a wide range of soil fungi. However, the 
      temporal-spatial disparity effects on the assembly of soil fungal communities in 
      L. gmelinii forests are poorly understood. To address these questions, a total of 
      120 samples, including 60 bulk soil and 60 root samples, were collected from 
      Aershan and Genhe in July (summer) and October (autumn)2021. We obtained 7,788 
      operational taxonomic units (OTUs) after merging, filtering, and rarefying using 
      high-throughput sequencing. The dominant phyla are Basidiomycota, Ascomycota, 
      Mortierellomycota, and Mucoromycota. There were 13 dominant families, among which 
      the families with average relative abundance more than 5% included 
      Thelephoraceae, Mortierellaceae, Archaeorhizomycoaceae, and Inocybaceae. In the 
      functional guilds, symbiotrophic fungi had a relative advantage in the identified 
      functions, and the relative abundances of pathotrophic and saprotrophic fungi 
      varied significantly between sites. There were 12 families differentially 
      expressed across compartments, 10 families differentially expressed between 
      seasons, and 69 families were differentially expressed between sites. The 
      variation in alpha diversity in the bulk soil was greater than that in the 
      rhizosphere soil. Among the three parts (compartment, season, and site), the site 
      had a crucial effect on the beta diversity of the fungal community. Deterministic 
      processes dominated fungal community assembly in Genhe, whereas stochastic 
      processes dominated in Aershan. Soil physicochemical properties and climatic 
      factors significantly affected fungal community structure, among which soil total 
      nitrogen and pH had the greatest effect. This study highlights that spatial 
      variations play a vital role in the structure and assembly of soil fungal 
      communities in L. gmelinii forests, which is of great significance for us in 
      maintaining the health of the forests.

AB  - Trees contribute to bedrock weathering in a variety of ways. However, evaluating 
      their full impact is complicated by a lack of direct observation of unexposed 
      root systems of individual trees, especially when the scale of the analysis goes 
      down to the level of microbiomes. In the present study, we investigated the 
      contribution of tree root systems to bioweathering and soil production at the 
      macro- and microscale. Soil profiles developed under trees on granite bedrock 
      were investigated in two parts of the Sudety Mountains, SW Poland: the Rudawy 
      Janowickie Mountains, and the Stolowe Mountains. Soil profiles were gradually 
      excavated and soil samples collected from pre-defined positions of the root zone: 
      1) bulk soil, 2) rhizosphere, 3) cracks, 4) topsoil, and 5) control positions. In 
      total, we analyzed 103 samples for soil chemistry and microbiological activity. 
      In addition, we analyzed 19 samples using XRF (X-ray Fluorescence). Four parent 
      rock samples, in the form of thin-sections, were the subject of mineralogical 
      evaluation. Soil analyses included: total organic carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) 
      content, soil pH(H2O), soluble iron (Fe(d)), and aluminum (Al(d)), 
      non-crystalline (amorphous) iron (Fe(ox)), and aluminum (Al(ox)). For 
      microbiological analyses, we used a Biolog (EcoPlate) system to determine the 
      functional diversity of soil microorganisms. We evaluated the results on soil 
      chemistry and microbiological activity statistically by principal component 
      analysis (PCA) and redundancy analysis (RDA). Differences between soil sampling 
      positions were assessed using a non-parametric Kruskal-Wallis (K-W) rank sum test 
      and a post-hoc pairwise Dunn test. Trees developed different root architectures, 
      likely shaped by the depth to bedrock and its pre-existing net of fractures and 
      fissures. Tree roots were able to enter bedrock cracks at one study site (at 
      Pstrazna, Stolowe Mountains). The soil profile was too deep for root system 
      penetration at the second study site (Mt Janska, Rudawy Janowickie Mountains, 
      RJM). The rhizospheric soil along the roots had significantly different chemical 
      properties compared to non-rhizospheric soil types. At Mt. Janska, soil differed 
      from the crack soil in terms of Al(ox) (p(Holm-adj.) < 0.0006) and Fe(ox) 
      (p(Holm-adj.) < 0.004), and from the bulk soil (p(Holm-adj.) < 0.02) and topsoil 
      (p(Holm-adj.) < 0.007). In addition, at Pstrazna, the soil differed from the 
      control soil in terms of C (p(Holm-adj.) < 0.009) and soil pH(H2O) 
      (p(Holm-adj.) < 0.0008) and from the topsoil in terms of soil pH(H2O). The 
      highest metabolic activity was in cracks at Mt. Janska and in control samples 
      from Pstrazna. In general, the spatial distribution of soil microbial activity, 
      and the weathering that results from that portion of the soil biome, is spatially 
      heterogeneous and appears to be partially determined by the interaction of root 
      growth and bedrock fracture patterns.

AB  - The capacity for terrestrial ecosystems to sequester additional carbon (C) with 
      rising CO(2) concentrations depends on soil nutrient availability(1,2). Previous 
      evidence suggested that mature forests growing on phosphorus (P)-deprived soils 
      had limited capacity to sequester extra biomass under elevated CO(2) (refs. 
      (3-6)), but uncertainty about ecosystem P cycling and its CO(2) response 
      represents a crucial bottleneck for mechanistic prediction of the land C sink 
      under climate change(7). Here, by compiling the first comprehensive P budget for 
      a P-limited mature forest exposed to elevated CO(2), we show a high likelihood 
      that P captured by soil microorganisms constrains ecosystem P recycling and 
      availability for plant uptake. Trees used P efficiently, but microbial 
      pre-emption of mineralized soil P seemed to limit the capacity of trees for 
      increased P uptake and assimilation under elevated CO(2) and, therefore, their 
      capacity to sequester extra C. Plant strategies to stimulate microbial P cycling 
      and plant P uptake, such as increasing rhizosphere C release to soil, will 
      probably be necessary for P-limited forests to increase C capture into new 
      biomass. Our results identify the key mechanisms by which P availability limits 
      CO(2) fertilization of tree growth and will guide the development of Earth system 
      models to predict future long-term C storage.

AB  - Plant environmental stress response has become a global research hotspot, yet 
      there is a lack of clear understanding regarding the mechanisms that maintain 
      microbial diversity and their ecosystem services under environmental stress. In 
      our research, we examined the effects of moderate elevation on the rhizosphere 
      soil characteristics, microbial community composition, and ecosystem 
      multifunctionality (EMF) within agricultural systems. Our findings revealed a 
      notable negative correlation between EMF and elevation, indicating a decline in 
      multifunctionality at higher elevations. Additionally, our analysis across 
      bacterial and protistan communities showed a general decrease in microbial 
      richness with increasing elevation. Using random forest models, pH was identified 
      as the key environmental stressor influencing microbial communities. Furthermore, 
      we found that microbial community diversity is negatively correlated with 
      stability by mediating complexity. Interestingly, while pH was found to affect 
      the complexity within bacterial networks, it did not significantly impact the 
      ecosystem stability along the elevation gradients. Using a Binary-State 
      Speciation and Extinction (BiSSE) model to explore the evolutionary dynamics, we 
      found that Generalists had higher speciation rates and lower extinction rates 
      compared to specialists, resulting in a skewed distribution towards higher net 
      diversification for generalists under increasing environmental stress. Moreover, 
      structural equation modeling (SEM) analysis highlighted a negative correlation 
      between environmental stress and community diversity, but showed a positive 
      correlation between environmental stress and degree of cooperation & competition. 
      These interactions under environmental stress indirectly increased community 
      stability and decreased multifunctionality. Our comprehensive study offers 
      valuable insights into the intricate relationship among environmental factors, 
      microbial communities, and ecosystem functions, especially in the context of 
      varying elevation gradients. These findings contribute significantly to our 
      understanding of how environmental stressors affect microbial diversity and 
      ecosystem services, providing a foundation for future ecological research and 
      management strategies in similar contexts.

AB  - Root nitrogen (N) reallocation involves remobilization of root N-storage pools to 
      support shoot growth. Representing a critical yet underexplored facet of plant 
      function, we developed innovative frameworks to elucidate its connections with 
      key ecosystem components. First, root N reallocation increases with plant species 
      richness and N-acquisition strategies, driven by competitive stimulation of plant 
      N demand and synergies in N uptake. Second, competitive root traits and 
      mycorrhizal symbioses, which enhance N foraging and uptake, exhibit trade-offs 
      with root N reallocation. Furthermore, root N reallocation is attenuated by 
      N-supply attributes such as increasing litter quality, soil fungi-to-bacteria 
      ratios, and microbial recruitment in the hyphosphere/rhizosphere. These 
      frameworks provide new insights and research avenues for understanding the 
      ecological roles of root N reallocation.

AB  - Seventeen Gram-negative, facultatively anaerobic bacterial strains were isolated 
      from bleeding cankers of various broadleaf hosts and oak rhizosphere soil in 
      Great Britain. The strains were tentatively identified as belonging to the genus 
      Raoultella based on 16S rRNA gene sequencing. Multilocus sequence analysis 
      (MLSA), based on four protein-encoding genes (fusA, leuS, pyrG, and rpoB), 
      separated the strains into three clusters within the Raoultella genus clade. The 
      majority of strains clustered with the type strain of Raoultella terrigena, with 
      the remaining strains divided into two clusters with no known type strain. Whole 
      genome sequencing comparisons confirmed these two clusters of strains as 
      belonging to two novel Raoultella species which can be differentiated 
      phenotypically from their current closest phylogenetic relatives. Therefore, two 
      novel species are proposed: Raoultella scottia sp. nov. (type strain = BAC 
      10a-01-01(T) = LMG 33072(T) = CCUG 77096(T)) and Raoultella lignicola sp. nov. 
      (type strain = TW_WC1a.1(T) = LMG 33073(T) = CCUG 77094(T)).

TI  - Sex-specific phosphorus acquisition strategies and cycling in dioecious Populus

PG  - 3266-3281
LID - 10.1111/pce.14951 [doi]
AB  - Soil phosphorus (P) availability affects plant growth and distribution. However, 
      it is still unknown how sex-specific variation in functional traits affects 
      plants' P acquisition and soil P transformation. On wet sites, female poplars had 
      a greater specific root length (SRL), and a higher diversity of arbuscular 
      mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) and phosphate-solubilizing bacteria (PSB). Male poplars 
      living on wet sites increased the abundance of AMF and PSB communities and 
      enhanced moderately labile and highly resistant organic P mineralisation via 
      increased phosphatase activity. In contrast, on the dry site, the abundance and 
      diversity of AMF and PSB communities increased in females, enhancing moderately 
      labile and highly resistant organic P mineralisation via elevating phosphatase 
      activities. Males maintained greater SRL and promoted Ca-P mobilisation via the 
      release of root carboxylic acids and rhizosphere acidification on the dry site. 
      The AMF community diversity followed a similar pattern as that of the PSB 
      community when altering the P availability of different-sex plants. Our results 
      indicated that organic P and Ca-P are the major sources of plant-available P in 
      natural P. euphratica forests. Seasonal shifts and geographic locations affected 
      the share of organic and inorganic P pools, and AMF and PSB diversities, 
      ultimately altering sex-specific P acquisition strategies of plants.

AB  - Peanut root rot, commonly referred to as rat tail or root rot, is caused by a 
      range of Fusarium species. A strain of bacteria (named TG5) was isolated from 
      crop rhizosphere soil in Mount Taishan, Shandong Province, China, through whole 
      genome sequencing that TG5 was identified as Bacillus thuringiensis, which can 
      specifically produce chloramphenicol, bacitracin, clarithromycin, lichen 
      VK(21)A(1) and bacitracin, with good biological control potential. Based on 
      liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry metabonomics analysis and 
      transcriptome conjoint analysis, the mechanism of TG5 and carbendazim inducing 
      peanut plants to resist F. oxysporum stress was studied. In general, for peanut 
      root rot caused by F. oxysporum, B. thuringiensis TG5 has greater advantages than 
      carbendazim and is environmentally friendly. These findings provide new insights 
      for peanut crop genetics and breeding, and for microbial pesticides to replace 
      traditional highly toxic and highly polluting chemical pesticides. Based on the 
      current background of agricultural green cycle and sustainable development, it 
      has significant practical significance and broad application prospects.

TI  - Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi reduce soil N(2)O emissions by altering root traits 
      and soil denitrifier community composition.

AB  - Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) increase the ability of plants to obtain 
      nitrogen (N) from the soil, and thus can affect emissions of nitrous oxide 
      (N(2)O), a long-lived potent greenhouse gas. However, the mechanisms underlying 
      the effects of AMF on N(2)O emissions are still poorly understood, particularly 
      in agroecosystems with different forms of N fertilizer inputs. Utilizing a 
      mesocosm experiment in field, we examined the effects of AMF on N(2)O emissions 
      via their influence on maize root traits and denitrifying microorganisms under 
      ammonia and nitrate fertilizer input using (15)N isotope tracer. Here we show 
      that the presence of AMF alone or both maize roots and AMF increased maize 
      biomass and their (15)N uptake, root length, root surface area, and root volume, 
      but led to a reduction in N(2)O emissions under both N input forms. Random forest 
      model showed that root length and surface area were the most important predictors 
      of N(2)O emissions. Additionally, the presence of AMF reduced the 
      (nirK + nirS)/nosZ ratio by increasing the relative abundance of 
      nirS-Bradyrhizobium and Rubrivivax with ammonia input, but reducing 
      nosZ-Azospirillum, Cupriavidus and Rhodopseudomonas under both fertilizer input. 
      Further, N(2)O emissions were significantly and positively correlated with the 
      nosZ-type Azospirillum, Cupriavidus and Rhodopseudomonas, but negatively 
      correlated with the nirS-type Bradyrhizobium and Rubrivivax. These results 
      indicate that AMF reduce N(2)O emissions by increasing root length to explore N 
      nutrients and altering the community composition of denitrifiers, suggesting that 
      effective management of N fertilizer forms interacting with the rhizosphere 
      microbiome may help mitigate N(2)O emissions under future N input scenarios.

AB  - The dynamics of the physiological adaptability of plants and the rhizosphere soil 
      environment after waterlogging remain unclear. Here we investigated the 
      mechanisms regulating plant condition and shaping of the rhizosphere microbiome 
      in a pot experiment. In the experiment, we added melatonin to waterlogged plants, 
      which promoted waterlogging relief. The treatment significantly enhanced 
      photosynthesis and the antioxidant capacity of apple plants, and significantly 
      promoted nitrogen (N) utilization efficiency by upregulating genes related to N 
      transport and metabolism. Multiperiod soil microbiome analysis showed the dynamic 
      effects of melatonin on the diversity of the microbial community during 
      waterlogging recovery. Random forest and linear regression analyses were used to 
      screen for potential beneficial bacteria (e.g., Azoarcus, Pseudomonas and 
      Nocardioides) specifically regulated by melatonin and revealed a positive 
      correlation with soil nutrient levels and plant growth. Furthermore, metagenomic 
      analyses revealed the regulatory effects of melatonin on genes involved in N 
      cycling in soil. Melatonin positively contributed to the accumulation of plant 
      dry weight by upregulating the expression of nifD and nifK (N fixation). In 
      summary, melatonin positively regulates physiological functions in plants and the 
      structure and function of the microbial community; it promoted the recovery of 
      apple plants after waterlogging stress.

AB  - Spontaneous natural succession in metal mine tailings is fundamental to the 
      rehabilitation of bare tailing. Here, an abandoned rare earth element (REE) mine 
      tailing with spontaneous colonisation by pioneer plants with different functional 
      traits was selected. Soil nutrient cycling, fertility, organic matter 
      decomposition as well as underground organismal communities and their 
      multitrophic networks were investigated. Compared with the bare tailing, the 
      colonisation with Lycopodium japonicum, Miscanthus sinensis, and Dicranopteris 
      dichotoma increased soil multifunction by 222%, 293%, and 525%, respectively. 
      This was accompanied by significant changes in soil bacterial and protistan 
      community composition and increased soil multitrophic network complexity. 
      Rhizospheres of different plant species showed distinct microbial community 
      composition compared to that of bare tailing. Some WPS-2, Chloroflexi, and 
      Chlorophyta were mainly present in the bare tailing, while some Proteobacteria 
      and Cercozoa were predominantly seen in the rhizosphere. Pearson correlation and 
      Random Forest revealed the biotic factors driving soil multifunction. Structural 
      equation modelling further revealed that pioneer plants improved soil 
      multifunction primarily by decreasing the microbial biodiversity and increasing 
      the multitrophic network complexity. Overall, this highlights the importance of 
      subterrestrial organisms in accelerating soil rehabilitation during natural 
      succession and provides options for the ecological restoration of degraded REE 
      mining areas.

AB  - Strigolactones are a class of phytohormones with various functions in plant 
      development, stress responses, and in the interaction with (micro)organisms in 
      the rhizosphere. While their effects on vegetative development are well studied, 
      little is known about their role in reproduction. We investigated the effects of 
      genetic and chemical modification of strigolactone levels on the timing and 
      intensity of flowering in tomato (Solanum lycopersicum L.) and the molecular 
      mechanisms underlying such effects. Results showed that strigolactone levels in 
      the shoot, whether endogenous or exogenous, correlate inversely with the time of 
      anthesis and directly with the number of flowers and the transcript levels of the 
      florigen-encoding gene SINGLE FLOWER TRUSS (SFT) in the leaves. Transcript 
      quantifications coupled with metabolite analyses demonstrated that strigolactones 
      promote flowering in tomato by inducing the activation of the 
      microRNA319-LANCEOLATE module in leaves. This, in turn, decreases gibberellin 
      content and increases the transcription of SFT. Several other floral markers and 
      morpho-anatomical features of developmental progression are induced in the apical 
      meristems upon treatment with strigolactones, affecting floral transition and, 
      more markedly, flower development. Thus, strigolactones promote meristem 
      maturation and flower development via the induction of SFT both before and after 
      floral transition, and their effects are blocked in plants expressing a 
      miR319-resistant version of LANCEOLATE. Our study positions strigolactones in the 
      context of the flowering regulation network in a model crop species.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Bamboo can be used in the phytoremediation of heavy metal 
      pollution. However, the characteristics of the bamboo rhizosphere archaeal 
      community in Cr-contaminated soil under field conditions remain unclear. METHODS: 
      In this study, high-throughput sequencing was used to examine the rhizosphere 
      soil archaeal communities of Lei bamboo (Phyllostachys precox) plantations along 
      a Cr pollution gradient. RESULTS: The results revealed U-shaped relationships 
      between Cr [total Cr (TCr) or HCl-extractable Cr (ACr)] and two alpha indices 
      (Chao1 and Shannon) of archaea. We also established that high Cr concentrations 
      were associated with a significant increase in the abundance of Thaumarchaeota 
      and significant reductions in the abundances of Crenarchaeota and Euryarchaeota. 
      The archaeal co-occurrence networks reduced in complexity with Cr pollution, 
      decreasing the community's resistance to environmental disturbance. Candidatus 
      nitrosotalea and Nitrososphaeraceae_unclassified (two genera of Thaumarchaeota) 
      were identified as keystone taxa. The community structure of soil archaeal 
      communities was also found to be affected by TCr, ACr, pH, total organic C, and 
      available nutrient (N, P, and K) concentrations, with pH being identified as the 
      most reliable predictor of the archaeal community in assessed soils. DISCUSSION: 
      These findings enhance our understanding of microbial responses to Cr pollution 
      and provide a basis for developing more refined approaches for the use of bamboo 
      in the remediation of Cr-contaminated soils.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Soil physicochemical properties and nutrient composition play a 
      significant role in shaping microbial communities, and facilitating soil 
      phosphorus (P) transformation. However, studies on the mechanisms of interactions 
      between P transformation characteristics and rhizosphere microbial diversity in 
      P-deficient soils on longer time scales are still limited. METHODS: In this 
      study, rhizosphere soils were collected from a pure plantation of Parashorea 
      chinensis (P. chinensis) at six stand ages in the subtropical China, and the 
      dynamic transformation characteristics of microbial diversity and P fractions 
      were analyzed to reveal the variation of their interactions with age. RESULTS: 
      Our findings revealed that the rhizosphere soils across stand ages were in a 
      strongly acidic and P-deficient state, with pH values ranging from 3.4 to 4.6, 
      and available P contents ranging from 2.6 to 7.9 mg.kg(-1). The adsorption of P 
      by Fe(3+) and presence of high levels of steady-state organic P highly restricted 
      the availability of P in soil. On long time scales, acid phosphatase activity and 
      microbial biomass P were the main drivers of P activation. Moreover, pH, 
      available P, and ammonium nitrogen were identified as key factors driving 
      microbial community diversity. As stand age increased, most of the nutrient 
      content indicators firstly increased and then decreased, the conversion of other 
      forms of P to bio-available P became difficult, P availability and soil fertility 
      began to decline. However, bacteria were still able to maintain stable species 
      abundance and diversity. In contrast, stand age had a greater effect on the 
      diversity of the fungal community than on the bacteria. The Shannon and Simpson 
      indices varied by 4.81 and 0.70 for the fungi, respectively, compared to only 
      1.91 and 0.06 for the bacteria. Microorganisms play a dominant role in the 
      development of their relationship with soil P. DISCUSSION: In conclusion, 
      rhizosphere microorganisms in P. chinensis plantations gradually adapt to the 
      acidic, low P environment over time. This adaptation is conducive to maintaining 
      P bioeffectiveness and alleviating P limitation.

AB  - In situ measurement of the bioavailability of organic pollutants in soil is 
      crucial for understanding their environmental behavior and assessing health 
      risks. Due to the high heterogeneity of soil, microscale determination is crucial 
      for achieving high accuracy, but few methods are available. In this study, 
      microsized probes coated with polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) were used to measure 
      the bioavailability of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in soil in situ. 
      The concentrations of PAHs enriched by the PDMS-coated probes correlated well 
      with the results of bioassays using earthworms (R(2) = 0.92-0.99) and ryegrass 
      roots (R(2) = 0.92-0.99). Compared with other chemical extraction methods, such 
      as n-butanol extraction, the proposed method has advantages such as in situ 
      operation, microvolume analysis, and negligible interference to the soil 
      environment. In the soil rhizosphere zone, PAHs bioavailability decreased in the 
      following order: rhizosphere > near-rhizosphere > far-rhizosphere. The 
      bioavailability of PAHs in soil amended with biochar was also successfully 
      characterized by the proposed method. Thus, this study developed an in situ and 
      microscale method to predict the bioavailability of organic pollutants in 
      contaminated soils and provides new insight into migration and transformation 
      processes in rhizosphere soil.

AB  - The deoxynivalenol (DON)-degrading bacterium JB1-3-2( T) was isolated from a 
      rhizosphere soil sample of cucumber collected from a greenhouse located in 
      Zhenjiang, Eastern China. The JB1-3-2( T) strain is a Gram-stain-positive, 
      nonmotile and round actinomycete. Growth was observed at temperatures between 15 
      and 40 ℃ (optimum, 35 ℃), in the presence of 15% (w/v) NaCl (optimum, 3%), and at 
      pH 3 and 11 (optimum, 7). The major cellular fatty acids identified were 
      anteiso-C(15:0), iso-C(16:0) and anteiso-C(17:0). Genome sequencing revealed a 
      genome size of 4.11 Mb and a DNA G + C content of 72.5 mol%. Phylogenetic 
      analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequences indicated that the JB1-3-2( T) strain 
      was most closely related to type strains of the Oerskovia species, with the 
      highest sequence similarity to Oerskovia turbata NRRL B-8019( T) (98.2%), and 
      shared 98.1% sequence identity with other valid type strains of this genus. 
      Digital DNA‒DNA hybridization (dDDH) and average nucleotide identity (ANI) showed 
      21.8-22.2% and 77.2-77.3% relatedness, respectively, between JB1-3-2( T) and type 
      strains of the genus Oerskovia. Based on genotypic, phylogenetic, chemotaxonomic, 
      physiological and biochemical characterization, Oerskovia flava, a novel species 
      in the genus Oerskovia, was proposed, and the type strain was JB1-3-2( T) 
      (= CGMCC 1.18555( T) = JCM 35248( T)). Additionally, this novel strain has a DON 
      degradation ability that other species in the genus Oerskovia do not possess, and 
      glutathione-S-transferase was speculated to be the key enzyme for strain 
      JB1-3-2( T) to degrade DON.

TI  - The Combination of Biochar and Bacillus subtilis Biological Agent Reduced the 
      Relative Abundance of Pathogenic Bacteria in the Rhizosphere Soil of Panax 
      notoginseng.
LID - 10.3390/microorganisms12040783 [doi]
LID - 783
AB  - In the continuous cropping of Panax notoginseng, the pathogenic fungi in the 
      rhizosphere soil increased and infected the roots of Panax notoginseng, resulting 
      in a decrease in yield. This is an urgent problem that needs to be solved in 
      order to effectively overcome the obstacles associated with the continuous 
      cropping of Panax notoginseng. Previous studies have shown that Bacillus subtilis 
      inhibits pathogenic fungi in the rhizosphere of Panax notoginseng, but the 
      inhibitory effect was not stable. Therefore, we hope to introduce biochar to help 
      Bacillus subtilis colonize in soil. In the experiment, fields planted with Panax 
      notoginseng for 5 years were renovated, and biochar was mixed in at the same 
      time. The applied amount of biochar was set to four levels (B0, 10 kg.hm(-2); B1, 
      80 kg.hm(-2); B2, 110 kg.hm(-2); B3, 140 kg.hm(-2)), and Bacillus subtilis 
      biological agent was set to three levels (C1, 10 kg.hm(-2); C2, 15 kg.hm(-2); C3, 
      25 kg.hm(-2)). The full combination experiment and a blank control group (CK) 
      were used. The experimental results show that the overall Ascomycota decreased by 
      0.86%~65.68% at the phylum level. Basidiomycota increased by -73.81%~138.47%, and 
      Mortierellomycota increased by -51.27%~403.20%. At the genus level, Mortierella 
      increased by -10.29%~855.44%, Fusarium decreased by 35.02%~86.79%, and 
      Ilyonectria increased by -93.60%~680.62%. Fusarium mainly causes acute bacterial 
      wilt root rot, while Ilyonectria mainly causes yellow rot. Under different 
      treatments, the Shannon index increased by -6.77%~62.18%, the Chao1 index 
      increased by -12.07%~95.77%, the Simpson index increased by -7.31%~14.98%, and 
      the ACE index increased by -11.75%~96.12%. The good_coverage indices were all 
      above 0.99. The results of a random forest analysis indicated that Ilyonectria, 
      Pyrenochaeta, and Xenopolyscytalum were the top three most important species in 
      the soil, with MeanDecreaseGini values of 2.70, 2.50, and 2.45, respectively. 
      Fusarium, the primary pathogen of Panax notoginseng, ranked fifth, and its 
      MeanDecreaseGini value was 2.28. The experimental results showed that the B2C2 
      treatment had the best inhibitory effect on Fusarium, and the relative abundance 
      of Fusarium in Panax notoginseng rhizosphere soil decreased by 86.79% under B2C2 
      treatment; the B1C2 treatment had the best inhibitory effect on Ilyonectria, and 
      the relative abundance of Ilyonectria in the Panax notoginseng rhizosphere soil 
      decreased by 93.60% under B1C2 treatment. Therefore, if we want to improve the 
      soil with acute Ralstonia solanacearum root rot, we should use the B2C2 treatment 
      to improve the soil environment; if we want to improve the soil with yellow rot 
      disease, we should use the B1C2 treatment to improve the soil environment.

TI  - Response of Phyllosphere and Rhizosphere Microbial Communities to Salt Stress of 
      Tamarix chinensis.
LID - 10.3390/plants13081091 [doi]
LID - 1091
AB  - As carriers of direct contact between plants and the atmospheric environment, the 
      microbiomes of phyllosphere microorganisms are increasingly recognized as an 
      important area of study. Salt secretion triggered by salt-secreting halophytes 
      elicits changes in the community structure and functions of phyllosphere 
      microorganisms, and often provides positive feedback to the individual 
      plant/community environment. In this study, the contents of Na(+) and K(+) in the 
      rhizosphere, plant and phyllosphere of Tamarix chinensis were increased under 200 
      mmol/L NaCl stress. The increase in electrical conductivity, Na(+) and K(+) in 
      the phyllosphere not only decreased the diversity of bacterial and fungal 
      communities, but also decreased the relative abundance of Actinobacteriota and 
      Basidiomycota. Influenced by electrical conductivity and Na(+), the 
      bacteria-fungus co-occurrence network under salt stress has higher complexity. 
      Changes in the structure of the phyllosphere microbial community further resulted 
      in a significant increase in the relative abundance of the bacterial energy 
      source and fungal pathotrophic groups. The relative abundance of Actinobacteriota 
      and Acidobacteriota in rhizosphere showed a decreasing trend under salt stress, 
      while the complexity of the rhizosphere co-occurrence network was higher than 
      that of the control. In addition, the relative abundances of functional groups of 
      rhizosphere bacteria in the carbon cycle and phosphorus cycle increased 
      significantly under stress, and were significantly correlated with electrical 
      conductivity and Na(+). This study investigated the effects of salinity on the 
      structure and physicochemical properties of phyllosphere and rhizosphere 
      microbial communities of halophytes, and highlights the role of phyllosphere 
      microbes as ecological indicators in plant responses to stressful environments.

TI  - Community coalescence and plant host filtering determine the spread of 
      tetracycline resistance genes from pig manure into the microbiome continuum of 
      the soil-plant system.

AB  - The spread of livestock manure-borne antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) into 
      agroecosystems through manure application poses a potential threat to human 
      health. However, there is still a knowledge gap concerning ARG dissemination in 
      coalescing manure, soil and plant microbiomes. Here, we examined the fate of 
      tetracycline resistance genes (TRGs) originating from pig manure microbiomes and 
      spread in the soil-A thaliana system and explored the effects of microbial 
      functions on TRGs spread at different interfaces. Our results indicate that the 
      TRGs abundances in all microbiome continuum of the soil-A. thaliana system were 
      significantly increased with the application of a living manure microbiome, 
      although the addition of manure with both an active and inactive microbiome 
      caused a shift in the microbial community composition. This was attributed to the 
      increasing relative abundances of tetA, tetL, tetM, tetO, tetW and tolC in the 
      system. The application of living manure with DOX residues resulted in the 
      highest relative abundance of total TRGs (3.30x10(-3) copies/16S rRNA gene 
      copies) in the rhizosphere soil samples. Community coalescence of the manure and 
      soil microbiomes increased the abundance of Firmicutes in the soil and root 
      microbiome, which directly explains the increase in TRG abundance observed in 
      these interfaces. In contrast, the leaf microbiome differed markedly from that of 
      the remaining samples, indicating strong plant host filtering effects on 
      Firmicutes and TRGs from pig manure. The random forest machine learning model 
      revealed microbial functions and their significant positive correlation with TRG 
      abundance in the microbiome continuum of the system. Our findings revealed that 
      community coalescence is the main driver of TRG spread from manure to the soil 
      and root microbiomes. Plant host filtering effects play a crucial role in 
      allowing certain microbial groups to occupy ecological niches in the leaves, 
      thereby limiting the establishment of manure-borne TRGs in aboveground plant 
      tissues.

AB  - Intercropping-driven changes in nitrogen (N)-acquiring microbial genomes and 
      functional expression regulate soil N availability and plant N uptake. However, 
      present data seem to be limited to a specific community, obscuring the viewpoint 
      of entire N-acquiring microbiomes and functions. Taking maize intercropped with 
      legumes (peanut and soybean) and non-legumes (gingelly and sweet potato) as 
      models, we studied the effects of intercropping on N transformations and 
      N-acquiring microbiomes in rhizosphere soil across four maize growth stages. 
      Meanwhile, we compiled promising strategies such as random forest analysis and 
      structural equation model for the exploitation of the associations between 
      microbe-driven N dynamics and soil-plant N trade-offs and maize productivity. 
      Compared with monoculture, maize intercropping significantly increased the 
      denitrification rate of rhizosphere soils across four maize growth stages, net N 
      mineralization in the elongation and flowering stages, and the nitrification rate 
      in the seedling and mature stages. The abundance of most N-acquiring microbial 
      populations was influenced significantly by intercropping patterns and maize 
      growth stages. Soil available N components (NH(4)(+)-N, NO(3)(-)-N, and dissolved 
      organic N content) showed a highly direct effect on plant N uptake, which mainly 
      mediated by N transformations (denitrification rate) and N-acquiring populations 
      (amoB, nirK3, and hzsB genes). Overall, the adaptation of N-acquiring microbiomes 
      to changing rhizosphere micro-environments caused by intercropping patterns and 
      maize development could promote soil N transformations and dynamics to meet 
      demand of maize for N nutrient. This would offer another unique perspective to 
      manage the benefits of the highly N-effective and production-effective 
      intercropping ecosystems.

AB  - The aim of this study was to reveal the stoichiometric characteristics of carbon, 
      nitrogen and phosphorus in rhizosphere and non-rhizosphere soils of Pinus 
      sylvestris var. mongolica in the Hulunbuir desert. We investigated the contents 
      and stoichiometry of organic carbon, total nitrogen, and total phosphorus 
      contents of rhizosphere and non-rhizosphere soils across different stand ages 
      (28, 37 and 46 a) of P. sylvestris var. mongolica plantations, with P. sylvestris 
      var. mongolica natural forest as the control. We analyzed the correlation between 
      soils properties and soil stoichiometry. The results showed that rhizosphere 
      effect significantly affected soil N:P, and stand age significantly affected soil 
      organic carbon content in P. sylvestris var. mongolica plantation. Soil organic 
      carbon content in plantation was significantly lower than that in natural forest. 
      Soil organic carbon and total nitrogen contents of plantations in both 
      rhizosphere and non-rhizosphere soils firstly decreased and then increased with 
      increasing stand age, while total phosphorus firstly increased and then decreased 
      in rhizosphere soils, and firstly decreased and then increased in non-rhizosphere 
      soils. There was significant positive correlations between C:N and C:P in 
      rhizosphere soils but not in non-rhizosphere soils, suggesting that higher 
      synergistic rhizosphere soil N and P limitation. The mean N:P values of 
      rhizosphere and non-rhizosphere soils were 4.98 and 8.40, respectively, 
      indicating that the growth of P. sylvestris var. mongolica was restricted by soil 
      N and the rhizosphere soils were more N-restricted. The C:N:P stoichiometry of 
      rhizosphere and non-rhizosphere soils were significantly influenced by soil 
      properties, with available phosphorus being the most important driver. The growth 
      of P. sylvestris var. mongolica was limited by N in the Hulunbuir desert, and 
      root system played an obvious role in enriching and maintaining soil nutrients. 
      It was recommended that soil nitrogen should be supplemented appropriately during 
      the growth stage of P. sylvestris var. mongolica plantation, and phosphorus 
      should be supplemented appropriately according to the synergistic nature of 
      nitrogen and phosphorus limitation.

AB  - Understanding belowground plant-microbial interactions is important for 
      biodiversity maintenance, community assembly and ecosystem functioning of forest 
      ecosystems. Consequently, a large number of studies were conducted on root and 
      microbial interactions, especially in the context of precipitation and 
      temperature gradients under global climate change scenarios. Forests ecosystems 
      have high biodiversity of plants and associated microbes, and contribute to major 
      primary productivity of terrestrial ecosystems. However, the impact of root 
      metabolites/exudates and root traits on soil microbial functional groups along 
      these climate gradients is poorly described in these forest ecosystems. The plant 
      root system exhibits differentiated exudation profiles and considerable trait 
      plasticity in terms of root morphological/phenotypic traits, which can cause 
      shifts in microbial abundance and diversity. The root metabolites composed of 
      primary and secondary metabolites and volatile organic compounds that have 
      diverse roles in appealing to and preventing distinct microbial strains, thus 
      benefit plant fitness and growth, and tolerance to abiotic stresses such as 
      drought. Climatic factors significantly alter the quantity and quality of 
      metabolites that forest trees secrete into the soil. Thus, the heterogeneities in 
      the rhizosphere due to different climate drivers generate ecological niches for 
      various microbial assemblages to foster beneficial rhizospheric interactions in 
      the forest ecosystems. However, the root exudations and microbial diversity in 
      forest trees vary across different soil layers due to alterations in root system 
      architecture, soil moisture, temperature, and nutrient stoichiometry. Changes in 
      root system architecture or traits, e.g. root tissue density (RTD), specific root 
      length (SRL), and specific root area (SRA), impact the root exudation profile and 
      amount released into the soil and thus influence the abundance and diversity of 
      different functional guilds of microbes. Here, we review the current knowledge 
      about root morphological and functional (root exudation) trait changes that 
      affect microbial interactions along drought and temperature gradients. This 
      review aims to clarify how forest trees adapt to challenging environments by 
      leveraging their root traits to interact beneficially with microbes. 
      Understanding these strategies is vital for comprehending plant adaptation under 
      global climate change, with significant implications for future research in plant 
      biodiversity conservation, particularly within forest ecosystems.

AB  - Understanding rhizosphere microbial ecology is necessary to reveal the interplay 
      between plants and associated microbial communities. The significance of 
      rhizosphere-microbial interactions in plant growth promotion, mediated by several 
      key processes such as auxin synthesis, enhanced nutrient uptake, stress 
      alleviation, disease resistance, etc., is unquestionable and well reported in 
      numerous literature. Moreover, rhizosphere research has witnessed tremendous 
      progress due to the integration of the metagenomics approach and further shift in 
      our viewpoint from taxonomic to functional diversity over the past decades. The 
      microbial functional genes corresponding to the beneficial functions provide a 
      solid foundation for the successful establishment of positive plant-microbe 
      interactions. The microbial functional gene composition in the rhizosphere can be 
      regulated by several factors, e.g., the nutritional requirements of plants, soil 
      chemistry, soil nutrient status, pathogen attack, abiotic stresses, etc. Knowing 
      the pattern of functional gene composition in the rhizosphere can shed light on 
      the dynamics of rhizosphere microbial ecology and the strength of cooperation 
      between plants and associated microbes. This knowledge is crucial to realizing 
      how microbial functions respond to unprecedented challenges which are obvious in 
      the Anthropocene. Unraveling how microbes-mediated beneficial functions will 
      change under the influence of several challenges, requires knowledge of the 
      pattern and composition of functional genes corresponding to beneficial functions 
      such as biogeochemical functions (nutrient cycle), plant growth promotion, stress 
      mitigation, etc. Here, we focus on the molecular traits of plant growth-promoting 
      functions delivered by a set of microbial functional genes that can be useful to 
      the emerging field of rhizosphere functional ecology.

AB  - Mining tailings containing large amounts of Pb and Cd cause severe regional 
      ecosystem pollution. Soil microorganisms play a regulatory role in the 
      restoration of degraded ecosystems. The remediation of heavy metal-contaminated 
      tailings with amendments and economically valuable Eucalyptus camaldulensis is a 
      research hotspot due to its cost-effectiveness and sustainability. However, the 
      succession and co-occurrence patterns of these microbial communities in this 
      context remain unclear. Tailing samples of five kinds of Cd and Pb were collected 
      in E. camaldulensis restoration models. Physicochemical properties, the 
      proportions of different Cd and Pb forms, microbial community structure, and the 
      co-occurrence network of rhizosphere tailings during different restoration 
      process (organic bacterial manure, organic manure, inorganic fertilizer, 
      bacterial agent) were considered. Organic and organic bacterial manures 
      significantly increased pH, cation exchange capacity, and the proportion of 
      residual Pb. Still, there was a significant decrease in the proportion of 
      reducible Pb. The changes in microbial communities were related to 
      physicochemical properties and the types of amendments. Organic and organic 
      bacterium manures decreased the relative abundance of oligotrophic groups and 
      increased the relative abundance of syntrophic groups. Inorganic fertilizers and 
      bacterial agents decreased the relative abundance of saprophytic fungi. B. 
      subtilis would play a better role in the environment improved by organic manure, 
      increasing the relative abundance of beneficial microorganism and reducing the 
      relative abundance of pathogenic microorganism. pH, cation exchange capacity, and 
      the proportion of different forms of Pb were the main factors affecting the 
      bacterial and fungi variation. All four amendments transformed the main critical 
      groups of the microbial network structure from acidophilus and pathogenic 
      microorganisms to beneficial microorganisms. Heavy metal-resistant 
      microorganisms, stress-resistant microorganisms, beneficial microorganisms that 
      promote nutrient cycling, and copiotrophic groups have become critical to 
      building stable rhizosphere microbial communities. The topological properties and 
      stability of the rhizosphere co-occurrence network were also enhanced. Adding 
      organic and organic bacterium manures combined with E. camaldulensis to repair Cd 
      and Pb tailings improved (1) pH and cation exchange capacity, (2) reduced the 
      biological toxicity of Pb, (3) enhanced the stability of microbial networks, and 
      (4) improved ecological network relationships. These positive changes are 
      conducive to the restoration of the ecological functions of tailings.

AB  - Phytoremediation using fast-growing woody plants assisted by plant 
      growth-promoting bacteria (PGPB) on cadmium (Cd)-contaminated sites is considered 
      a promising technique; however, its remediation efficiency is still affected by 
      multiple factors. In this study, the mining areas' soil conditions were simulated 
      with different Cd addition levels (0, 3, 6, 9 mg kg(-1)) in order to investigate 
      the response strategy to Cd stress of fast-growing economic tree species, slash 
      pine (Pinus elliottii), and the effects of inoculation with the PGPB strain 
      Herbaspirillum sp. YTG72 on the physiological activity and Cd accumulation of 
      plants. The main results showed that there were significant (p < 0.05) increases 
      in contents of chlorophyll and nutrient elements (P, K, Ca, and Mg) at low Cd 
      addition level (3 mg kg(-1)) compared to non-Cd addition treatment. When the 
      additive amount of Cd increased, the growth of plants was severely inhibited and 
      the content of proline was increased, as well as Cd in plants. Besides, the 
      ratios of K:P, Ca:P, and Mg:P in plants were negatively correlated with the 
      contents of Cd in plants and soils. Inoculation of P. elliottii with the PGPB 
      strain Herbaspirillum sp. YTG72 improved the physiological functions of the 
      plants under Cd stress and activated the antioxidant system, reduced the 
      accumulation of proline, and decreased the ratios of K:P, Ca:P, and Mg:P in 
      plant. More importantly, planting P. elliottii in Cd-contaminated soil could 
      significantly (p < 0.05) reduce the Cd content in the rhizosphere soil, and 
      furthermore, inoculation treatment could promote the reduction of soil Cd content 
      and increased the accumulation of Cd by root. The results of the present study 
      emphasized the Cd response mechanism of P. elliottii based on multifaceted 
      regulation, as well as the feasibility of strain Herbaspirillum sp. YTG72 
      assisted P. elliottii for the remediation on Cd-contaminated sites.

AB  - Fungi are among key actors in the biogeochemical processes occurring in mangrove 
      ecosystems. In this study, we investigated the changes of fungal communities in 
      selected mangrove species by exploring differences in diversity, structure and 
      the degree of ecological rearrangement occurring within the rhizospheres of four 
      mangrove species (Sonneratia alba, Rhizophora mucronata, Ceriops tagal and 
      Avicennia marina) at Gazi Bay and Mida Creek in Kenya. Alpha diversity 
      investigation revealed that there were no significant differences in species 
      diversity between the same mangrove species in the different sites. Rather, 
      significant differences were observed in fungal richness for some of the mangrove 
      species. Chemical parameters of the mangrove sediment significantly correlated 
      with fungal alpha diversity and inversely with richness. The fungal community 
      structure was significantly differentiated by mangrove species, geographical 
      location and chemical parameters. Taxonomic analysis revealed that 96% of the 
      amplicon sequence variants belonged to the Phylum Ascomycota, followed by 
      Basidiomycota (3%). Predictive FUNGuild and co-occurrence network analysis 
      revealed that the fungal communities in Gazi Bay were metabolically more diverse 
      compared to those of Mida Creek. Overall, our results demonstrate that 
      anthropogenic activities influenced fungal richness, community assembly and their 
      potential ecological functions in the mangrove ecosystems investigated.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Soil salinity negatively affects crop development. 
      Halotolerant nitrogen-fixing bacteria (HNFB) and arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi 
      (AMF) are essential microorganisms that enhance crop nutrient availability and 
      salt tolerance in saline soils. Studying the impact of HNFB on AMF communities 
      and using HNFB in biofertilizers can help in selecting the optimal HNFB-AMF 
      combinations to improve crop productivity in saline soils. METHODS: We 
      established three experimental groups comprising apple plants treated with 
      low-nitrogen (0 mg N/kg, N0), normal-nitrogen (200 mg N/kg, N1), and 
      high-nitrogen (300 mg N/kg, N2) fertilizer under salt stress without bacteria 
      (CK, with the addition of 1,500 mL sterile water +2 g sterile diatomite), or with 
      bacteria [BIO, with the addition of 1,500 mL sterile water +2 g mixed bacterial 
      preparation (including Bacillus subtilis HG-15 and Bacillus velezensis JC-K3)]. 
      RESULTS: HNFB inoculation significantly increased microbial biomass and the 
      relative abundance of beta-glucosidase-related genes in the rhizosphere soil 
      under identical nitrogen application levels (p < 0.05). High-nitrogen treatment 
      significantly reduced AMF diversity and the relative abundance of 
      beta-glucosidase, acid phosphatase, and urea-related genes. A two-way analysis of 
      variance showed that combined nitrogen application and HNFB treatment could 
      significantly affect soil physicochemical properties and rhizosphere AMF 
      abundance (p < 0.05). Specifically, HNFB application resulted in a significantly 
      higher relative abundance of Glomus-MO-G17-VTX00114 compared to that in the CK 
      group at equal nitrogen levels. CONCLUSION: The impact of HNFB on the AMF 
      community in apple rhizospheres is influenced by soil nitrogen levels. The study 
      reveals how varying nitrogen levels mediate the relationship between exogenous 
      HNFB, soil properties, and rhizosphere microbes.

AB  - Dominant native plants are crucial for vegetation reconstruction and ecological 
      restoration of mining areas, though their adaptation mechanisms in stressful 
      environments are unclear. This study focuses on the interactions between dominant 
      indigenous species in antimony (Sb) mining area, Artemisia lavandulaefolia and 
      Betula luminifera, and the microbes in their rhizosphere. The rhizosphere 
      microbial diversity and potential functions of both plants were analyzed through 
      the utilization of 16S, ITS sequencing, and metabarcoding analysis. The results 
      revealed that soil environmental factors, rather than plant species, had a more 
      significant impact on the composition of the rhizosphere microbial community. 
      Soil pH and moisture significantly affected microbial biomarkers and keystone 
      species. Actinobacteria, Proteobacteria and Acidobacteriota, exhibited high 
      resistance to Sb and As, and played a crucial role in the cycling of carbon, 
      nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), and sulfur (S). The genes participating in N, P, 
      and S cycling exhibited metabolic coupling with those genes associated with Sb 
      and As resistance, which might have enhanced the rhizosphere microbes' capacity 
      to endure environmental stressors. The enrichment of these rhizosphere functional 
      microbes is the combined result of dispersal limitations and deterministic 
      assembly processes. Notably, the genes related to quorum sensing, the type III 
      secretion system, and chemotaxis systems were significantly enriched in the 
      rhizosphere of plants, especially in B. luminifera, in the mining area. The 
      phylogenetic tree derived from the evolutionary relationships among rhizosphere 
      microbial and chloroplast whole-genome resequencing results, infers both species 
      especially B. luminifera, may have undergone co-evolution with rhizosphere 
      microorganisms in mining areas. These findings offer valuable insights into the 
      dominant native rhizosphere microorganisms that facilitate plant adaptation to 
      environmental stress in mining areas, thereby shedding light on potential 
      strategies for ecological restoration in such environments.

AB  - Root rot is one of the main reasons for yield losses of red kidney bean 
      (Phaseolus vulgaris) production. Pre-inoculation with Trichoderma harzianum can 
      effectively lower the incidence of red kidney bean root rot. In this study, four 
      treatments including CK (control), Fu13 (Fusarium oxysporum), T891 (T. harzianum) 
      and T891 + Fu13 (T. harzianum + F. oxysporum) were arranged in a pot experiment 
      to investigate how T891 affected the incidence and severity of root rot, plant 
      growth, and changes of defense enzyme activity in red kidney bean plants. 
      Community composition and diversity of the rhizosphere microbiota was evaluated 
      through high-throughput sequencing, and co-occurrence network was analyzed. The 
      results showed that when compared to the Fu13 treatment, pre-inoculation with 
      T891 reduced the incidence and severity of red kidney bean root rot by 40.62 and 
      68.03% (p < 0.05), increased the root length, shoot length, total dry biomass by 
      48.63, 97.72, 122.17%. Upregulated activity of super-oxide dismutase (SOD), 
      peroxidase (POD), catalase (CAT) by 7.32, 38.48, 98.31% (p < 0.05), and reduced 
      malondialdehyde (MDA) by 23.70% (p < 0.05), respectively. Microbiological 
      analyses also showed that F. oxysporum reduced alpha diversity resulting in 
      alteration the composition of the rhizosphere microbial community in red kidney 
      bean. T891 significantly reduced abundance of F. oxysporum, allowing the 
      enrichment of potentially beneficial bacteria Porphyrobacter (ASV 46), Lysobacter 
      (ASV 85), Microbacteriaceae (ASV 105), and Gemmatimonas (ASV 107), resulting in a 
      more stable structure of the microbial network. The results of random forest 
      analysis further revealed that ASV 46 (Porphyrobacter) was the primary 
      influencing factor for the incidence of root rot after inoculation with T891, 
      while ASV 85 (Lysobacter) was the primary influencing factor for the biomass of 
      red kidney bean. In conclusion, T. harzianum promotes the growth of red kidney 
      bean and inhibits root rot by improving plant antioxidant enzyme activity and 
      regulating the rhizosphere microbial community.

AB  - Phytochemicals and their ecological significance are long ignored in trait-based 
      ecology. Moreover, the adaptations of phytochemicals produced by fine roots to 
      abiotic and biotic pressures are less understood. Here, we explored the fine 
      roots metabolomes of 315 tree species and their rhizosphere microbiome in 
      southwestern China spanning tropical, subtropical, and subalpine forest 
      ecosystems, to explore phytochemical diversity and endemism patterns of various 
      metabolic pathways and phytochemical-microorganism interactions. We found that 
      subalpine species showed higher phytochemical diversity but lower interspecific 
      variation than tropical species, which favors coping with high abiotic pressures. 
      Tropical species harbored higher interspecific phytochemical variation and 
      phytochemical endemism, which favors greater species coexistence and adaptation 
      to complex biotic pressures. Moreover, there was evidence of widespread chemical 
      niche partitioning of closely related species in all regions, and phytochemicals 
      showed a weak phylogenetic signal, but were regulated by abiotic and biotic 
      pressures. Our findings support the Latitudinal Biotic Interaction Hypothesis, 
      i.e., the intensity of phytochemical-microorganism interactions decreases from 
      tropical to subalpine regions, which promotes greater microbial community 
      turnover and phytochemical niche partitioning of host plants in the tropics than 
      in higher latitude forests. Our study reveals the convergent phytochemical 
      diversity patterns of various pathways and their interactions with microorganism, 
      thus promoting species coexistence.

TI  - Strategies of plants to overcome abiotic and biotic stresses.
PG  - 1524-1536
LID - 10.1111/brv.13079 [doi]
AB  - In their environment, plants are exposed to a multitude of abiotic and biotic 
      stresses that differ in intensity, duration and severity. As sessile organisms, 
      they cannot escape these stresses, but instead have developed strategies to 
      overcome them or to compensate for the consequences of stress exposure. Defence 
      can take place at different levels and the mechanisms involved are thought to 
      differ in efficiency across these levels. To minimise metabolic constraints and 
      to reduce the costs of stress defence, plants prioritise first-line defence 
      strategies in the apoplastic space, involving ascorbate, defensins and small 
      peptides, as well as secondary metabolites, before cellular processes are 
      affected. In addition, a large number of different symplastic mechanisms also 
      provide efficient stress defence, including chemical antioxidants, antioxidative 
      enzymes, secondary metabolites, defensins and other peptides as well as proteins. 
      At both the symplastic and the apoplastic level of stress defence and 
      compensation, a number of specialised transporters are thought to be involved in 
      exchange across membranes that still have not been identified, and information on 
      the regeneration of different defence compounds remains ambiguous. In addition, 
      strategies to overcome and compensate for stress exposure operate not only at the 
      cellular, but also at the organ and whole-plant levels, including stomatal 
      regulation, and hypersensitive and systemic responses to prevent or reduce the 
      spread of stress impacts within the plant. Defence can also take place at the 
      ecosystem level by root exudation of signalling molecules and the emission of 
      volatile organic compounds, either directly or indirectly into the rhizosphere 
      and/or the aboveground atmosphere. The mechanisms by which plants control the 
      production of these compounds and that mediate perception of stressful conditions 
      are still not fully understood. Here we summarise plant defence strategies from 
      the cellular to ecosystem level, discuss their advantages and disadvantages for 
      plant growth and development, elucidate the current state of research on the 
      transport and regeneration capacity of defence metabolites, and outline 
      insufficiently explored questions for further investigation.

AB  - Exploring keystone taxa affecting microbial community stability and host function 
      is crucial for understanding ecosystem functions. However, identifying keystone 
      taxa from humongous microbial communities remains challenging. We collected 344 
      rhizosphere and bulk soil samples from the endangered plant C. migao for 2 years 
      consecutively. Used high-throughput sequencing 16S rDNA and ITS to obtain the 
      composition of bacterial and fungal communities. We explored keystone taxa and 
      the applicability and limitations of five methods (SPEC-OCCU, Zi-Pi, Subnetwork, 
      Betweenness, and Module), as well as the impact of microbial community domain, 
      time series, and rhizosphere boundary on the identification of keystone taxa in 
      the communities. Our results showed that the five methods, identified abundant 
      keystone taxa in rhizosphere and bulk soil microbial communities. However, the 
      keystone taxa shared by the rhizosphere and bulk soil microbial communities over 
      time decreased rapidly decrease in the five methods. Among five methods on the 
      identification of keystone taxa in the rhizosphere community, Module identified 
      113 taxa, SPEC-OCCU identified 17 taxa, Betweenness identified 3 taxa, Subnetwork 
      identified 3 taxa, and Zi-Pi identified 4 taxa. The keystone taxa are mainly 
      conditionally rare taxa, and their ecological functions include 
      chemoheterotrophy, aerobic chemoheterotrophy, nitrate reduction, and anaerobic 
      photoautotrophy. The results of the random forest model and structural equation 
      model predict that keystone taxa Mortierella and Ellin6513 may have an effects on 
      the accumulation of 1, 4, 7, - Cycloundecatriene, 1, 5, 9, 9-tetramethyl-, Z, Z, 
      Z-, beta-copaene, bicyclogermacrene, 1,8-Cineole in C. migao fruits, but their 
      effects still need further evidence. Our study evidence an unstable microbial 
      community in the bulk soil, and the definition of microbial boundary and 
      ecologically functional affected the identification of keystone taxa in the 
      community. Subnetwork and Module are more in line with the definition of keystone 
      taxa in microbial ecosystems in terms of maintaining community stability and 
      hosting function.

AB  - Forest ecosystems worldwide currently face worrying episodes of forest decline, 
      which have boosted weakening and mortality of the trees. In the Mediterranean 
      region, especially in the southeast Iberian Peninsula, Pinus sylvestris forests 
      are severely affected by this phenomenon, and it has been commonly attributed to 
      drought events. Remarkably, the role of root microbiota on pine decline has been 
      overlooked and remains unclear. We therefore used metabarcoding to identify the 
      belowground microbial communities of decline-affected and unaffected pine trees. 
      Taxonomic composition of bacterial and fungal rhizosphere communities, and fungal 
      populations dwelling in root endosphere showed different profiles depending on 
      the health status of the trees. The root endosphere of asymptomatic trees was as 
      strongly dominated by 'Candidatus Phytoplasma pini' as the root of 
      decline-affected pines, accounting for >99 % of the total bacterial sequences in 
      some samples. Notwithstanding, the titer of this phytopathogen was four-fold 
      higher in symptomatic trees than in symptomless ones. Furthermore, the microbiota 
      inhabiting the root endosphere of decline-affected trees assembled into a less 
      complex and more modularized network. Thus, the observed changes in the microbial 
      communities could be a cause or a consequence of forest decline phenomenon. 
      Moreover, 'Ca. Phytoplasma pini' is positively correlated to Pinus sylvestris 
      decline events, either as the primary cause of pine decline or as an 
      opportunistic pathogen exacerbating the process once the tree has been weaken by 
      other factors.

TI  - Responses of vascular plant fine roots and associated microbial communities to 
      whole-ecosystem warming and elevated CO(2) in northern peatlands.
PG  - 1333-1347

AB  - Warming and elevated CO(2) (eCO(2)) are expected to facilitate vascular plant 
      encroachment in peatlands. The rhizosphere, where microbial activity is fueled by 
      root turnover and exudates, plays a crucial role in biogeochemical cycling, and 
      will likely at least partially dictate the response of the belowground carbon 
      cycle to climate changes. We leveraged the Spruce and Peatland Responses Under 
      Changing Environments (SPRUCE) experiment, to explore the effects of a 
      whole-ecosystem warming gradient (+0 degrees C to 9 degrees C) and eCO(2) on vascular plant fine 
      roots and their associated microbes. We combined trait-based approaches with the 
      profiling of fungal and prokaryote communities in plant roots and rhizospheres, 
      through amplicon sequencing. Warming promoted self-reliance for resource uptake 
      in trees and shrubs, while saprophytic fungi and putative 
      chemoorganoheterotrophic bacteria utilizing plant-derived carbon substrates were 
      favored in the root zone. Conversely, eCO(2) promoted associations between trees 
      and ectomycorrhizal fungi. Trees mostly associated with short-distance 
      exploration-type fungi that preferentially use labile soil N. Additionally, 
      eCO(2) decreased the relative abundance of saprotrophs in tree roots. Our results 
      indicate that plant fine-root trait variation is a crucial mechanism through 
      which vascular plants in peatlands respond to climate change via their influence 
      on microbial communities that regulate biogeochemical cycles.

AB  - The structural and functional characteristics of soil prokaryotic community are 
      important for maintaining ecosystem functions. In this study, we examined the 
      diversity and compositions, the key drivers, as well as functional 
      characteristics of prokaryotic communities in the rhizosphere and non-rhizosphere 
      soils of Picea asperata with different stand ages using high-throughput 
      sequencing technique and bioinformatics methods. The results showed that 
      beta-diversity of soil prokaryotic communities in both rhizosphere and 
      non-rhizosphere showed significant differences among different stand ages, but no 
      significant difference between rhizosphere and non-rhizosphere in the same stand 
      age. In terms of community composition at the phylum level, the relative 
      abundances of Proteobacteria and Rokubacteria showed an increasing trend with the 
      increases of stand age, while the relative abundance of Actinobacteria showed a 
      decreasing trend, but no significant difference was observed between 75 year-old 
      planted forests (PF75) and natural forests (NF). The relative abundances of 
      Firmicutes and Thaumarchaeota in the soil of the 25 year-old planted forests 
      (PF25) were significantly higher than in other planted forests and NF. At the 
      genus level, the relative abundances of RB41, Terrimonas and Acidibacter showed 
      an increasing trend with the increases of stand age, and RB41 and Terrimonas in 
      rhizosphere soil of PF75 were significantly higher than those in NF. Soil 
      properties and vegetation characteristics jointly influenced the structure of 
      soil prokaryotic communities, with herb layer coverage, soil pH, total 
      phosphorus, and total nitrogen as major drivers. The functional characteristics 
      of soil prokaryotic communities were significantly different among different 
      stand ages. The relative abundances of functions involved in carbon and nitrogen 
      cycle, e.g., cellulolysis and nitrification, decreased with the increases of 
      stand age, whereas that of sulfate respiration involved in the sulfur cycle 
      increased. We proposed that the structure and functional characteristics of soil 
      prokaryotic communities could serve as important indicators of the development 
      stages of P. asperata forests. In the later stages of plantation forest 
      development, soil nutrient availability could be improved by mediating 
      phosphorus-dissolving and nitrogen-enhancing microorganisms to maintain the 
      stability of the plantation ecosystem.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Forest medicinal compound systems in agroforestry ecosystems 
      represent a multi-layered cultivation approach that utilizes forest resources 
      efficiently. However, research on how these systems affect soil nutrients and 
      microbial communities is limited. METHODS: This study compared the soil chemical 
      properties and microbial communities of Bletilla striata (C) grown alone versus 
      in agroforestry systems with apple (PB), pear (LB), and peach trees (TB), aiming 
      to understand the impact of these systems on soil health and microbial diversity. 
      RESULTS: Soil in the GAB systems showed increased levels of essential nutrients 
      but lower pH and ammonium nitrogen levels compared to the control. Significant 
      improvements in organic matter, total phosphorus, and total potassium were 
      observed in TB, PB, and LB systems, respectively. The bacterial diversity 
      increased in GAB systems, with significant changes in microbial phyla indicative 
      of a healthier soil ecosystem. The correlation between soil properties and 
      bacterial communities was stronger than with fungal communities. DISCUSSION: 
      Integrating B. striata with fruit trees enhances soil nutrients and microbial 
      diversity but may lead to soil acidification. Adjustments such as using 
      controlled-release fertilizers and soil amendments like lime could mitigate 
      negative impacts, improving soil health in GAB systems.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Rhizosphere microorganisms are influenced by vegetation. Meanwhile, 
      they respond to vegetation through their own changes, developing an interactive 
      feedback system between microorganisms and vegetation. However, it is still 
      unclear whether the functional diversity of rhizosphere soil microorganisms 
      varies with different carbon storage levels and what factors affect the 
      functional diversity of rhizosphere soil microorganisms. METHODS: In this study, 
      the Biolog-Eco microplate technique was used to analyze the metabolic diversity 
      of carbon source of rhizosphere soil microorganisms from 6 Pinus massoniana 
      provenances with three levels of high, medium and low carbon storage. RESULTS: 
      The results showed that the average well color development(AWCD) value of 
      rhizosphere microorganisms was significantly positive correlated with carbon 
      storage level of Pinus massoniana (p < 0.05). The AWCD value, Simpson and Shannon 
      diversity of high carbon sequestrance provenances were 1.40 (144h incubation) 
      0.96 and 3.24, respectively, which were significantly higher (p < 0.05) than 
      those of other P. massoniana provenances. The rhizosphere microbial AWCD, Shannon 
      and Simpson diversity of the 6 provenances showed the same variation trend 
      (SM>AY>QJ>SX>HF>SW). Similarly, microbial biomass carbon (MBC) content was 
      positively correlated with carbon storage level, and there were significant 
      differences among high, medium and low carbon storage provenances. The PCA 
      results showed that the differences in the carbon source metabolism of 
      rhizosphere microorganisms were mainly reflected in the utilization of amino 
      acids, carboxylic acids and carbohydrates. Pearson correlation analysis showed 
      that soil organic carbon (SOC), total nitrogen (TN) and pH were significantly 
      correlated with rhizosphere AWCD (p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Soil properties are 
      important factors affecting rhizosphere microbial carbon source metabolism. The 
      study confirmed that the microorganisms of high carbon storage provenances had 
      relatively high carbon metabolic activity. Among them, the carbon metabolic 
      activity of rhizosphere microorganisms of SM provenance was the highest, which 
      was the preferred provenances in effective ecological service function.

AB  - Brazilian biomes are important sources for environmental microorganisms, 
      including efficient metabolic machineries, like actinomycetes. These bacteria are 
      known for their abilities to produce many bioactive compounds, including enzymes 
      with multiple industrial applications. The present work aimed to evaluate 
      lignocellulolytic abilities of actinomycetes isolated from soil and rhizosphere 
      samples collected at Caatinga, Atlantic and Amazon Forest. Laccase (Lac), lignin 
      peroxidase (LiP), manganese peroxidase (MnP) and cellulase were evaluated for 
      their efficiency. These enzymes have an essential role in lignin decomposition, 
      through oxidation of phenolic and non-phenolic compounds, as well as enzymatic 
      hydrolysis of vegetal biomass. In this sense, a total of 173 actinomycetes were 
      investigated. Eleven (11) of them were selected by their enzymatic performance. 
      The actinomycete AC166 displayed some activity in all analysed scenarios in terms 
      of Lac, MnP and LiP activity, while AC171 was selected as the most promising 
      strain, showing the following activities: 29.7 U.L(-1) for Lac; 2.5 U.L(-1) for 
      LiP and 23 U.L(-1) for MnP. Cellulolytic activities were evaluated at two pH 
      conditions, 4.8 and 7.4, obtaining the following results: 25 U.L(-1) and 71 
      U.L(-1), respectively. Thermostability (4, 30 and 60 (o) C) and salinity 
      concentrations (0 to 4 M) and pH variation (2.0 to 9.0) stabilities of the 
      obtained LiP and Lac enzymatic extracts were also verified. The actinomycete 
      strain AC171 displayed an adaptable response in distinct pH and salt profiles, 
      indicating that bacterial LiP was some halophilic type. Additionally, the strain 
      AC149 produced an alkali and extreme halophilic lignin peroxidase, which are 
      promising profiles for their future application under lignocellulosic biomass at 
      bioethanol biorefineries.

AB  - To investigate the biocatalytic potential of Amazonian actinomycetes for 
      monoterpenes biotransformation. To carry out the present study, eleven 
      actinomycetes of the genus Streptomyces isolated from inga-cipo (Inga edulis 
      Mart.) rhizospheres were tested for their ability to bioconvert the substrates 
      R-(+)-limonene, S-(-)-limonene, 1S-(-)-alpha-pinene, and (-)-beta-pinene as sole carbon 
      and energy source. According to gas chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis, 
      three strains, LabMicra B270, LaBMicrA B310, and LaBMicrA B314, were able to 
      biotransform 1S-(-)-alpha-pinene after 96 h of growth. However, Streptomyces LaBMicrA 
      B270 was the most promising since it converted after only 72 h all the 
      1S-(-)-alpha-pinene mainly into cis-verbenol (74.9+/-1.24%) and verbenone (18.2+/-1.20%), 
      compounds that have important biological activities and great industrial interest 
      as additives in foods and cosmetics. These findings can stimulate the development 
      of natural aromas using naturally abundant monoterpenes, ratify the potential of 
      microorganisms from almost unexplored niches such as the Amazonian rhizosphere, 
      and reinforce the importance of preserving those niches.

AB  - Nitrogen (N) fertilization is crucial for maintaining plant productivity. Clonal 
      plants can share resources between connected ramets through clonal integration 
      influencing microbial communities and regulating soil biogeochemical cycling, 
      especially in the rhizosphere. However, the effect of various N fertilization 
      practices on microbial communities in the rhizosphere of clonal ramets remain 
      unknown. In this study, clonal fragments of Moso bamboo (Phyllostachys edulis), 
      consisting of a parent ramet, an offspring ramet, and an interconnecting rhizome, 
      were established in the field. NH(4)NO(3) solution was applied to the parent, 
      offspring ramets or rhizomes to investigate the effect of fertilization practices 
      on the structure and function of rhizosphere microbial communities. The 
      differences in N availability, microbial biomass and community composition, and 
      abundance of nitrifying genes among rhizosphere soils of ramets gradually 
      decreased during the rapid growth of Moso bamboo, irrespective of fertilization 
      practice. The soil N availability variation, particularly in NO(3)(-), caused by 
      fertilization practices altered the rhizosphere microbial community. Soil N 
      availability and stable microbial biomass N in parent fertilization were the 
      highest, being 9.0 % and 18.7 %, as well as 60.8 % and 90.4 % higher than rhizome 
      and offspring fertilizations, respectively. The microbial network nodes and links 
      in rhizome fertilization were 1.8 and 7.5 times higher than in parent and 
      offspring fertilization, respectively. However, the diversity of bacterial 
      community and abundance of nitrifying and denitrifying genes were the highest in 
      offspring fertilization among three practices, which may be associated with 
      increased N loss. Collectively, the rhizosphere microbial community 
      characteristics depended on fertilization practices by altering the clonal 
      integration of N in Moso bamboo. Parent and rhizome fertilization were favorable 
      for N retention in plant-soil system and resulted in more stable microbial 
      functions than offspring fertilization. Our findings provide new insights into 
      precision fertilization for the sustainable Moso bamboo forest management.

AB  - Graphene has promising applications in agriculture and forestry. In the current 
      study, six different concentrations of graphene (0mg/L, 0.01mg/L, 0.10mg/L, 
      1.00mg/L, 10.00mg/L, and 100.00mg/L) were used to investigate its effect on the 
      growth and development of V. angularis plants in soil culture. The results showed 
      that the group treated with 1.00mg/L graphene (G-1) had significantly increased 
      plant height (19.86%), stem diameter (24.33%), and leaf area (13.69%), compared 
      to the control group (CK). Moreover, all concentrations of graphene had positive 
      effects on the total root length, total root surface area, and the number of root 
      tips of V. angularis. Compared to the CK group, the G-1 group had significantly 
      increased leaf water potential (37.89%), leaf conductivity (2.25%), and SOD, POD, 
      and CAT activities (47.67%, 35.22%, and 199.3%, respectively). The G-1 group also 
      showed improved leaf net photosynthetic rate, chlorophyll content, and soluble 
      sugar content (51.28%, 24.25%, and 38.35%, respectively), compared to the CK 
      group. Additionally, 1.00mg/L graphene led to a 23.88% increase in the podding 
      rate and a 17.04% increase in the yield of V. angularis plants. The rhizosphere 
      soil of V. angularis treated with 1.00mg/L graphene had a 25.14% increase in 
      hydrolyzable nitrogen content and a 66.67% increase in available phosphorus 
      content. RNA-seq data indicated that 1.00mg/L graphene induced the expression of 
      photosynthesis and nitrogen transmembrane transport genes, including ATP synthase 
      subunit b, photosystem I reaction center subunit XI, photosystem I reaction 
      center subunit IV A, ferredoxin, and psbP-like protein 1, as well as genes for 
      photosynthesis antenna proteins, glutamine synthetase, glutamate dehydrogenase 1, 
      cyanate hydratase, protein fluG-like, and NRT1/PTR family, suggesting that 
      graphene promoted the growth and development of V. angularis by enhancing the 
      photosynthesis and nitrogen metabolism processes in V. angularis plants. Our 
      results indicated that a suitable concentration of graphene could significantly 
      promote the growth of V. angularis plants in soil.

AB  - Constructed wetlands are an efficient and cost-effective method of restoring 
      degraded wetlands, in which the microorganisms present make a significant 
      contribution to the ecosystem. In this study, we comprehensively investigated the 
      patterns of diversity and assembly processes of 7 types of constructed wetlands 
      at the rhizosphere and phyllosphere levels. The results showed that the 
      rhizosphere communities of the constructed wetlands exhibited a more balanced 
      structure than that of paddy fields, and 5 types of constructed wetland 
      demonstrated higher potential diversity than that of paddy fields. However, the 
      opposite trend was observed for the phyllosphere communities. Analysis of mean 
      nearest taxon difference indicated that both deterministic and stochastic 
      processes affected the establishment of the rhizosphere and phyllosphere 
      communities, and stochastic processes may have had a larger effect. An iCAMP 
      model showed that dispersal limitation was the most important factor (67% 
      relative contribution) in the rhizosphere community, while drift was the most 
      important (47% relative contribution) in the phyllosphere community. Mantel tests 
      suggested that sucrase, average height, top height, total biomass, belowground 
      biomass, maximum water-holding capacity, and capillary porosity were 
      significantly correlated with processes in the rhizosphere community, whereas 
      factors such as the deterministic process, average height, top height, and SOC 
      were significantly correlated with deterministic processes in the phyllosphere 
      community. Our results can assist in the evaluation of artificial restorations, 
      and can provide understanding of the ecological processes of microbial 
      communities, as well as new insights into the manipulation of microorganisms in 
      polluted wetland ecosystems.

      diversity, structure, and network.

AB  - Teak is a precious hardwood species in tropical and subtropical regions with a 
      long growth cycle and slow economic returns. Intercropping medicinal plants is an 
      effective method for obtaining early returns during the growth period of teak. 
      However, currently, we lack sufficient knowledge about the impact of 
      intercropping on the soil microenvironment, especially on rhizosphere soil 
      bacterial communities. We selected two medicinal plants Alpinia katsumadai Hayata 
      and Amomum longiligulare T.L. Wu, for an intercropping experiment with teak, and 
      the non-intercropping teak forest area was used for comparison. By collecting 
      soil rhizosphere samples and conducting 16S rDNA sequencing and property 
      analysis, we aimed to investigate the influence of teak intercropping on soil 
      microbial communities. The results showed that intercropping significantly 
      improved soil nutrients contents, such as soil organic matter, soil total 
      potassium and soil available nitrogen, and significantly altered bacterial 
      community structure. Co-occurrence network analysis revealed that intercropping 
      tightened the connections of the soil bacterial network and increased its 
      complexity (by increasing the number of nodes and the proportion of positive 
      edges). Teak intercropping with Amomum longiligulare T.L. Wu resulted in tighter 
      network connections than teak intercropping with A. katsumadai Hayata. Changes in 
      the soil bacterial community structure may related to environmental factors such 
      as total potassium content and pH. These results demonstrated that the 
      introduction of medicinal plants exerts a significant impact on the soil 
      bacterial community of teak, fostering the enrichment of specific bacterial taxa 
      (such as Firmicutes and Methylomirabilota), and makes the rhizosphere bacterial 
      network denser and more complex. This study provides valuable insights for the 
      management of teak plantations.

TI  - Drought resistance and resilience of rhizosphere communities in forest soils from 
      the cellular to ecosystem scale - insights from (13)C pulse labeling.
PG  - 960-974
LID - 10.1111/nph.19612 [doi]
AB  - The link between above- and belowground communities is a key uncertainty in 
      drought and rewetting effects on forest carbon (C) cycle. In young beech model 
      ecosystems and mature naturally dry pine forest exposed to 15-yr-long irrigation, 
      we performed (13)C pulse labeling experiments, one during drought and one 2 wk 
      after rewetting, tracing tree assimilates into rhizosphere communities. The (13)C 
      pulses applied in tree crowns reached soil microbial communities of the young and 
      mature forests one and 4 d later, respectively. Drought decreased the transfer of 
      labeled assimilates relative to the irrigation treatment. The (13)C label in 
      phospholipid fatty acids (PLFAs) indicated greater drought reduction of 
      assimilate incorporation by fungi (-85%) than by gram-positive (-43%) and 
      gram-negative bacteria (-58%). (13)C label incorporation was more strongly 
      reduced for PLFAs (cell membrane) than for microbial cytoplasm extracted by 
      chloroform. This suggests that fresh rhizodeposits are predominantly used for 
      osmoregulation or storage under drought, at the expense of new cell formation. 
      Two weeks after rewetting, (13)C enrichment in PLFAs was greater in previously 
      dry than in continuously moist soils. Drought and rewetting effects were greater 
      in beech systems than in pine forest. Belowground C allocation and rhizosphere 
      communities are highly resilient to drought.

AB  - Antibiotics are an important pharmaceutical class excessively used by humans. Its 
      presence in the soil can impact plant growth and induce antibiotic resistance. 
      This research studies the effect of sulfamethoxazole (SMX) on plant growth, 
      rhizosphere bacteria composition, and resistance genes. Two sets of vegetables 
      (basil, cilantro, and spinach) were treated separately with water and SMX 
      solution. The plant growth data and soil samples were collected and analyzed. The 
      results revealed that SMX increased spinach leaf length (34.0%) while having no 
      significant impacts on basil and cilantro. On the other hand, SMX improved the 
      bacterial diversity in all samples. The shifts in the abundance of plant 
      growth-promoting bacteria could indirectly affect vegetable stem and leaf length. 
      SMX also significantly increased the abundance of resistance genes Sul1 and Sul2. 
      A further study into the correlation between bacteria highlights the importance 
      of Shingomonas and Alfipia for inhibiting the spread of key resistance gene 
      hosts, namely, Pseudomonas, Stenotrophomonas, and Agrobacterium. This research 
      provides insight into SMX's impact on vegetable growth and microbial diversity. 
      It also points out important microbial interactions that could potentially be 
      utilized to mitigate ARG proliferation.

TI  - Rice receptor kinase FLR7 regulates rhizosphere oxygen levels and enriches the 
      dominant Anaeromyxobacter that improves submergence tolerance in rice.

AB  - Oxygen is one of the determinants of root microbiome formation. However, whether 
      plants regulate rhizosphere oxygen levels to affect microbiota composition and 
      the underlying molecular mechanisms remain elusive. The receptor-like kinase 
      (RLK) family member FERONIA modulates the growth-defense tradeoff in Arabidopsis. 
      Here, we established that rice FERONIA-like RLK 7 (FLR7) controls rhizosphere 
      oxygen levels by methylene blue staining, oxygen flux, and potential 
      measurements. The formation of oxygen-transporting aerenchyma in roots is 
      negatively regulated by FLR7. We further characterized the root microbiota of 11 
      FLR mutants including flr7 and wild-type Nipponbare (Nip) grown in the field by 
      16S ribosomal RNA gene profiling and demonstrated that the 11 FLRs are involved 
      in regulating rice root microbiome formation. The most abundant 
      anaerobic-dependent genus Anaeromyxobacter in the Nip root microbiota was less 
      abundant in the root microbiota of all these mutants, and this contributed the 
      most to the community differences between most mutants and Nip. Metagenomic 
      sequencing revealed that flr7 increases aerobic respiration and decreases 
      anaerobic respiration in the root microbiome. Finally, we showed that a 
      representative Anaeromyxobacter strain improved submergence tolerance in rice via 
      FLR7. Collectively, our findings indicate that FLR7 mediates changes in 
      rhizosphere oxygen levels and enriches the beneficial dominant genus 
      Anaeromyxobacter and may provide insights for developing plant flood prevention 
      strategies via the use of environment-specific functional soil microorganisms.

AB  - The Amazon rainforest, a hotspot for biodiversity, is a crucial research area for 
      scientists seeking novel microorganisms with ecological and biotechnological 
      significance. A key region within the Amazon rainforest is the Amazonian Dark 
      Earths (ADE), noted for supporting diverse plant and microbial communities, and 
      its potential as a blueprint for sustainable agriculture. This study delineates 
      the isolation, morphological traits, carbon source utilization, and genomic 
      features of Fictibacillus terranigra CENA-BCM004, a candidate novel species of 
      the Fictibacillus genus isolated from ADE. The genome of Fictibacillus terranigra 
      was sequenced, resulting in 16 assembled contigs, a total length of 4,967,627 bp, 
      and a GC content of 43.65%. Genome annotation uncovered 3315 predicted genes, 
      encompassing a wide range of genes linked to various metabolic pathways. 
      Phylogenetic analysis indicated that CENA-BCM004 is a putative new species, 
      closely affiliated with other unidentified Fictibacillus species and Bacillus sp. 
      WQ 8-8. Moreover, this strain showcased a multifaceted metabolic profile, 
      revealing its potential for diverse biotechnological applications. It exhibited 
      capabilities to antagonize pathogens, metabolize multiple sugars, mineralize 
      organic matter compounds, and solubilize several minerals. These insights 
      substantially augment our comprehension of microbial diversity in ADE and 
      underscore the potential of Fictibacillus terranigra as a precious resource for 
      biotechnological endeavors. The genomic data generated from this study will serve 
      as a foundational resource for subsequent research and exploration of the 
      biotechnological capabilities of this newly identified species.

AB  - The chemical properties of bedrock play a crucial role in shaping the communities 
      of soil and root-associated arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF). We investigate 
      AMF community composition and diversity in bulk soil, rhizosphere soil, and roots 
      in karst and non-karst forests. Chemical properties of bedrock of the calcium 
      oxide (CaO) and ratio of calcium oxide and magnesium oxide (Ca/Mg), soil pH, and 
      exchangeable Ca(2+) were higher in karst carbonate rocks compared to non-karst 
      clastic rocks. Conversely, bedrock phosphorus content (P-rock), silicon dioxide 
      (SiO(2)) content, and tree diversity exhibited an opposing trend. AMF abundance 
      was higher in non-karst clastic rocks than in karst carbonate rocks. Stronger 
      interspecific interactions among AMF taxa occurred in the bulk soil and 
      rhizosphere soil of non-karst clastic rocks compared to karst carbonate rocks. 
      AMF abundance and diversity were higher in rhizosphere soil and roots, attributed 
      to increasing nutrient availability when compared to the bulk soil. A more 
      complex network within AMF taxa was observed in rhizosphere soil and roots 
      compared to bulk soil due to an increase in AMF abundance and diversity in 
      rhizosphere soil and roots. Comparing non-karst clastic rocks, karst carbonate 
      rocks increased soil nitrogen (N) and P levels, which can be attributed to the 
      elevated content of soil Ca(2+) and Mg(2+) content, facilitated by the high CaO 
      content and Ca/Mg ratio in the bedrock of karst forests. However, the thicker 
      soil layer exhibited higher soil nutrient storage, resulting in greater tree 
      diversity in non-karst forests. These findings suggest that high tree richness 
      may increase root biomass and secretion of root exudates in non-karst regions, 
      thereby enhancing the abundance of AMF and their interspecies interactions. 
      Consequently, the diverse bedrock properties that drive variations in soil 
      properties, nutrients, and plant diversity can impact AMF communities, ultimately 
      promoting plant growth and contributing to vegetation recovery.

AB  - Plants produce a diverse array of toxic compounds which may be released by 
      precipitation, explaining their wide occurrence in surrounding soil and water. 
      This study presents the first mechanistic model for describing the generation and 
      environmental fate of a natural toxin, i.e. ptaquiloside (PTA), a carcinogenic 
      phytotoxin produced by bracken fern (Pteridium aquilinum L. Kuhn). The newly 
      adapted DAISY model was calibrated based on two-year monitoring performed in the 
      period 2018-2019 in a Danish bracken population located in a forest glade. 
      Several functions related to the fate of PTA were calibrated, covering processes 
      from toxin generation in the canopy, wash off by precipitation and degradation in 
      the soil. Model results show a good description of observed bracken biomass and 
      PTA contents, supporting the assumption that toxin production can be explained by 
      the production of new biomass. Model results show that only 4.4 % of the PTA 
      produced in bracken is washed off by precipitation, from both canopy and litter. 
      Model simulations showed that PTA degrades rapidly once in the soil, especially 
      during summer due to the high soil temperatures. Leaching takes place in form of 
      pulses directly connected to precipitation events, with maximum simulated 
      concentrations up to 4.39 mug L(-1) at 50 cm depth. Macropore transport is mainly 
      responsible for the events with the highest PTA concentrations, contributing to 
      72 % of the total mass of PTA leached. Based on the results, we identify areas 
      with high density of bracken, high precipitation during the summer and soils 
      characterized by fast transport, as the most vulnerable to surface and 
      groundwater pollution by phytotoxins.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Plant Ni uptake in aboveground biomass exceeding 
      concentrations of 1000 mug g(-1) in dry weight is defined as Ni hyperaccumulation. 
      Whether hyperaccumulators are capable of mobilizing larger Ni pools than 
      non-accumulators is still debated and rhizosphere processes are still largely 
      unknown. The aim of this study was to investigate rhizosphere processes and 
      possible Ni mobilization by the Ni hyperaccumulator Odontarrhena chalcidica and 
      to test Ni uptake in relation to a soil Ni gradient. METHODS: The Ni 
      hyperaccumulator O. chalcidica was grown in a pot experiment on six soils showing 
      a pseudo-total Ni and labile (DTPA-extractable) Ni gradient and on an additional 
      soil showing high pseudo-total but low labile Ni. Soil pore water was sampled to 
      monitor changes in soil solution ionome, pH, and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) 
      along the experiment. RESULTS: Results showed that Ni and Fe concentrations, pH 
      as well as DOC concentrations in pore water were significantly increased by O. 
      chalcidica compared to unplanted soils. A positive correlation between Ni in 
      shoots and pseudo-total concentrations and pH in soil was observed, although 
      plant Ni concentrations did not clearly show the same linear pattern with soil 
      available Ni. CONCLUSIONS: This study shows a clear root-induced Ni and Fe 
      mobilization in the rhizosphere of O. chalcidica and suggests a rhizosphere 
      mechanism based on soil alkalinization and exudation of organic ligands. 
      Furthermore, it was demonstrated that soil pH and pseudo-total Ni are better 
      predictors of Ni plant uptake in O. chalcidica than labile soil Ni. SUPPLEMENTARY

      contaminated agricultural soil: Dynamic responses of functional genes and 
      microbial community.

AB  - A biochar-intensified phytoremediation experiment was designed to investigate the 
      dynamic effects of different biochars on polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) 
      removal in ryegrass rhizosphere contaminated soil. Maize and wheat straw biochar 
      pyrolyzed at 300  degrees C and 500  degrees C were amended into PAH-contaminated soil, and then 
      ryegrass (Lolium multiflorum L.) was planted for 90 days. Spearman's correlations 
      among PAH removal, enzyme activity, abundance of PAH-ring hydroxylating 
      dioxygenase (PAH-RHDalpha), and fungal and bacterial community structure were 
      analyzed to elucidate the microbial degradation mechanisms during the combined 
      remediation process. The results showed that 500  degrees C wheat straw biochar had 
      higher surface area and more nutrients, and significantly accelerated the 
      phytoremediation of PAHs (62.5 %), especially for high molecular weight PAH in 
      contaminated soil. The activities of urease and dehydrogenase and the abundance 
      of total and PAH-degrading bacteria, which improved with time by biochar and 
      ryegrass, had a positive correlation with the removal rate of PAHs. Biochar 
      enhanced the abundance of gram-negative (GN) PAH-RHDalpha genes. The GN 
      PAH-degraders, Sphingomonas, bacteriap25, Haliangium, and Dongia may play vital 
      roles in PAH degradation in biochar-amended rhizosphere soils. Principal 
      coordinate analysis indicated that biochar led to significant differences in 
      fungal community structures before 30 days, while the diversity of the bacterial 
      community composition depended on planting ryegrass after 60 days. These findings 
      imply that the structural reshaping of microbial communities results from 
      incubation time and the selection of biochar and ryegrass in PAH-contaminated 
      soils. Applying 500  degrees C wheat straw biochar could enhance the rhizoremediation of 
      PAH-contaminated soil and benefit the soil microbial ecology.

AB  - In order to evaluate the feasibility of rice husk and rice husk biochar on 
      assisting phytoremediation of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and heavy 
      metals (HMs) co-contaminated soils, a 150-day pot experiment planted with alfalfa 
      was designed. Rice husk and its derived biochar were applied to remediate a PAHs, 
      Zn, and Cr co-contaminated soil. The effects of rice husk and biochar on the 
      removal and bioavailability of PAHs and HMs, PAH-ring hydroxylating dioxygenase 
      gene abundance and bacterial community structure in rhizosphere soils were 
      investigated. Results suggested that rice husk biochar had better performance on 
      the removal of PAHs and immobilization of HMs than those of rice husk in 
      co-contaminated rhizosphere soil. The abundance of PAH-degraders, which increased 
      with the culture time, was positively correlated with PAHs removal. Rice husk 
      biochar decreased the richness and diversity of bacterial community, enhanced the 
      growth of Steroidobacter, Bacillus, and Sphingomonas in rhizosphere soils. 
      However, Steroidobacter, Dongia and Acidibacter were stimulated in rice husk 
      amended soils. According to the correlation analysis, Steroidobacter and 
      Mycobacterium may play an important role in PAHs removal and HMs absorption. The 
      combination of rice husk biochar and alfalfa would be a promising method to 
      remediate PAHs and HMs co-contaminated soil.

AB  - Mangroves are of important economic and environmental value and research suggests 
      that their carbon sequestration and climate change mitigation potential is 
      significantly larger than other forests. However, increasing salinity and heavy 
      metal pollution significantly affect mangrove ecosystem function and 
      productivity. This study investigates the tolerance mechanisms of rhizobacteria 
      in the rhizosphere of Avicennia marina under salinity and copper (Cu) stress 
      during a 4-y stress period. The results exhibited significant differences in 
      antioxidant levels, transcripts, and secondary metabolites. Under salt stress, 
      the differentially expressed metabolites consisted of 30% organic acids, 26.78% 
      nucleotides, 16.67% organic heterocyclic compounds, and 10% organic oxides as 
      opposed to 27.27% organic acids, 24.24% nucleotides, 15.15% organic heterocyclic 
      compounds, and 12.12% phenyl propane and polyketides under Cu stress. This 
      resulted in differential regulation of metabolic pathways, with phenylpropanoid 
      biosynthesis being unique to Cu stress and alanine/aspartate/glutamate metabolism 
      and alpha-linolenic acid metabolism being unique to salt stress. The regulation of 
      metabolic pathways enhanced antioxidant defenses, nutrient recycling, 
      accumulation of osmoprotectants, stability of plasma membrane, and chelation of 
      Cu, thereby improving the stress tolerance of rhizobacteria and A. marina. Even 
      though the abundance and community structure of rhizobacteria were significantly 
      changed, all the samples were dominated by Proteobacteria, Chloroflexi, 
      Actinobacteriota, and Firmicutes. Since the response mechanisms were unbalanced 
      between treatments, this led to differential growth trends for A. marina. Our 
      study provides valuable inside on variations in diversity and composition of 
      bacterial community structure from mangrove rhizosphere subjected to long-term 
      salt and Cu stress. It also clarifies rhizobacterial adaptive mechanisms to these 
      stresses and how they are important for mitigating abiotic stress and promoting 
      plant growth. Therefore, this study can serve as a reference for future research 
      aimed at developing long-term management practices for mangrove forests.

AB  - Plant-fungal interactions are ubiquitous across ecosystems and contribute 
      significantly to plant ecology and evolution. All orchids form obligate symbiotic 
      relationships with specific fungi for germination and early growth, and the 
      distribution of terrestrial orchid species has been linked to occurrence and 
      abundance of specific orchid mycorrhizal fungi (OMF) in the soil. The 
      availability of OMF can therefore be a habitat requirement that is relevant to 
      consider when establishing management and conservation strategies for threatened 
      orchid species, but knowledge on the spatial distribution of OMF in soil is 
      limited. We here studied the mycorrhizal associations of three terrestrial orchid 
      species (Anacamptis pyramidalis, Orchis purpurea and Platanthera chlorantha) 
      found in a local orchid diversity hotspot in eastern Denmark, and investigated 
      the abundance of the identified mycorrhizal fungi in the surrounding soil. We 
      applied ITS metabarcoding to samples of orchid roots, rhizosphere soil and bulk 
      soil collected at three localities, supplemented with standard barcoding of root 
      samples with OMF specific primers, and detected 22 Operational Taxonomic Units 
      (OTUs) putatively identified as OMF. The three orchid species displayed different 
      patterns of OMF associations, supporting the theory that association with 
      specific fungi constitutes part of an orchid's ecological niche allowing 
      co-occurrence of many species in orchid-rich habitats. The identified mycorrhizal 
      partners in the basidiomycete families Tulasnellaceae and Ceratobasidiaceae 
      (Cantharallales) were detected in low abundance in rhizosphere soil, and appeared 
      almost absent from bulk soil at the localities. This finding highlights our 
      limited knowledge of the ecology and trophic mode of OMF outside orchid tissues, 
      as well as challenges in the detection of specific OMF with standard methods. 
      Potential implications for management and conservation strategies are discussed.

AB  - The efficacy of using plants to phytoremediate heavy metal (HM) contaminated 
      soils can be improved using soil amendments. These amendments may both increase 
      plant biomasses and HMs uptake. We aimed to determine the composite effect of 
      ammonium sulfate ((NH(4))(2)SO(4)) combined with the application of an aqueous 
      stem-extracted bio-chelator (Bidens tripartita L) on the plant biomasses and 
      cadmium (Cd) phytoextraction by Solanum nigrum L. The constant (NH(4))(2)SO(4) 
      application mode plus bio-chelator additives collectively enhanced the shoot Cd 
      extraction ability owing to the increased plant biomass and shoot Cd 
      concentration by S. nigrum. The shoot Cd extraction and the soil Cd decreased 
      concentration confirmed the optimal Cd phytoextraction pattern in K8 and K9 
      treatments (co-application of (NH(4))(2)SO(4) and twofold/threefold 
      bio-chelators). Accordingly, Cd contamination risk in the soil (2 mg kg(-1)) 
      could be completely eradicated (<0.2 mg kg(-1)) after three rounds of 
      phytoremediation by S.nigrum based on K8 and K9 treatments through calculating 
      soil Cd depletion. The microorganism counts and enzyme activities in rhizosphere 
      soils at treatments with the combined soil additives apparently advanced. In 
      general, co-application mode of (NH(4))(2)SO(4) and aqueous bio-chelator was 
      likely to be a perfect substitute for conventional scavenger agents on account of 
      its environmental friendliness and cost saving for field Cd contamination 
      phytoremediation by S. nigrum.

TI  - Trade-off in the partitioning of recent photosynthate carbon under global change.
PG  - e17110
LID - 10.1111/gcb.17110 [doi]
AB  - There may be trade-offs in the allocation patterns of recent photosynthetic 
      carbon (RPC) allocation in response to environmental changes, with a greater 
      proportion of RPC being directed towards compartments experiencing limited 
      resource availability. Alternatively, the allocation of RPC could shift from 
      sources to sinks as plants processing excess photosynthates. It prompts the 
      question: Does the pattern of RPC allocation vary under global changes? If so, is 
      this variation driven by optimal or by residual C allocation strategies? We 
      conducted a meta-analysis by complicating 273 pairwise observations from 55 
      articles with (13) C or (14) C pulse or continuous labeling to assess the 
      partitioning of RPC in biomass (leaf, stem, shoot, and root), soil pools (soil 
      organic C, rhizosphere, and microbial biomass C) and CO(2) fluxes under elevated 
      CO(2) (eCO(2) ), warming, drought and nitrogen (N) addition. We propose that the 
      increased allocation of RPC to belowground under sufficient CO(2) results from 
      the excretion of excess photosynthates. Warming led to a significant reduction in 
      the percentage of RPC allocated to shoots, alongside an increase in roots 
      allocation, although this was not statistically significant. This pattern is due 
      to the reduced water availability resulting from warming. In conditions of 
      drought, there was a notable increase in the partitioning of RPC to stems 
      (+7.25%) and roots (+36.38%), indicative of a greater investment of RPC in roots 
      for accessing water from deeper soil. Additionally, N addition led to a 
      heightened allocation of RPC in leaves (+10.18%) and shoots (+5.78%), while 
      reducing its partitioning in soil organic C (-8.92%). Contrary to the residual C 
      partitioning observed under eCO(2) , the alterations in RPC partitioning in 
      response to warming, drought, and N supplementation are more comprehensively 
      explained through the lens of optimal partitioning theory, showing a trade-off in 
      the partitioning of RPC under global change.

AB  - Pest feeding affects the rhizobacteria community. The rhizomicrobiota activates 
      salicylic acid and jasmonic acid signaling pathways to help plants deal with pest 
      infestation. However, whether plants can recruit special pesticidal 
      microorganisms to deal with attack from herbivores is unclear. A system composed 
      of peanuts and first-instar larvae of Holotrichia parallela were used to analyze 
      whether peanuts truly enrich the insecticidal bacteria after feeding by larvae, 
      and whether inoculation of the enriched bacteria promotes the resistance of 
      plants to herbivore. In this study, high-throughput sequencing of 16 S rRNA gene 
      amplicons was used to demonstrate that infestation of the subterranean pest H. 
      parallela quickly changed the rhizosphere bacterial community structure within 
      24 h, and the abundance of Enterobacteriaceae, especially Enterobacter, was 
      manifestly enriched. Root feeding induced rhizobacteria to form a more complex 
      co-occurrence network than the control. Rhizosphere bacteria were isolated, and 4 
      isolates with high toxicity against H. parallela larvae were obtained by random 
      forest analysis. In a back-inoculation experiment using a split-root system, 
      green fluorescent protein (GFP)-labeled Enterobacter sp. IPPBiotE33 was observed 
      to be enriched in uneaten peanut roots. Additionally, supplementation with 
      IPPBiotE33 alleviated the adverse effects of H. parallela on peanuts. Our 
      findings indicated that herbivore infestation could induce plants to assemble 
      bacteria with specific larvicidal activity to address threats.

AB  - Metal contamination from mine waste is a widespread threat to soil health. 
      Understanding of the effects of toxic metals from mine waste on the spatial 
      patterning of rhizosphere enzymes and the rhizosphere microbiome remains elusive. 
      Using zymography and high-throughput sequencing, we conducted a mesocosm 
      experiment with mine-contaminated soil, to compare the effects of different 
      concentrations of toxic metals on exoenzyme kinetics, microbial communities, and 
      maize growth. The negative effects of toxic metals exerted their effects largely 
      on enzymatic hotspots in the rhizosphere zone, affecting both resistance and the 
      area of hotspots. This study thus revealed the key importance of such hotspots in 
      overall changes in soil enzymatic activity under metal toxicity. Statistical and 
      functional guild analysis suggested that these enzymatic changes and associated 
      microbial community changes were involved in the inhibition of maize growth. 
      Keystone species of bacteria displayed negative correlations with toxic metals 
      and positive correlations with the activity of enzymatic hotspots, suggesting a 
      potential role. This study contributes to an emerging paradigm, that changes both 
      in the activity of soil enzymes and soil biota - whether due to substrate 
      addition or in this case toxicity - are largely confined to enzymatic hotspot 
      areas.

TI  - Influence of Organic and Inorganic Fertilizers on Tea Growth and Quality and Soil 
      Properties of Tea Orchards' Top Rhizosphere Soil.
LID - 10.3390/plants13020207 [doi]
LID - 207
AB  - Organic-based fertilizers have been ratified to be effective in ameliorating tea 
      growth and the fertility of soil. However, the effect of integrated fertilization 
      on tea growth and quality and the chemical properties of the soil in tea gardens 
      are unclear. To address this, from 2020 to 2021, five different treatments were 
      carried out in the greenhouse of the Tea Research Institute, Hangzhou, CAAS, 
      including CK (control), NPK (chemical fertilizers), RC (rapeseed cake), NPK+B 
      (chemical fertilizer + biochar), and NPK+RC, to investigate the effects of 
      different fertilizations on soil chemistry and tea growth and quality. The 
      results indicated that NPK+B and NPK+RC significantly improved the different 
      amino acid and catechin concentrations in the young shoots, stems, and roots of 
      the tea compared to the CK. The plant growth parameters, e.g., the plant height, 
      no. of leaves, mid-stem girth, and fresh weights of stems and leaves, were 
      significantly increased with integrated fertilization (NPK+B and NPK+RC) compared 
      to the CK and solo organic and inorganic fertilizers. The chlorophyll contents 
      (Chl a, Chl b, and Chl a+b) were generally higher with NPK+RC than with the CK 
      (37%, 35%, and 36%), RC (14%, 26%, and 18%), and NPK (9%, 13%, and 11%) 
      treatments. Integrated fertilization buffered the acidic soil of the tea garden 
      and decreased the soil C:N ratio. NPK+RC also significantly increased the soil's 
      total C (31% and 16%), N (43% and 31%), P (65% and 40%), available P (31% and 
      58%), K (70% and 25%), nitrate (504% and 188%), and ammonium (267% and 146%) 
      concentrations compared to the CK and RC. The soil macro- (Mg and Ca) and 
      micronutrients (Mn, Fe, Zn, and Cu) were significantly improved by the RC (100% 
      and 72%) (49%, 161%, 112%, and 40%) and NPK+RC (88% and 48%) (47%, 75%, 45%, and 
      14%) compared to the CK. The chlorophyll contents and soil macro- and 
      micronutrients were all significantly positively correlated with tea quality 
      (amino acids and catechin contents) and growth. These results indicated that 
      integrated fertilization improved the soil nutrient status, which is associated 
      with the improvement of tea growth and quality. Thus, integrated nutrient 
      management is a feasible tool for improving tea growth, quality, and low nutrient 
      levels in the soil.

TI  - Juvenile Plant-Microbe Interactions Modulate the Adaptation and Response of 
      Forest Seedlings to Rapid Climate Change.
LID - 10.3390/plants13020175 [doi]
LID - 175
AB  - The negative impacts of climate change on native forest ecosystems have created 
      challenging conditions for the sustainability of natural forest regeneration. 
      These challenges arise primarily from abiotic stresses that affect the early 
      stages of forest tree development. While there is extensive evidence on the 
      diversity of juvenile microbial symbioses in agricultural and fruit crops, there 
      is a notable lack of reports on native forest plants. This review aims to 
      summarize the critical studies conducted on the diversity of juvenile 
      plant-microbe interactions in forest plants and to highlight the main benefits of 
      beneficial microorganisms in overcoming environmental stresses such as drought, 
      high and low temperatures, metal(loid) toxicity, nutrient deficiency, and 
      salinity. The reviewed studies have consistently demonstrated the positive 
      effects of juvenile plant-microbiota interactions and have highlighted the 
      potential beneficial attributes to improve plantlet development. In addition, 
      this review discusses the beneficial attributes of managing juvenile 
      plant-microbiota symbiosis in the context of native forest restoration, including 
      its impact on plant responses to phytopathogens, promotion of nutrient uptake, 
      facilitation of seedling adaptation, resource exchange through shared hyphal 
      networks, stimulation of native soil microbial communities, and modulation of 
      gene and protein expression to enhance adaptation to adverse environmental 
      conditions.

AB  - Mediterranean forest ecosystems will be increasingly affected by hotter drought 
      and more frequent and severe wildfire events in the future. However, little is 
      known about the longer-term responses of these forests to multiple disturbances 
      and the forests' capacity to maintain ecosystem function. This is particularly so 
      for below-ground organisms, which have received less attention than those 
      above-ground, despite their essential contributions to forest function. We 
      investigated rhizosphere microbial communities in a resprouting Eucalyptus 
      marginata forest, southwestern Australia, that had experienced a severe wildfire 
      four years previously, and a hotter drought eight years previously. Our aim was 
      to understand how microbial communities are affected over longer-term 
      trajectories by hotter drought and wildfire, singularly, and in combination. 
      Fungal and bacterial DNA was extracted from soil samples, amplified, and 
      subjected to high throughput sequencing. Richness, diversity, composition, and 
      putative functional groups were then examined. We found a monotonic decrease in 
      fungal, but not bacterial, richness and diversity with increasing disturbance 
      with the greatest changes resulting from the combination of drought and wildfire. 
      Overall fungal and bacterial community composition reflected a stronger effect of 
      fire than drought, but the combination of both produced the greatest number of 
      indicator taxa for fungi, and a significant negative effect on the abundance of 
      several fungal functional groups. Key mycorrhizal fungi, fungal saprotrophs and 
      fungal pathogens were found at lower proportions in sites affected by drought 
      plus wildfire. Wildfire had a positive effect on bacterial hydrogen and bacterial 
      nitrogen recyclers. Fungal community composition was positively correlated with 
      live tree height. These results suggest that microbial communities, in particular 
      key fungal functional groups, are highly responsive to wildfire following 
      drought. Thus, a legacy of past climate conditions such as hotter drought can be 
      important for mediating the responses of soil microbial communities to subsequent 
      disturbance like wildfire.

      A pot experiment under field condition.

AB  - Applying selenium (Se) fertilizer is the only way to alleviate soil Se 
      deficiency. Although effects of nanoselenium foliar application on plant growth 
      and stress resistance have been extensively investigated, soil application of 
      nanoselenium on soil microorganisms and their relationship with crop quality and 
      soil health remains unclear. In this study, a steady-state homogeneous 
      nanoparticle of epigallocatechin gallate Se (ESe) was synthesized, and a pot 
      experiment was conducted applying ESe at five concentrations (0, 1, 10, 50, and 
      100 mg kg(-1)) to the tea planattion soil. The study revealed a significant 
      increase in Se concentration in soil and tea with ESe application and identified 
      2.43-7.8 mg kg(-1) as the safe and optimal range for soil application. 
      Specifically, the moderate dose of ESe improved the tea quality [reduced tea 
      polyphenols (TP), increased free amino acids (AA), and reduced TP/AA] and soil 
      quality index (SQI). Besides, in marure tea leaves, antioxidant enzyme activities 
      [promote catalase (CAT) superoxide dismutase (SOD), and peroxidase (POD)] 
      increased, while level of oxidative stress [malondialdehyde (MDA), hydrogen 
      peroxide (H(2)O(2)) and superoxide anion (O(2)(-))] decreased with ESe 
      application. The 16S rRNA of the soil bacteria showed that ESe application 
      significantly changed the community structure of soil bacteria but did not alter 
      the diversity of the bacteria and the abundance of dominant taxa (phylum and 
      genus levels). Statistical analysis of the taxonomic and functional profiles 
      (STAMP) detected 21 differential taxa (genus level), mainly low-abundance ones, 
      under the ESe application. Linear regression and random forest (RF) modeling 
      revealed that the low-abundance bacterial taxa were significantly correlated with 
      SQI (R(2) = 0.28, p < 0.01) and tea quality (R(2) = 0.23-0.37, p < 0.01). Thus, 
      the study's findings suggest that ESe application affects soil and tea quality by 
      modulating the low-abundance taxa in soil. The study also highlights the crucial 
      role of low-abundance bacterial taxa of the rhizosphere in regulating soil 
      functions under the ESe application.

AB  - Terrestrial plants can influence the growth and health of adjacent plants through 
      interspecific interaction. Here, the mechanisms of interspecific plant 
      interaction on microbial function and nutrient utilization in the plant-soil 
      interface (non-rhizosphere soil, rhizosphere soil, and root) were studied by 
      soybean- and potato-poplar intercropping. First, metagenomics showed that 
      soybean- and potato-poplar intercropping influenced the composition and 
      co-occurrence networks of microbial communities in different ecological niches, 
      with higher stability of the microbial community in soybean intercropping. 
      Second, the gene abundance related to carbon metabolism, nitrogen cycling, 
      phosphorus cycling, and sulfur cycling was increased at the poplar-soil interface 
      in soybean intercropping. Moreover, soybean intercropping increased soil nutrient 
      content and enzymatic activity. It showed higher metabolic potential in nutrient 
      metabolism and transportation. Third, functional microorganisms that influenced 
      nutrient cycling and transportation in different intercropping have been 
      identified, namely Acidobacteria, Sphingomonas, Gemmatimonadaceae, 
      Alphaproteobacteria, and Bradyrhizobium. Therefore, intercropping can construct 
      microbial communities to alter metabolic functions and improve nutrient cycling 
      and absorption. Interspecific plant interactions to influence the microbiome were 
      revealed, opening up a new way for the precise regulation of plant 
      microbiome.IMPORTANCEPoplar has the characteristics of wide distribution, strong 
      adaptability, and fast growth, which is an ideal tree species for timber forest. 
      In this study, metagenomics and elemental analysis were used to comprehensively 
      reveal the effects of interspecific plant interactions on microbial communities 
      and functions in different ecological niches. It can provide a theoretical basis 
      for the development and application of the precise management model in poplar.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The purpose of this study was to elucidate the community structure of 
      rhizosphere soil bacteria and endophytic bacteria during the growth of moso 
      bamboo (Phyllostachys edulis) shoots. METHODS: This study collected the 
      rhizospheric soil samples, tissue samples of rhizome roots, shoot buds, winter 
      bamboo shoots, spring bamboo shoots, and samples of forest soil. Their 
      metagenomic DNA was extracted, and the bacterial community structure and 
      diversity characteristics were compared and analyzed using high-throughput 
      sequencing technology. RESULTS: These samples enabled the identification of 32 
      phyla, 52 classes, 121 orders, 251 families, and 593 genera of bacteria. The 
      phyla primarily included Proteobacteria, Acidobacteria, and Cyanobacteria among 
      others. Proteobacteria was the dominant phylum in the samples of bamboo shoots 
      and rhizome roots, whereas Acidobacteria was dominant in the rhizosphere and 
      forest soil samples. The predominant genera of the rhizome root samples were 
      Acidothermus, Bradyrhizobium and Acidobacterium, and the predominant genera of 
      the soil samples were Acidothermus and Acidobacterium. CONCLUSIONS: This study 
      preliminarily revealed the regularity between the growth and development of 
      bamboo shoots and the changes in the community structure of rhizosphere soil and 
      endophytic bacteria, which provides insights into the relationship between growth 
      and the bacterial community structure in different stages of bamboo shoots.

AB  - Nitrogen (N) as an essential macronutrient affects the soil nutrient cycle, 
      microbial community abundance, and metabolic function. However, the specific 
      responses of microorganisms and metabolic functions in rhizosphere soil of 
      Phellodendron chinense Schneid seedlings to N addition remain unclear. In this 
      study, four treatments (CK, N5, N10 and N15) were conducted, and the soil 
      physicochemical properties, enzyme activities, microbial community abundances and 
      diversities, metabolism, and gene expressions were investigated in rhizosphere 
      soil of P. chinense Schneid. The results showed that N addition significantly 
      decreased rhizosphere soil pH, among which the effect of N10 treatment was 
      better. N10 treatment significantly increased the contents of available 
      phosphorus (AP), available potassium (AK), ammonium nitrogen (NH(4)(+)-N), 
      nitrate nitrogen (NO(3)(-)-N) and sucrase (SU) activity, as well as fungal 
      diversity and the relative expression abundances of amoA and phoD genes in 
      rhizosphere soil, but observably decreased the total phosphorus (TP) content, 
      urease (UR) activity and bacterial diversity, among which the pH, soil organic 
      matter (SOM), AP, NH(4)(+)-N and NO(3)(-)-N were the main environmental factors 
      for affecting rhizosphere soil microbial community structure based on RDA and 
      correlation analyses. Meanwhile, N10 treatment notably enhanced the absolute 
      abundances of the uracil, guanine, indole, prostaglandin F2alpha and 
      gamma-glutamylalanine, while reduced the contents of D-phenylalanine and 
      phenylacetylglycine in rhizosphere soil of P. chinense Schneid seedlings. 
      Furthermore, the soil available nutrients represented a significant correlation 
      with soil metabolites and dominant microorganisms, suggesting that N10 addition 
      effectively regulated microbial community abundance and metabolic functions by 
      enhancing nutrient cycle in the rhizosphere soil of P. chinense Schneid 
      seedlings.

AB  - Alnus spp. (alder) are typical nonleguminous nitrogen-fixing trees that have a 
      symbiotic relationship with Frankia. To explore the differences in 
      nitrogen-fixing microorganisms between three alders (A. cremastogyne, A. 
      glutinosa, and A. formosana) with different chromosome ploidies, the community 
      structure and compositional diversity of potential nitrogen-fixing microorganism 
      in root nodules and rhizosphere soil were comparatively analyzed using 16S rRNA 
      and nitrogenase (nifH) gene sequencing. The nitrogen contents in the root nodules 
      and rhizosphere soil were also determined. The results showed that the contents 
      of total nitrogen and nitrate nitrogen in the root nodules of the three alders 
      are significantly higher than those in the rhizosphere soils, while the ammonium 
      nitrogen content show the opposite trend. The family, genus, and species levels 
      showed obviously differences between root nodules and rhizosphere soils, while 
      there were no significant differences at the classification level between the 
      three alders. At the phylum level, the dominant phyla from 16S rRNA and nifH gene 
      data in the root nodules and rhizosphere soil of the three alders are phylum 
      Actinomycetota and phylum Pseudomonadota, respectively. The LEfSe results showed 
      that there are significant differences in the dominant groups in the root nodules 
      and rhizosphere oil of the three alders. The relative abundances of dominant 
      groups also showed obvious differences between the root nodules and rhizosphere 
      soils of three alders. The relative abundances of Frankia and 
      unclassified_Frankia in root nodules are obviously higher than those in 
      rhizosphere soils, and their relative abundances in A. glutinosa root nodules are 
      significantly higher than those in A. cremastogyne and A. formosana at the genus 
      and species levels. The diversity of potential nitrogen-fixing microorganism from 
      16S rRNA and nifH gene data in the A. glutinosa root nodules and rhizosphere 
      soils are all higher than those in A. cremastogyne and A. formosana. The results 
      of functional prediction also showed that the OTUs for nitrogen fixation, nitrate 
      respiration, and ureolysis in A. glutinosa root nodules are higher than those in 
      the other two alders. Redundancy analysis revealed that the total nitrogen 
      content mostly affects the Frankia community. Overall, there are significant 
      differences in the community composition and structure of potential 
      nitrogen-fixing microorganism in the root nodules and rhizosphere soils between 
      the three alders. A. glutinosa showed a relatively stronger nitrogen fixation 
      capacity than A. formosana and A. cremastogyne. The results help elucidates how 
      the community structure and nitrogen-fixing ability of potential nitrogen-fixing 
      microorganism differ between alder species and serve as a reference for applying 
      Frankia to alder plantations.

AB  - Moso bamboo (Phyllostachys edulis) is a valuable nontimber forestry product with 
      a biennial cycle, producing abundant bamboo shoots within one year (on-year) and 
      few shoots within the following year (off-year). Moso bamboo plants undergo 
      clonal reproduction, resulting in similar genetic backgrounds. However, the 
      number of moso bamboo shoots produced each year varies. Despite this variation, 
      the impact of soil nutrients and the root microbiome on the biennial bearing of 
      moso bamboo is poorly understood. We collected 139 soil samples and determined 14 
      major physicochemical properties of the rhizosphere, rhizoplane, and bulk soil in 
      different seasons (i.e., the growing and deciduous seasons) and different years 
      (i.e., on- and off-years). Based on 16S rRNA and metagenomic sequencing, major 
      variations were found in the rhizospheric microbial composition during different 
      seasons and years in the moso bamboo forest. Environmental driver analysis 
      revealed that essential nutrients (i.e., SOC, TOC, TN, P, and NH(4)(+)) were the 
      main drivers of the soil microbial community composition and were correlated with 
      the on- and off-year cycles. Moreover, 19 MAGs were identified as important 
      biomarkers that could distinguish on- and off-years. We found that both season 
      and year influenced both the microbial community structure and functional 
      pathways through the biosynthesis of nutrients that potentially interact with the 
      moso bamboo growth rhythm, especially the on-year root-associated microbiome, 
      which had a greater abundance of specific nutrients such as gibberellins and 
      vitamin B(6). This work provides a dynamic perspective of the differential 
      responses of various on- and off-year microbial communities and enhances our 
      understanding of bamboo soil microbiome biodiversity and stability.

AB  - Plant-mediated CH(4) transport (PMT) is the dominant pathway through which 
      soil-produced CH(4) can escape into the atmosphere and thus plays an important 
      role in controlling ecosystem CH(4) emission. PMT is affected by abiotic and 
      biotic factors simultaneously, and the effects of biotic factors, such as the 
      dominant plant species and their traits, can override the effects of abiotic 
      factors. Increasing evidence shows that plant-mediated CH(4) fluxes include not 
      only PMT, but also within-plant CH(4) production and oxidation due to the 
      detection of methanogens and methanotrophs attached to the shoots. Despite the 
      inter-species and seasonal differences, and the probable contribution of 
      within-plant microbes to total plant-mediated CH(4) exchange (PME), current 
      process-based ecosystem models only estimate PMT based on the bulk biomass or 
      leaf area index of aerenchymatous plants. We highlight five knowledge gaps to 
      which more research efforts should be devoted. First, large between-species 
      variation, even within the same family, complicates general estimation of PMT, 
      and calls for further work on the key dominant species in different types of 
      wetlands. Second, the interface (rhizosphere-root, root-shoot, or 
      leaf-atmosphere) and plant traits controlling PMT remain poorly documented, but 
      would be required for generalizations from species to relevant functional groups. 
      Third, the main environmental controls of PMT across species remain uncertain. 
      Fourth, the role of within-plant CH(4) production and oxidation is poorly 
      quantified. Fifth, the simplistic description of PMT in current process models 
      results in uncertainty and potentially high errors in predictions of the 
      ecosystem CH(4) flux. Our review suggest that flux measurements should be 
      conducted over multiple growing seasons and be paired with trait assessment and 
      microbial analysis, and that trait-based models should be developed. Only then we 
      are capable to accurately estimate plant-mediated CH(4) emissions, and eventually 
      ecosystem total CH(4) emissions at both regional and global scales.

TI  - Shift in the rhizosphere soil fungal community associated with root rot infection 
      of Plukenetia volubilis Linneo caused by Fusarium and Rhizopus species.
PG  - 1231-1247
LID - 10.1007/s10123-023-00470-x [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Plukenetia volubilis Linneo is an oleaginous plant belonging to the 
      family Euphorbiaceae. Due to its seeds containing a high content of edible oil 
      and rich in vitamins, P. volubilis is cultivated as an economical 
      plant worldwide. However, the cultivation and growth of P. volubilis is 
      challenged by phytopathogen invasion leading to production loss. METHODS: In the 
      current study, we tested the pathogenicity of fungal pathogens isolated from root 
      rot infected P. volubilis plant tissues by inoculating them into healthy P. 
      volubilis seedlings. Metagenomic sequencing was used to assess the shift in the 
      fungal community of P. volubilis rhizosphere soil after root rot infection. 
      RESULTS: Four Fusarium isolates and two Rhizopus isolates were found to be root 
      rot causative agents of P. volubilis as they induced typical root rot symptoms in 
      healthy seedlings. The metagenomic sequencing data showed that root rot infection 
      altered the rhizosphere fungal community. In root rot infected soil, the richness 
      and diversity indices increased or decreased depending on pathogens. The four 
      most abundant phyla across all samples were Ascomycota, Glomeromycota, 
      Basidiomycota, and Mortierellomycota. In infected soil, the relative abundance of 
      each phylum increased or decreased depending on the pathogen and functional 
      taxonomic classification. CONCLUSIONS: Based on our results, we concluded that 
      Fusarium and Rhizopus species cause root rot infection of P. volubilis. In root 
      rot infected P. volubilis, the shift in the rhizosphere fungal community was 
      pathogen-dependent. These findings may serve as a key point for a future study on 
      the biocontrol of root rot of P. volubilis.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: The impact of groundwater table depth (GTD) on bacterial 
      communities and soil nutrition in revegetated areas remains unclear. METHODS: We 
      investigated the impacts of plant growth and soil physicochemical factors on 
      rhizosphere bacterial communities under different GTD. RESULTS: The four plant 
      growth indices (Pielou, Margalef, Simpson, and Shannon-Wiener indices) and soil 
      water content (SWC) at the Artem and Salix sites all showed a decreasing trend 
      with increasing GTD. Salix had a higher nutrient content than Artem. The response 
      of plant rhizosphere bacterial communities to GTD changes were as follows. 
      Rhizosphere bacteria at the Artem and Salix sites exhibited higher relative 
      abundance and alpha diversity in SW (GTD < 5 m) compared than in DW (GTD > 5 m). 
      Functional microbial predictions indicated that the rhizosphere bacterial 
      communities of Artem and Salix promoted carbon metabolism in the SW. In contrast, 
      Artem facilitated nitrogen cycling, whereas Salix enhanced both nitrogen cycling 
      and phototrophic metabolism in the DW. DISCUSSION: Mantel test analysis revealed 
      that in the SW of Artem sites, SWC primarily governed the diversity of 
      rhizosphere and functional bacteria involved in the nitrogen cycle by affecting 
      plant growth. In DW, functional bacteria increase soil organic carbon (SOC) to 
      meet nutrient demands. However, higher carbon and nitrogen availability in the 
      rhizosphere soil was observed in the SW of the Salix sites, whereas in DW, carbon 
      nutrient availability correlated with keystone bacteria, and changes in nitrogen 
      content could be attributed to nitrogen mineralization. This indicates that 
      fluctuations in the groundwater table play a role in regulating microbes and the 
      distribution of soil carbon and nitrogen nutrients in arid environments.

TI  - Short-term continuous monocropping reduces peanut yield mainly via altering soil 
      enzyme activity and fungal community.

AB  - Continuous monocropping can lead to soil sickness and increase of soil-borne 
      disease, which finally reduces crop yield. Microorganisms benefit plants by 
      increasing nutrient availability, participating in auxin synthesis, and defending 
      against pathogens. However, little is known about the influence of short-term 
      successive peanuts cropping on soil properties, enzyme activities, its yield, 
      plant-associated microbes, and their potential correlations in peanut production. 
      Here, we examined the community structure, composition, network structure and 
      function of microbes in the rhizosphere and bulk soils under different 
      monocropping years. Moreover, we assessed the impact of changes in the soil 
      micro-environment and associated soil microbes on peanut yield. Our results 
      showed that increase of monocropping year significantly decreased most soil 
      properties, enzyme activities and peanut yield (p < 0.05). Principal co-ordinates 
      analysis (PCoA) and analysis of similarities (ANOSIM) indicated that monocropping 
      year significantly influenced the fungal community structure in the rhizosphere 
      and bulk soils (p < 0.01), while had no effect on the bacterial community. With 
      the increase of continuous monocropping year, peanut selectively decreased (e.g., 
      Candidatus_Entotheonella, Bacillus and Bryobacter) or increased (e.g., 
      Nitrospira, Nocardioides, Ensifer, Gaiella, and Novosphingobium) the abundance of 
      some beneficial bacterial genera in the rhizosphere. Continuous monocropping 
      significantly increased the abundance of plant pathogens (e.g., Plectosphaerella, 
      Colletotrichum, Lectera, Gibberella, Metarhizium, and Microdochium) in the 
      rhizosphere and negatively affected the balance of fungal community. Besides, 
      these species were correlated negatively with L-leucine aminopeptidase (LAP) 
      activity. Network co-occurrence analysis showed that continuous monocropping 
      simplified the interaction network of bacteria and fungi. Random forest and 
      partial least squares path modeling (PLS-PM) analysis further showed that fungal 
      community, pathogen abundance, soil pH, and LAP activity negatively affected 
      peanut yield. In conclusion, short-term continuous monocropping decreased LAP 
      activity and increased potential fungal pathogens abundance, leading to reduction 
      of peanut yield.

TI  - Comparative Transcriptome Analysis Reveals the Molecular Mechanism of Bacillus 
      velezensis GJ-7 Assisting Panax notoginseng against Meloidogyne hapla.

AB  - The rhizosphere bacteria Bacillus velezensis GJ-7, as a biological control agent 
      (BCA), has significant biological control effects on Meloidogyne hapla, and has 
      strong colonization ability in the root of Panax notoginseng. In this study, we 
      conducted a comparative transcriptome analysis using P. notoginseng plant roots 
      treated with B. velezensis GJ-7 or sterile water alone and in combination with M. 
      hapla inoculation to explore the interactions involving the P. notoginseng plant, 
      B. velezensis GJ-7, and M. hapla. Four treatments from P. notoginseng roots were 
      sequenced, and twelve high-quality total clean bases were obtained, ranging from 
      3.57 to 4.74 Gb. The Gene Ontology (GO) classification and Kyoto Encyclopedia of 
      Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment showed that numerous DEGs are 
      involved in the phenylpropane biosynthesis pathway and the MAPK signaling pathway 
      in the roots of P. notoginseng with B. velezensis GJ-7 treatments. The analysis 
      results of the two signaling pathways indicated that B. velezensis GJ-7 could 
      enhance the expression of lignin- and camalexin-synthesis-related genes in plant 
      roots to resist M. hapla. In addition, B. velezensis GJ-7 could enhance plant 
      resistance to M. hapla by regulating the expression of resistance-related genes 
      and transcription factors (TFs), including ETR, ERF, ChiB, WRKY22, and PR1. The 
      expression of plant disease resistance genes in the roots of P. notoginseng with 
      different treatments was validated by using real-time quantitative PCR (qRT-PCR), 
      and the results were consistent with transcriptome sequencing. Taken together, 
      this study indicated that B. velezensis GJ-7 can trigger a stronger defense 
      response of P. notoginseng against M. hapla.

AB  - The tolerance of European alder (Alnus glutinosa Gaertn.) to soil salinity can be 
      attributed to symbiosis with microorganisms at the absorptive root level. 
      However, it is uncertain how soil salinity impacts microbial recruitment in the 
      following growing season. We describe the bacterial and fungal communities in the 
      rhizosphere and endosphere of A. glutinosa absorptive roots at three tested sites 
      with different salinity level. We determined the morphological diversity of 
      ectomycorrhizal (ECM) fungi, the endophytic microbiota in the rhizosphere, and 
      the colonization of new absorptive roots in the following growing season. While 
      bacterial diversity in the rhizosphere was higher than that in the absorptive 
      root endosphere, the opposite was true for fungi. Actinomycetota, Frankiales, 
      Acidothermus sp. and Streptomyces sp. were more abundant in the endosphere than 
      in the rhizosphere, while Actinomycetota and Acidothermus sp. dominated at saline 
      sites compared to nonsaline sites. Basidiomycota, Thelephorales, Russulales, 
      Helotiales, Cortinarius spp. and Lactarius spp. dominated the endosphere, while 
      Ascomycota, Hypocreales and Giberella spp. dominated the rhizosphere. The ECM 
      symbioses formed by Thelephorales (Thelephora, Tomentella spp.) constituted the 
      core community with absorptive roots in the spring and further colonized new root 
      tips during the growing season. With an increase in soil salinity, the overall 
      fungal abundance decreased, and Russula spp. and Cortinarius spp. were not 
      present at all. Similarly, salinity also negatively affected the average length 
      of the absorptive root. In conclusion, the endophytic microbiota in the 
      rhizosphere of A. glutinosa was driven by salinity and season, while the ECM 
      morphotype community was determined by the soil fungal community present during 
      the growing season and renewed in the spring.

      continuously planted Casuarina equisetifolia growth inhibition and their

AB  - Casuarina equisetifolia (C. equisetifolia) is an economically important forest 
      tree species, often cultivated in continuous monoculture as a coastal protection 
      forest. Continuous planting has gradually affected growth and severely restricted 
      the sustainable development of the C. equisetifolia industry. In this study, we 
      analyzed the effects of continuous planting on C. equisetifolia growth and 
      explored the rhizosphere soil microecological mechanism from a metagenomic 
      perspective. The results showed that continuous planting resulted in dwarfing, 
      shorter root length, and reduced C. equisetifolia seedling root system. 
      Metagenomics analysis showed that 10 key characteristic microorganisms, mainly 
      Actinoallomurus, Actinomadura, and Mycobacterium, were responsible for 
      continuously planted C. equisetifolia trees. Quantitative analysis showed that 
      the number of microorganisms in these three genera decreased significantly with 
      the increase of continuous planting. Gene function analysis showed that 
      continuous planting led to the weakening of the environmental information 
      processing-signal transduction ability of soil characteristic microorganisms, and 
      the decrease of C. equisetifolia trees against stress. Reduced capacity for 
      metabolism, genetic information processing-replication and repair resulted in 
      reduced microbial propagation and reduced microbial quantity in the rhizosphere 
      soil of C. equisetifolia trees. Secondly, amino acid metabolism, carbohydrate 
      metabolism, glycan biosynthesis and metabolism, lipid metabolism, metabolism of 
      cofactors and vitamins were all significantly reduced, resulting in a decrease in 
      the ability of the soil to synthesize and metabolize carbon and nitrogen. These 
      reduced capacities further led to reduced soil microbial quantity, microbial 
      carbon and nitrogen, microbial respiration intensity, reduced soil enzyme 
      nutrient cycling and resistance-related enzyme activities, a significant 
      reduction in available nutrient content of rhizosphere soils, a reduction in the 
      ion exchange capacity, and an impediment to C. equisetifolia growth. This study 
      provides an important basis for the management of continuously planted C. 
      equisetifolia plantations.

      aspect in Karst soils: a case study of Rhododendron Pudingense.
PG  - 1267759

LID - 1267759
AB  - Enzyme stoichiometry can reflect the resource limitation of soil microbial 
      metabolism, and research on the relationships between plants and resource 
      limitation in Karst Microhabitats is scarcely investigated. To clarify the 
      extracellular enzyme stoichiometry characteristics in soil across different karst 
      microhabitats and how the Rhododendron pudingense adapts to nutrient 
      restrictions, plot investigation experiments were set up in Zhenning County, 
      Qinglong County, and Wangmo County of Guizhou Province which included total three 
      karst microhabitats, i.e., soil surface (SS), rock gully (RG), and rock surface 
      (RS), by analyzing he rhizosphere soil nutrient, extracellular enzyme activity, 
      and nutrient content of R. pudingense. The findings indicated that all karst 
      microenvironments experienced varying levels of nitrogen (N) limitation, with the 
      order of N limitation being as follows: SS > RG > RS. Notably, there were 
      significant discrepancies in N content among different plant organs (p< 0.05), 
      with the sequence of N content as follows: leaf > stem > root. However, no 
      significant differences were observed in nutrient content within the same organ 
      across different microenvironments (p > 0.05). A noteworthy discovery was the 
      significant allometric growth relationship between C-P in various organs (p< 
      0.05), while roots and stems exhibited a significant allometric growth 
      relationship between N-P (p< 0.05). The study highlighted the substantial impact 
      of Total Nitrogen (TN) and N-acquiring enzymes (NAE) on nutrient allocation 
      within the components of R. pudingense. Overall, the research demonstrated that N 
      was the primary limiting factor in the study area's soil, and R. pudingense's 
      nutrient allocation strategy was closely associated with N limitations in the 
      karst microenvironment. Specifically, the plant prioritized allocating its 
      limited N resources to its leaves, ensuring its survival. This investigation 
      provided valuable insights into how plants adapt to nutrient restrictions and 
      offered a deeper understanding of soil-plant interactions in karst ecosystems.

AB  - Fertilizer reduction and efficiency improvement is an important basis for 
      ensuring the safety of the agricultural ecological environment. Microorganisms 
      are the key driving force for regulating the soil nitrogen and phosphorus cycle. 
      Studying the nitrogen and phosphorus transformation function of rhizosphere 
      microorganisms can provide a microbiological regulation approach for further 
      improving the use efficiency of soil nitrogen and phosphorus. Based on the field 
      micro-plot experiments of three typical farmland soils(phaeozem, cambisol, and 
      acrisol), metagenomic sequencing technology was used to study the differences in 
      functional genes and regulatory factors of maize rhizosphere microorganisms 
      during soil nitrogen and phosphorus transformation. The results showed that the 
      functional diversity of maize rhizosphere microorganisms was affected by soil 
      type. The functional diversity of rhizosphere microorganisms in phaeozem and 
      cambisol was mainly affected by water content and nutrient content, and that in 
      acrisol was affected by total phosphorus(TP) and available phosphorus(AP). For 
      soil nitrogen transformation, the gene abundance of related enzymes in the 
      pathway of nitrogen transformation was the highest in the urease gene(ureC) and 
      glucose dehydrogenase gene(gdh), which were 7.25x10(-5)-12.88x10(-5) and 
      4.47x10(-5)-7.49x10(-5), respectively. The total abundance of assimilatory 
      nitrate reduction functional genes in acrisol was higher than that in phaeozem 
      and cambisol, and the total abundance of functional genes related to other 
      processes was the highest in cambisol. The abundance of functional genes encoding 
      enzymes related to nitrogen metabolism was mainly driven by soil bacterial 
      richness, total potassium(TK), and TP. For soil phosphorus transformation, the 
      number of alkaline phosphatase genes(phoD) catalyzing organic phosphorus 
      mineralization was 1093, and the number of acid phosphatase genes(PHO) was 42. 
      The abundance of phoD was two orders of magnitude higher than that of PHO. In 
      addition, fertilization had no significant effect on the abundance of phoD and 
      PHO in the same soil type. Random forest analysis showed that the abundances of 
      phoD and PHO were significantly affected by soil moisture, organic matter(OM), 
      and total nitrogen(TN), but AP content had the greatest impact on PHO abundance. 
      These results clarified the nitrogen and phosphorus transformation 
      characteristics of maize rhizosphere microorganisms at the functional genomic 
      level and enriched the molecular biological mechanism of the microbial nitrogen 
      and phosphorus transformation function.

TI  - Analysis of rhizosphere fungal community of agricultural crops cultivated in 
      laboratory experiments on Chernevaya taiga soil.

AB  - Chernevaya taiga of Western Siberia, Russia, is a unique ecosystem characterized 
      by fertile soil, exceptionally large herbaceous plant sizes, and extraordinarily 
      rapid rates of plant residue degradation. We expected that growing crops on soil 
      collected from Chernevaya taiga, which has never been used for agricultural 
      purposes before, would result in a distinct rhizospheric fungal community. This 
      community could potentially yield novel, potent biostimulators and biocontrol 
      fungi for modern agriculture. To check this idea, we used high-throughput ITS 
      sequencing to examine the microbial communities in the rhizosphere of spring 
      wheat and radish grown in greenhouse experiments on Chernevaya and control soils. 
      Additionally, representative fungal strains were isolated and assessed for their 
      ability to promote growth in wheat seedlings. The study revealed that the most 
      abundant phyla in the rhizospheric fungal community were Mortierellomycota, 
      primarily consisting of Mortierella species, and Ascomycota. Mucor and Umbelopsis 
      comprised the majority of Mucoromycota in the control soils. Fusarium and 
      Oidiodendron, two potentially plant-pathogenic fungi, were only found in the 
      rhizosphere of crops grown in the control soil. Conversely, Chernevaya soil 
      contained a diverse range of potential biocontrol fungi for plants. Tested novel 
      fungal isolates showed a stimulating effect on the development of wheat seedlings 
      and positively affected their rate of biomass accumulation. The results of the 
      study demonstrate that the soil of Chernevaya taiga do indeed contain fungi with 
      prominent potential to stimulate agricultural plants growth.

LID - 109791
AB  - Agathis australis (New Zealand kauri) is a significant and iconic native tree of 
      Aotearoa New Zealand. Currently, Phytophthora agathidicida that causes 
      kauri-dieback disease is killing kauri trees. Only 1% of the New Zealand virgin 
      kauri forest remains [1,2]. Recent studies revealed that many soil-borne 
      microorganisms had been found to systemically boost the defensive capacity of the 
      trees by providing competition to pathogens for nutrient intake, thus preventing 
      pathogen colonization and modulating plant immunity [3,4]. In addition, the root 
      microbiome consists of an entire complex rhizosphere-associated microbes with 
      their genetic elements and interactions that have influenced plant health. To 
      date, very few studies have been conducted to investigate the microorganisms in 
      the kauri soil and possible environmental drivers. To characterize the functional 
      gene profile in relation to soil microbial diversity of the kauri trees at 
      Auckland Botanic Gardens (ABG), Auckland, New Zealand the GeoChip 5.0 M (Glomics 
      Inc. USA), a microarray-based metagenomics tool, was used. GeoChip 5.0 M 
      comprises of 162,000 probes from 365,000 target genes (coding DNA sequence - 
      CDS), which covers all taxonomic groups (archaea, bacteria, fungi, protists, 
      algae, and viruses) [5]. The ABG has kauri trees that are approximately 20 years 
      old, located in three distinct man-made environments: Native Forest, Kauri Grove, 
      and Rose Garden. We selected two trees from the Native Forest and two from the 
      Kauri Grove for our experiment. Soil samples were collected from the four 
      cardinal points of each tree, at 10 cm depth. Pooled environmental DNA was sent 
      to Glomics (USA) and the data were preprocessed using GeoChip data analysis 
      pipeline described in http://www.ou.edu/ieg/tools/data-analysispipeline.html. 
      Based on the GeoChip data generated from the soil samples, we have detected a 
      total of 946 genes, 4342 taxa, 102 phyla, and 995 genera. The data presented here 
      provide an overview of functional genes associated with kauri soil, which can 
      serve as baseline for other kauri soil microbiome analysis at forest-scale 
      studies. The raw data has been uploaded to Mendeley Data 
      https://doi.org/10.17632/T22NNN385K.1.

AB  - Arrow bamboo (Fargesia nitida) is a pioneer plant in secondary forest succession 
      in the Sichuan Province mountains. To comprehensively investigate the microbial 
      communities and their functional variations in different rhizocompartments (root 
      endosphere, rhizosphere, and root zone) of arrow bamboo (Fargesia nitida), a 
      high-throughput metagenomic study was conducted in the present study. The results 
      showed that the abundances of the dominant bacterial phyla Proteobacteria and 
      Actinobacteria in the bamboo root endosphere were significantly lower than those 
      in the rhizosphere and root zones. In contrast, the dominant fungal phyla, 
      Ascomycota and Basidiomycota, showed the opposite tendency. Lower microbial 
      diversity, different taxonomic composition and functional profiles, and a greater 
      abundance of genes involved in nitrogen fixation (nifB), cellulose degradation 
      (beta-glucosidase), and cellobiose transport (cellulose 1, 4-beta-cellobiosidase) 
      were found in the bamboo root endosphere than in the other rhizocompartments. 
      Greater soil total carbon, total nitrogen, NH(4)(+)-N, microbial biomass carbon, 
      and greater activities of invertase and urease were found in the bamboo root zone 
      than in the adjacent soil (spruce root zone). In contrast, the soil microbial 
      community and functional profiles were similar. At the phylum level, invertase 
      was significantly related to 31 microbial taxa, and the effect of NH(4)(+)-N on 
      the microbial community composition was greater than that of NO(3)(-)-N. The soil 
      physicochemical properties and enzyme activities were significantly correlated 
      with microbial function. These results indicate that the root endosphere 
      microbiomes of arrow bamboo were strongly selected by the host plant, which 
      caused changes in the soil nutrient properties in the subalpine coniferous 
      forest.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: The average carbon storage of Pinus massoniana is much higher than 
      the average carbon storage of Chinese forests, an important carbon sink tree 
      species in subtropical regions of China. However, there are few studies on the 
      differences in rhizosphere microorganisms of P. massoniana with different carbon 
      storages. METHODS: To clarify the relationships between plant carbon storage 
      level, environmental parameters and microbial community structure, we identified 
      three carbon storage levels from different P. massoniana provenances and 
      collected rhizosphere soil samples. We determined chemical properties of soil, 
      extracellular enzyme activity, and microbial community structures at different 
      carbon storage levels and examined how soil factors affect rhizosphere 
      microorganisms under different carbon storage levels. RESULTS: The results 
      revealed that soil organic carbon (SOC), nitrate nitrogen (NO(3)(-)-N), ammonium 
      nitrogen (NH(4)(+)-N) contents all increased with increasing carbon storage 
      levels, while pH decreased accordingly. In contrast, the available phosphorus 
      (AP) content did not change significantly. The soil AP content was within the 
      range of 0.91 ~ 1.04 mg/kg. The microbial community structure of P. massoniana 
      changed with different carbon storage, with Acidobacteria (44.27%), 
      Proteobacteria (32.57%), and Actinobacteria (13.43%) being the dominant bacterial 
      phyla and Basidiomycota (73.36%) and Ascomycota (24.64%) being the dominant 
      fungal phyla across the three carbon storage levels. Soil fungi were more 
      responsive to carbon storage than bacteria in P. massoniana. C/N, NH(4)(+)-N, 
      NO(3)(-)-N, and SOC were the main drivers (p < 0.05) of changes in rhizosphere 
      microbial communities. DISCUSSION: The results revealed that in the rhizosphere 
      there were significant differences in soil carbon cycle and microorganism 
      nutrient preferences at different carbon storages of P. massoniana provenance, 
      which were significantly related to the changes in rhizosphere microbial 
      community structure. Jiangxi Anyuan (AY) provenance is more suitable for the 
      construction of high carbon storage plantation.

AB  - Biochar as an agricultural soil amendment plays vital roles in mediating methane 
      (CH(4)) and nitrous oxide (N(2)O) emissions in soils. The link between different 
      types of biochar, bulk soil, and rhizosphere microbial communities in relation to 
      CH(4) and N(2)O emissions is being investigated in this study. The rice pot 
      experiment was conducted using biochar at two temperatures (300 degrees C and 500 degrees C) in 
      combination with three biochar levels (0, 2, 10% w/w). Soil properties and the 
      abundance of genes associated with CH(4) and N(2)O emissions from both 
      rhizosphere and bulk soils were investigated. The study also aimed to examine the 
      structure of microbial communities (pmoA, nosZ) in rhizosphere and bulk soils 
      whereas CH(4) and N(2)O emissions were monitored while growing rice. Results 
      showed that biochar at 300 degrees C and 10% incorporation significantly increased the 
      CH(4) emissions by up to 59% rise compared to the control group. Random Forest 
      analysis revealed that the ratio of mcrA/pmoA along with the abundance of mcrA 
      from both rhizosphere and bulk soils, the abundance of AOA, TN, DOC, and the 
      community composition of pmoA-harboring microorganisms from both bulk and 
      rhizosphere soils were important predictors of CH(4) emissions. Therefore, the 
      ratio of mcrA/pmoA in rhizosphere soil and the abundance of AOA in bulk soil were 
      the main factors influencing CH(4) emissions. Variation Partitioning Analysis 
      (VPA) results indicated that the effects of these factors on bulk soil were 9% of 
      CH(4) emissions variations in different treatments, which contributed more than 
      rhizosphere soils' factors. Moreover, random forest analysis results indicated 
      that the abundance of AOB in bulk soil was the most important predictor 
      influencing N(2)O emissions. The VPA result revealed that the factors in 
      rhizosphere soil could explain more than 28% of the variations in N(2)O 
      emissions. Our study highlights that rhizosphere soil has a more significant 
      effect than bulk soil on N(2)O production. Our findings further the understanding 
      of the link between bulk and rhizosphere attributes, and their impact on CH(4) 
      and N(2)O emissions in paddy soils. In summary, we recommend the application of 
      biochar at 500 degrees C and 2% incorporation rate for agricultural production in the 
      area.

TI  - Investigating Verticillium wilt occurrence in cotton and its risk management by 
      the direct return of cotton plants infected with Verticillium dahliae to the 
      field.

AB  - Verticillium wilt is one of the most crucial diseases caused by Verticillium 
      dahliae that threatens the cotton industry. Statistical results showed that the 
      return of cotton plants infected with V. dahliae to the field might be an 
      essential cause of the continuous aggravation of cotton Verticillium wilt. The 
      correlation among the cotton plants infected with V. dahliae returning to the 
      field, the occurrence of Verticillium wilt, and the number of microsclerotia in 
      rhizosphere soil need further investigation. A potted experiment was carried out 
      to explore the effects of the direct return of cotton plants infected with 
      Verticillium dahliae to the field on the subsequent growth and Verticillium wilt 
      occurrence in cotton. As a risk response plan, we investigated the feasibility of 
      returning dung-sand (i.e., insect excreta) to the field, the dung-sand was from 
      the larvae of Protaetia brevitarsis (Coleoptera: Cetoniidea) that were fed with 
      the V. dahliae-infected cotton plants. The results demonstrated that the return 
      of the entire cotton plants to the field presented a promotional effect on the 
      growth and development of cotton, whereas the return of a single root stubble or 
      cotton stalks had an inhibitive effect. The return of cotton stalks and root 
      stubble infected with V. dahliae increased the risk and degree of Verticillium 
      wilt occurrence. The disease index of Verticillium wilt occurrence in cotton was 
      positively correlated with the number of microsclerotia in the rhizosphere soil. 
      The disease index increased by 20.00%, and the number of soil microsclerotia 
      increased by 8.37 fold in the treatment of returning root stubble infected with 
      V. dahliae to the field. No Verticillium wilt microsclerotia were detected in the 
      feed prepared from cotton stalks and root stubble fermented for more than 5 days 
      or in the transformed dung-sand. There was no risk of inoculation with 
      Verticillium wilt microsclerotia when the dung-sand was returned to the field. 
      The indirect return of cotton plants infected with V. dahliae to the field by 
      microorganism-insect systems is worthy of further exploration plan of the green 
      prevention and control for Verticillium wilt and the sustainable development of 
      the cotton industry.

AB  - The sustainable intensification of maize-based systems may reduce greenhouse-gas 
      emissions and the excessive use of non-renewable inputs. Considering the key role 
      that the microbiological fertility has on crop growth and resilience, it is worth 
      of interest studying the role of cropping system on the rhizosphere bacterial 
      communities, that affect soil health and biological soil fertility. In this work 
      we monitored and characterized the diversity and composition of native 
      rhizosphere bacterial communities during the early growth phases of two maize 
      genotypes of different early vigor, using a nitrogen (N)-phosphorus (P) starter 
      fertilization and a biostimulant seed treatment, in a growth chamber experiment, 
      by polymerase chain reaction-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis of partial 
      16S rRNA gene and amplicon sequencing. Cluster analyses showed that the 
      biostimulant treatment affected the rhizosphere bacterial microbiota of the 
      ordinary hybrid more than that of the early vigor, both at plant emergence and at 
      the 5-leaf stage. Moreover, the diversity indices calculated from the community 
      profiles, revealed significant effects of NP fertilization on richness and the 
      estimated effective number of species (H(2)) in both maize genotypes, while the 
      biostimulant had a positive effect on plant growth promoting community of the 
      ordinary hybrid, both at the plant emergence and at the fifth leaf stage. Our 
      data showed that maize genotype was the major factor shaping rhizosphere 
      bacterial community composition suggesting that the root system of the two maize 
      hybrids recruited a different microbiota. Moreover, for the first time, we 
      identified at the species and genus level the predominant native bacteria 
      associated with two maize hybrids differing for vigor. These results pave the way 
      for further studies to be performed on the effects of cropping system and 
      specific crop practices, considering also the application of biostimulants, on 
      beneficial rhizosphere microorganisms.

AB  - The distribution of antibiotic-resistance genes (ARGs) in environmental soil is 
      greatly affected by livestock and poultry manure fertilization, the application 
      of manure will lead to antibiotic residues and ARGs pollution, and increase the 
      risk of environmental pollution and human health. Cinnamomum camphora is an 
      economically significant tree species in Fujian Province, China. Here, through 
      high-throughput sequencing analysis, significant differences in the composition 
      of the bacterial community and ARGs were observed between fertilized and 
      unfertilized rhizosphere soil. The application of chicken manure organic 
      fertilizer significantly increased the relative abundance and alpha diversity of 
      the bacterial community and ARGs. The content of organic matter, soluble organic 
      nitrogen, available phosphorus, nitrate reductase, hydroxylamine reductase, 
      urease, acid protease, beta-glucosidase, oxytetracycline, and tetracycline in the 
      soil of C. camphora forests have significant effects on bacterial community and 
      ARGs. Significant correlations between environmental factors, bacterial 
      communities, and ARGs were observed in the rhizosphere soil of C. camphora 
      forests according to Mantel tests. Overall, the findings of this study revealed 
      that chicken manure organic fertilizer application has a significant effect on 
      the bacterial community and ARGs in the rhizosphere soil of C. camphora forests, 
      and several environmental factors that affect the bacterial community and ARGs 
      were identified.

TI  - Bacteria Associated with Acute Oak Decline: Where Did They Come From? We Know 
      Where They Go.
LID - 10.3390/microorganisms11112789 [doi]
LID - 2789
AB  - Acute oak decline is a high-impact disease causing necrotic lesions on the trunk, 
      crown thinning and the eventual death of oak. Four bacterial species are 
      associated with the lesions-Brenneria goodwinii, Gibbsiella quercinecans, 
      Rahnella victoriana and Lonsdalea Britannica-although an epi-/endophytic 
      lifestyle has also been suggested for these bacteria. However, little is known 
      about their environmental reservoirs or their pathway to endophytic colonisation. 
      This work aimed to investigate the ability of the four AOD-associated bacterial 
      species to survive for prolonged periods within rhizosphere soil, leaves and 
      acorns in vitro, and to design an appropriate method for their recovery. This 
      method was trialled on field samples related to healthy and symptomatic oaks. The 
      in vitro study showed that the majority of these species could survive for at 
      least six weeks within each sample type. Results from the field samples 
      demonstrated that R. victoriana and G. quercinecans appear environmentally 
      widespread, indicating multiple routes of endophytic colonisation might be 
      plausible. B. goodwinii and L. britannica were only identified from acorns from 
      healthy and symptomatic trees, indicating they may be inherited members of the 
      endophytic seed microbiome and, despite their ability to survive outside of the 
      host, their environmental occurrence is limited. Future research should focus on 
      preventative measures targeting the abiotic factors of AOD, how endophytic 
      bacteria shift to a pathogenic cycle and the identification of resilient seed 
      stock that is less susceptible to AOD.

AB  - Pathogens, especially invasive species, have caused significant global 
      ecological, economic, and social losses in forests. Plant disease research has 
      traditionally focused on direct interactions between plants and pathogens in an 
      appropriate environment. However, recent research indicates that the microbiome 
      can interact with the plant host and pathogens to modulate plant resistance or 
      pathogen pathogenicity, thereby altering the outcome of plant-pathogen 
      interactions. Thus, this presents new opportunities for studying the microbial 
      management of forest diseases. Compared to parallel studies on human and crop 
      microbiomes, research into the forest tree microbiome and its critical role in 
      forest disease progression has lagged. The rapid development of microbiome 
      sequencing and analysis technologies has resulted in the rapid accumulation of a 
      large body of evidence regarding the association between forest microbiomes and 
      diseases. These data will aid the development of innovative, effective, and 
      environmentally sustainable methods for the microbial management of forest 
      diseases. Herein, we summarize the most recent findings on the dynamic structure 
      and composition of forest tree microbiomes in belowground and aboveground plant 
      tissues (i.e., rhizosphere, endosphere, and phyllosphere), as well as their 
      pleiotropic impact on plant immunity and pathogen pathogenicity, highlighting 
      representative examples of biological control agents used to modulate relevant 
      tree microbiomes. Lastly, we discuss the potential application of forest tree 
      microbiomes in disease control as well as their future prospects and challenges.

AB  - Sustainable transformation of agricultural plant production requires the 
      reduction of nitrogen (N) fertilizer application. Such a reduced N fertilizer 
      application may impede crop production due to an altered symbiosis of crops and 
      their rhizosphere microbiome, since reduced N input may affect the competition 
      and synergisms with the plant. The assessment of such changes in the crop 
      microbiome functionalities at spatial scales relevant for agricultural management 
      remains challenging. We investigated in a field plot experiment how and if the N 
      cycling guilds of the rhizosphere of globally relevant cereal crops - winter 
      barley, wheat and rye - are influenced by reduced N fertilization. Crop 
      productivity was assessed by remote sensing of the shoot biomass. Microbial N 
      cycling guilds were investigated by metagenomics targeting diazotrophs, 
      nitrifiers, denitrifiers and the dissimilatory nitrate to ammonium reducing guild 
      (DNRA). The functional composition of microbial N cycling guilds was explained by 
      crop productivity parameters and soil pH, and diverged substantially between the 
      crop species. The responses of individual microbial N cycling guild abundances to 
      shoot dry weight and rhizosphere nitrate content was modulated by the N 
      fertilization treatments and the crop species, which was identified based on 
      regression analyses. Thus, characteristic shifts in the microbial N cycling guild 
      acquisition associated with the crop host species were resolved. Particularly, 
      the rhizosphere of rye was enriched with potentially N-preserving microbial 
      guilds - diazotrophs and the DNRA guild - when no fertilizer was applied. We 
      speculate that the acquisition of microbial N cycling guilds was the result of 
      plant species-specific acquisition strategies. Thus, the investigated cereal crop 
      holobionts have likely different symbiotic strategies that make them differently 
      resilient against reduced N fertilizer inputs. Furthermore, we demonstrated that 
      these belowground patterns of N cycling guilds from the rhizosphere microbiome 
      are linked to remotely sensed aboveground plant productivity.

      microplastics had a greater effect on Cr accumulation in cucumber roots, stems, 
      and leaves than in fruits. PE microplastics increased, but PA and PLA 
      microplastics decreased the Cr accumulation in cucumber. Microplastics, 
      especially high-dose, small, and aged microplastics, exacerbated the effects of 
      accumulated Cr in cucumber on fresh weight and fruit yield. The nutrient contents 
      in fruits except soluble sugars were reduced by microplastics. The random forest 
      regression model shows that the microplastic type was the most important factor 
      causing changes in the soil-cucumber system except for Cr(VI) addition. Under 
      Cr(VI) and microplastic co-exposure, bacteria that could simultaneously tolerate 
      Cr(VI) stress and degrade microplastics were enriched in the rhizosphere soil. 
      The partial least squares path model shows that microplastics reduced the 
      beneficial effect of the bacterial community on cucumber growth. Microplastics, 
      especially PLA microplastics, alleviated the adverse effects of Cr(VI) stress on 
      root metabolism.

AB  - Molybdenum application holds the potential to enhance agricultural productivity. 
      However, the precise impact on soil microbial diversity and mineral nutrient 
      availability remains uncertain. In this study, we collected rhizosphere soil 
      samples from different growth stages of broad beans. By analyzing mineral element 
      contents, soil phosphorus and zinc fractions, as well as fungal and bacterial 
      diversity, we observed that Mo application resulted in a reduction of soil 
      Citrate‒P and HCl‒P content. This reduction led to an increase in available P 
      content at different stages. Moreover, Mo application elevated root P 
      concentration, but concurrently impeded the translocation of P to the shoots. Mo 
      application also decreased the soil Exc‒Zn (exchangeable Zn) content while 
      increasing the Res‒Zn (residual Zn) content, ultimately causing a decrease in 
      available Zn content at different stages. Consequently, the Zn concentration 
      within broad beans correspondingly decreased. Mo application fostered an 
      augmentation in fungal richness and Shannon indices at the branching and podding 
      stages. The analysis of microbial co-occurrence networks indicated that Mo 
      application bolstered positive connectivity among fungal taxa. Remarkably, Mo 
      significantly increased the abundance of Chaetomium, Leucosporidium, and 
      Thielavia fungi. Spearman correlation analysis demonstrated a significant 
      positive correlation between fungal diversity and soil available P content, as 
      well as a notable negative correlation with soil available Zn content. These 
      findings suggest that Mo application may modify the availability of soil P and Zn 
      by influencing fungal diversity in the rhizosphere of crop soil, ultimately 
      impacting nutrient accumulation within the grains.

AB  - The composition and diversity of the rhizosphere microbial community maintain the 
      stability of the root microclimate, and several studies have focused on this 
      aspect of rhizosphere microorganisms. However, how these communities vary with 
      cultivars of a species is not completely understood. Paeonia lactiflora-a 
      perennial herb species of the family Paeoniaceae-includes a wide variety of 
      cultivars, with rich rhizosphere microbial resources. Hence, we studied the 
      differences in rhizosphere bacterial communities associated with eight P. 
      lactiflora cultivars. We noted that Actinobacteria, Proteobacteria, 
      Acidobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Firmicutes, Verrucomicrobia, Planctomycetes and 
      Chloroflexi were the dominant phyla associated with the cultivars. The 
      composition of rhizosphere bacterial community of different cultivars was highly 
      similar at taxonomic levels, but there were slightly differences in the relative 
      abundance. LEfSe analysis showed that the cultivars "Sheng Tao Hua" and "Zi Lou 
      Xian Jin" exhibited the most biomarkers. Differential ASV analysis revealed the 
      maximum difference in ASV abundance between "Lian Tai" and "Zi Hong Zheng Hui", 
      as well as between "Sheng Tao Hua" and "Tao Hua Fei Xue", and the maximum 
      similarity between "Duo Ye Zi" and "Xue Feng". Co-occurrence network analysis 
      revealed that rhizosphere bacteria in most cultivars maintain homeostasis by 
      cooperation, wherein Actinobacteria and Proteobacteria played a vital role. In 
      addition, microbial resources related to cultivars like bioremediation, organic 
      degradation and resistance to diseases are found. This study revealed the 
      structures of the rhizosphere bacterial communities associated with different 
      cultivars of P. lactiflora and explored their stress resistance potential, which 
      can be used to guide future agricultural practices.

AB  - Forests are composed of various plant species, and rhizosphere soil microbes are 
      driven by root exudates. However, the interplay between root exudates, microbial 
      communities in the rhizosphere soil of canopy trees, understory shrubs, grasses, 
      and their responses to nitrogen (N) deposition remains unclear. Pinus 
      tabulaeformis, Rosa xanthina, and Carex lancifolia were used to investigate root 
      exudates, rhizosphere soil microbial communities, and their responses to N 
      application in forest ecosystem. Root exudate abundances of P. tabulaeformis were 
      significantly higher than that of R. xanthina and C. lancifolia, with 
      carbohydrates dominating P. tabulaeformis and R. xanthina root exudates, fatty 
      acids prevailing in C. lancifolia root exudates. Following N application, root 
      exudate abundances of P. tabulaeformis and R. xanthina initially increased before 
      decreasing, whereas those of C. lancifolia decreased. Microbial number of 
      rhizosphere soil of C. lancifolia was higher than that of P. tabulaeformis and R. 
      xanthina, but there was insignificant variation of rhizosphere soil microbial 
      diversity among plant species. N application exerted promotional and inhibitory 
      impacts on bacterial and fungal numbers, respectively, while bacterial and fungal 
      diversities were increased by N application. Overall, N application had negative 
      effects on root exudates of P. tabulaeformis, inhibiting rhizosphere soil 
      microbial populations. N application suppressed rhizosphere soil microbial 
      populations by increasing root exudates of R. xanthina. Conversely, N application 
      elevated nutrient content in the rhizosphere soil of C. lancifolia, reducing root 
      exudates and minimally promoting microbial populations. This study highlights the 
      importance of understory vegetation in shaping soil microbial communities within 
      forests under N deposition.

TI  - Rapid bark-mediated tree stem methane transport occurs independently of the 
      transpiration stream in Melaleuca quinquenervia.
PG  - 49-60
LID - 10.1111/nph.19404 [doi]
AB  - Tree stem methane emissions are important components of lowland forest methane 
      budgets. The potential for species-specific behaviour among co-occurring lowland 
      trees with contrasting bark characteristics has not been investigated. We compare 
      bark-mediated methane transport in two common lowland species of contrasting bark 
      characteristics (Melaleuca quinquenervia featuring spongy/layered bark with 
      longitudinally continuous airspaces and Casuarina glauca featuring hard/dense 
      common bark) through several manipulative experiments. First, the progressive 
      cutting through M. quinquenervia bark layers caused exponential increases in 
      methane fluxes (c. 3 orders of magnitude); however, sapwood-only fluxes were 
      lower, suggesting that upward/axial methane transport occurs between bark layers. 
      Second, concentrated methane pulse-injections into exposed M. quinquenervia bark, 
      revealed rapid axial methane transport rates (1.42 mm s(-1) ), which were further 
      supported through laboratory-simulated experiments (1.41 mm s(-1) ). 
      Laboratory-simulated radial CH(4) diffusion rates (through bark) were c. 20-times 
      slower. Finally, girdling M. quinquenervia stems caused a near-instantaneous 
      decrease in methane flux immediately above the cut. By contrast, girdling C. 
      glauca displayed persistent, though diminished, methane fluxes. Overall, the 
      experiments revealed evidence for rapid 'between-bark' methane transport 
      independent from the transpiration stream in M. quinquenervia, which facilitates 
      diffusive axial transport from the rhizosphere and/or sapwood sources. This 
      contrasts with the slower, radial 'through-bark' diffusive-dominated gas 
      transportation in C. glauca.

AB  - White birch (Betula platyphylla Suk.) is a typical pioneer tree species that is 
      important in forest restoration in northern China, Japan, and Korea. In the 
      present study, 37 isolates were obtained from B. platyphylla rhizosphere soils in 
      Heilongjiang Province; they were identified as T. pleuroticola (3 isolates), T. 
      virens (2 isolates), T. hamatum (8 isolates), T. atroviride (21 isolates, 
      dominant species) and T. asperelloides (3 isolates). Stress tolerance tests 
      (salt, alkali, and nutritional stress that simulated saline alkali or barren 
      soil) and confrontation assays (with four pathogens) were performed to determine 
      which isolates had good biocontrol ability in barren soil; the results show that 
      T. atroviride was outstanding. Then, in order to determine the effect of T. 
      atroviride on plants and soil, Gynura cusimbua seeds were sown and treated with a 
      T. atroviride spore suspension, as was unsown soil. The seedlings treated using 
      T. atroviride had significantly greater height, stem diameter, soluble protein 
      content, soluble sugar content, and malonaldehyde (MDA) content and their 
      catalase (CAT) activity was also significantly increased. In addition, when the 
      plants were inoculated with Alternaria alternata, the plants treated using T. 
      atroviride had stronger CAT activity, significantly higher soluble protein 
      content and soluble sugar content, and significantly lower MDA content, which 
      indicates stronger resistance and less injury caused by the pathogen. In 
      addition, T. atroviride not only increased the content of available nitrogen and 
      available phosphorus in the soil, but also promoted G. cusimbua seedlings' 
      absorption of available nitrogen and available phosphorus. Thus, the 
      characteristics of T. atroviride may make it the main factor that helps B. 
      platyphylla colonise cut-over lands. T. atroviride, a promising biocontrol 
      candidate, can be used in agriculture and forestry.

AB  - Interactions between plants and soil microbes are important to plant hybrid 
      breeding under global change. However, the relationship between host plants and 
      rhizosphere soil microorganisms has not been fully elucidated. Understanding the 
      rhizosphere microbial structure of parents and progenies would provide a deeper 
      insight into how genetic effects modulate the relationship between plants and 
      soil. In this study, two family groups of poplar trees (A: parents and their two 
      progenies; B: parents and their one progeny) with different genetic backgrounds 
      (including seven genotypes) were selected from a common garden, and their 
      rhizobacterial communities were analyzed to explore parent-progeny relationships. 
      Our results showed significant differences in phylogenetic diversity, the number 
      of 16S genes and the structure of rhizosphere bacterial communities (Adonis: 
      R(2) = 0.166, P < 0.01) between different family groups. Rhizosphere bacterial 
      community structure was significantly dominated by genetic effects. Compared with 
      abundant taxa, genetic effects were more powerful drivers of rare taxa. In 
      addition, bacterial communities of hybrid progenies were all significantly more 
      similar to their parents compared to the other group of parents, especially among 
      rare taxa. The two poplar family groups exhibited differences between their 
      rhizosphere bacterial co-occurrence networks. Group B had a relatively complex 
      network with 2380 edges and 468 nodes, while group A had 1829 edges and 304 
      nodes. Soil organic carbon and carbon to nitrogen ratio (C/N) also influenced the 
      rhizosphere bacterial community assembly. This was especially true for soil C/N, 
      which explained 23 % of the beta-nearest taxon index (betaNTI) variation in rare taxa. 
      Our results reveal the relationship of rhizosphere microorganisms between parents 
      and progenies. This can help facilitate an understanding of the combination of 
      plant breeding with microbes resource utilization and provide a theoretical basis 
      for scientific advancement to support the development of forestry industry.

AB  - Soil heavy metal contamination and salinity constitute a major environmental 
      problem worldwide. The affected area and impact of these problems are increasing 
      day by day; therefore, it is imperative to restore their potential using 
      environmentally friendly technology. Plant growth-promoting rhizobacteria (PGPR) 
      provides a better option in this context. Thirty-seven bacteria were isolated 
      from the rhizosphere of maize cultivated in metal- and salt-affected soils. Some 
      selected bacterial strains grew well under a wide range of pH (4-10), salt 
      (5-50 g/L), and Cd (50-1000 mg/L) stress. Three bacterial strains, 
      Exiguobacterium aestuarii (UM1), Bacillus cereus (UM8), and Bacillus megaterium 
      (UM35), were selected because of their robust growth and high tolerance to both 
      stress conditions. The bacterial strains UM1, UM8, and UM35 showed 
      P-solubilization, whereas UM8 and UM35 exhibited 
      1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate deaminase activity and indole acetic acid (IAA) 
      production, respectively. The bacterial strains were inoculated on Brassica 
      juncea plants cultivated in Cd and salt-affected soils due to the above PGP 
      activities and stress tolerance. Plants inoculated with the bacterial strains B. 
      cereus and B. megaterium significantly (p < 0.05) increased shoot fresh weight 
      (17 +/- 1.17-29 +/- 0.88 g/plant), shoot dry weight 
      (2.50 +/- 0.03-4.40 +/- 0.32 g/plant), root fresh weight 
      (7.30 +/- 0.58-13.30 +/- 0.58 g/plant), root dry weight 
      (0.80 +/- 0.04-2.00 +/- 0.01 g/plant), and shoot K contents 
      (62.76 +/- 1.80-105.40 +/- 1.15 mg/kg dwt) in normal and stressful conditions. The 
      bacterial strain B. megaterium significantly (p < 0.05) decreased shoot Na(+) and 
      Cd(++) uptake in single and dual stress conditions. Both bacterial strains, E. 
      aestuarii and B. cereus, efficiently reduced Cd(++) translocation and 
      bioaccumulation in the shoot. Bacterial inoculation improved the uptake of K(+) 
      and Ca(++), while restricted Na(+) and Cd(++) in B. juncea shoots indicated their 
      potential to mitigate the dual stresses of salt and Cd in B. juncea through ion 
      homeostasis.

AB  - The rhizosphere effect of plants affects soil organic carbon (SOC) 
      mineralization. It is still unclear for the mechanism by which the rhizosphere 
      effect of dominant plants in secondary broadleaved forest habitats invaded by 
      moso bamboo affects SOC mineralization. Taking broadleaved tree species (Quercus 
      glauca and Cunninghamia lanceolata) and moso bamboo, dominating respectively in 
      uninvaded secondary broadleaved forest and bamboo forest formed after the 
      invasion as test materials, we investigated rhizosphere effect of plants on the 
      SOC mineralization in laboratory incubation experiments. The results showed that 
      carbon mineralization rates of Phyllostachys edulis (PE), Quercus glauca (QG) and 
      Cunninghamia lanceolata (CL) rhizosphere soils were 20%, 26%, and 21% higher than 
      bulk soils, respectively. Carbon mineralization of bulk soils of QG and CL was 
      22% and 26% higher, while that of rhizosphere soils was 14% and 11% higher than 
      PE, respectively. The contents of water-soluble organic carbon and organic carbon 
      in rhizosphere soils of the three species were significantly higher than those of 
      bulk soil, and the abundance of rhizosphere soil bacteria was higher than that of 
      non-rhizosphere. The contents of microbial biomass carbon, water-soluble organic 
      carbon, and total nitrogen were important factors influencing carbon 
      mineralization in rhizosphere, while water-soluble organic carbon and microbial 
      metabolic quotient were important factors influencing carbon mineralization in 
      non-rhizosphere. On the whole, the rhizosphere effect increased total SOC 
      mineralization, driving by changes in microbial biomass carbon, water-soluble 
      organic carbon, and total nitrogen content. The results could provide a 
      theoretical basis for plant-soil interaction on soil carbon cycling in bamboo 
      invasion habitats.

TI  - Aureobasidium pullulans Treatment Mitigates Drought Stress in Abies koreana via 
      Rhizosphere Microbiome Modulation.
LID - 10.3390/plants12203653 [doi]
LID - 3653
AB  - The Korean fir tree Abies koreana, an endangered species in Korea, faces threats 
      primarily from climate change-induced stress and drought. This study proposed a 
      sustainable method to enhance A. koreana drought tolerance using a black 
      yeast-like fungus identified as Aureobasidium pullulans (AK10). The 16S/ITS 
      metabarcoding analysis assessed the impact of drought and AK10 treatment on the 
      seedlings' rhizosphere microbiome. Results revealed a profound drought influence 
      on the microbiome, particularly affecting fungal mycobiota. Drought-stressed 
      seedlings exhibited elevated Agaricaceae levels, opportunistic fungi generally 
      associated with decomposition. AK10 treatment significantly mitigated this 
      proliferation and increased the relative abundance of beneficial fungi like 
      Cystofilobasidium and Mortierella, known biocontrol agents and phosphate 
      solubilizers. A notable reduction in the phytopathogenic Fusarium levels was 
      observed with AK10, alongside an increase in beneficial bacteria, including 
      Azospirillum and Nitrospirillum. Furthermore, the conducted correlation analysis 
      shed light on microbial interrelationships within the rhizosphere, elucidating 
      potential co-associations and antagonisms. Taken together, the isolated A. 
      pullulans AK10 identified in this study serves as a potential biostimulant, 
      enhancing the drought tolerance in A. koreana through beneficial alterations in 
      the rhizosphere microbiome. This approach presents a promising strategy for the 
      conservation of this endangered species.

TI  - Unveiling the complexity of strigolactones: exploring structural diversity, 
      biosynthesis pathways, and signaling mechanisms.
PG  - 1134-1147
LID - 10.1093/jxb/erad412 [doi]
AB  - Strigolactone is the collective name for compounds containing a butenolide as a 
      part of their structure, first discovered as compounds that induce seed 
      germination of root parasitic plants. They were later found to be rhizosphere 
      signaling molecules that induce hyphal branching of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi, 
      and, finally, they emerged as a class of plant hormones. Strigolactones are found 
      in root exudates, where they display a great variability in their chemical 
      structure. Their structure varies among plant species, and multiple 
      strigolactones can exist in one species. Over 30 strigolactones have been 
      identified, yet the chemical structure of the strigolactone that functions as an 
      endogenous hormone and is found in the above-ground parts of plants remains 
      unknown. We discuss our current knowledge of the synthetic pathways of diverse 
      strigolactones and their regulation, as well as recent progress in identifying 
      strigolactones as plant hormones. Strigolactone is perceived by the DWARF14 
      (D14), receptor, an alpha/beta hydrolase which originated by gene duplication of 
      KARRIKIN INSENSITIVE 2 (KAI2). D14 and KAI2 signaling pathways are partially 
      overlapping paralogous pathways. Progress in understanding the signaling 
      mechanisms mediated by two alpha/beta hydrolase receptors as well as remaining 
      challenges in the field of strigolactone research are reviewed.

TI  - Does a decade of soil organic fertilization promote copper and zinc 
      phytoavailability? Evidence from a laboratory biotest with field-collected soil 
      samples.

AB  - Despite chronic contamination, long-term organic fertilization tends to decrease 
      copper (Cu) and zinc (Zn) availability in agricultural soils. Root activities of 
      crop plants can also induce substantial changes in rhizosphere chemistry and 
      consequently in the Cu and Zn availability in the rhizosphere. The balance 
      between these two drivers and the overall effect of organic fertilization on Cu 
      and Zn bioavailability to plants (i.e., phytoavailability) remains a matter of 
      debate. We assessed the effect of a decade of agronomically realistic organic 
      fertilization on Cu and Zn availability in the rhizosphere and their 
      phytoavailability. Using a laboratory biotest, Festuca arundinacea was exposed to 
      34 soil samples collected from three agricultural field trials that had received 
      no, mineral, or organic fertilization for a decade. Dissolved organic matter 
      (DOM) properties (i.e., concentration, aromaticity, and binding properties toward 
      Cu), pH, and Cu and Zn availability (i.e., total dissolved concentration and free 
      ionic activity) were determined in the rhizosphere solutions. Cu and Zn 
      phytoavailability was measured as the plant uptake flux. Contrary to bulk soils, 
      organic fertilization induced very few changes in the chemistry and Cu and Zn 
      availability in the rhizosphere solutions compared to no and mineral 
      fertilization. Consistently, Cu and Zn phytoavailability did not increase with 
      organic fertilization, but it was mostly driven by soil properties rather than by 
      fertilization. Despite increasing soil Cu and Zn contamination, a decade of soil 
      organic fertilization did not increase Cu and Zn phytoavailability, presumably 
      due to the root-mediated levelling of Cu and Zn availability in the rhizosphere.

TI  - Untapped rich microbiota of mangroves of Pakistan: diversity and community 
      compositions.
PG  - 595-612

AB  - The mangrove ecosystem is the world's fourth most productive ecosystem in terms 
      of service value and offering rich biological resources. Microorganisms play 
      vital roles in these ecological processes, thus researching the 
      mangroves-microbiota is crucial for a deeper comprehension of mangroves dynamics. 
      Amplicon sequencing that targeted V4 region of 16S rRNA gene was employed to 
      profile the microbial diversities and community compositions of 19 soil samples, 
      which were collected from the rhizosphere of 3 plant species (i.e., Avicennia 
      marina, Ceriops tagal, and Rhizophora mucronata) in the mangrove forests of 
      Lasbela coast, Pakistan. A total of 67 bacterial phyla were observed from three 
      mangroves species, and these taxa were classified into 188 classes, 453 orders, 
      759 families, and 1327 genera. We found that Proteobacteria (34.9-38.4%) and 
      Desulfobacteria (7.6-10.0%) were the dominant phyla followed by Chloroflexi 
      (6.6-7.3%), Gemmatimonadota (5.4-6.8%), Bacteroidota (4.3-5.5%), Planctomycetota 
      (4.4-4.9%) and Acidobacteriota (2.7-3.4%), Actinobacteriota (2.5-3.3%), and 
      Crenarchaeota (2.5-3.3%). After considering the distribution of taxonomic groups, 
      we prescribe that the distinctions in bacterial community composition and 
      diversity are ascribed to the changes in physicochemical attributes of the soil 
      samples (i.e., electrical conductivity (EC(e)), pH, total organic matter (OM), 
      total organic carbon (OC), available phosphorus (P), and extractable potassium 
      (CaCO(3)). The findings of this study indicated a high-level species diversity in 
      Pakistani mangroves. The outcomes may also aid in the development of effective 
      conservation policies for mangrove ecosystems, which have been hotspots for 
      anthropogenic impacts in Pakistan. To our knowledge, this is the first microbial 
      research from a Pakistani mangrove forest.

AB  - Understanding the bioaccumulation of silver-containing nanoparticles (Ag-NPs) 
      with different species, concentrations, and sizes in estuarine plants is critical 
      to their related environmental risk. Herein, the distribution of Ag-NPs in 
      tidewater, sediments, and plants (Scirpus triqueter) of field-constructed 
      mesocosm was investigated, where tidewater was exposed to Ag(0)-NPs and Ag(+) at 
      environmentally relevant concentrations. Particle number concentrations (PNCs) 
      and sizes of Ag-NPs with various species were analyzed using a multistep 
      selective dissolution method followed by the single-particle- inductively coupled 
      plasma mass spectrometry technique. After 30 days of exposure, more than half of 
      Ag(0)-NPs were dissolved to Ag(+) and about 1/4 of Ag(+) were transformed into 
      Ag(0)-/AgCl-NPs in tidewater. Ag-NPs in stems exposed to Ag(0)-NPs were found to 
      be dominated by metallic Ag, while Ag(+) exposure led to more Ag(2)S-NPs in 
      stems. In roots, 71% and 51% of Ag-NPs were found as Ag(2)S-NPs for Ag(0)-NPs and 
      Ag(+) treatment groups, respectively. Plant stems had a significantly higher 
      enrichment of Ag-NPs than roots. Based on both random forests and structure 
      equation models, it is suggested that salinity of tidewater can regulate 
      Ag(0)-NPs in tidewater indirectly by influencing AgCl-NPs in tidewater and 
      further affect the total PNCs of Ag-NPs in plant stems. Moreover, elevated 
      sulfate-reducing bacteria (SRB) result in more Ag(2)S-NPs in rhizosphere 
      sediments, thereby enhancing the bioaccumulation of Ag-NPs by roots.

AB  - Deciphering root exudate composition of soil-grown plants is considered a crucial 
      step to better understand plant-soil-microbe interactions affecting plant growth 
      performance. In this study, two genotypes of Zea mays L. (WT, rth3) differing in 
      root hair elongation were grown in the field in two substrates (sand, loam) in 
      custom-made, perforated columns inserted into the field plots. Root exudates were 
      collected at different plant developmental stages (BBCH 14, 19, 59, 83) using a 
      soil-hydroponic-hybrid exudation sampling approach. Exudates were characterized 
      by LC-MS based non-targeted metabolomics, as well as by photometric assays 
      targeting total dissolved organic carbon, soluble carbohydrates, proteins, amino 
      acids, and phenolics. Results showed that plant developmental stage was the main 
      driver shaping both the composition and quantity of exuded compounds. Carbon (C) 
      exudation per plant increased with increasing biomass production over time, while 
      C exudation rate per cm(2) root surface area h(-1) decreased with plant maturity. 
      Furthermore, exudation rates were higher in the substrate with lower nutrient 
      mobility (i.e., loam). Surprisingly, we observed higher exudation rates in the 
      root hairless rth3 mutant compared to the root hair-forming WT sibling, though 
      exudate metabolite composition remained similar. Our results highlight the impact 
      of plant developmental stage on the plant-soil-microbe interplay.

AB  - The interaction between soil microbes and plants has a significant effect on soil 
      microbial structure and function, as well as plant adaptability. However, the 
      effect of soil micro-organisms on ecological adaption and rapid growth of woody 
      bamboos remains unclear. Here, 16S rRNA and ITS rRNA genes of rhizosphere 
      micro-organisms were sequenced, and the soil properties of three different types 
      of Dendrocalamus sinicus were determined at the dormancy and germination stages 
      of rhizome buds. The result showed that each type of D. sinicus preferred to 
      absorb ammonia nitrogen (NH(4)(+)-N) rather than nitrate nitrogen (NO(3)(-)-N) 
      and required more NH(4)(+)-N at germination or rapid growth period than during 
      the dormancy period. In total, nitrogen fixation capacity of soil bacteria in the 
      straight type was significantly higher than that in the introduced straight type, 
      while the ureolysis capacity had an opposite trend. Saprophytic fungi were the 
      dominant fungal functional taxa in habitat soils of both straight and introduced 
      straight type. Our findings are of great significance in understanding how soil 
      microbes affect growth and adaptation of woody bamboos, but also for soil 
      management of bamboo forests in red soil.

      Streptomyces sp. in Bamboo Rhizosphere Soil.
PG  - 36333-36343
LID - 10.1021/acsomega.3c04954 [doi]
AB  - The increasing concern over multidrug resistance in pathogens has led to an 
      ongoing search for novel antibiotics derived from soil actinobacteria. In this 
      current investigation, actinobacteria were isolated from the rhizosphere of 
      bamboo plants collected within the Megamalai forest of the Western Ghats in the 
      Theni zone of Tamil Nadu, India. These actinobacteria were subjected to 
      characterization, and their growth conditions were optimized to enhance the 
      production of bioactive compounds. To assess antibacterial properties, the 
      isolated Actinobacteria underwent testing using the agar plug method. The strain 
      exhibiting notable antibacterial activity underwent further characterization 
      through 16s rRNA gene sequencing and subsequent phylogenetic analysis. Employing 
      response surface methodology (RSM), cultural conditions were fine-tuned. 
      Bioactive compounds were extracted from the culture medium using ethyl acetate, 
      and their antibacterial and antioxidant effects were evaluated through disc 
      diffusion and DPPH radical scavenging methods, respectively. Ethyl acetate 
      extracts were analyzed by using FT-IR and GC-MS techniques. In total, nine 
      strains of Actinobacteria were isolated from the rhizosphere soil of bamboo. 
      Among these, strain BS-16 displayed remarkable antibacterial activity against 
      three strains: Staphylococcus aureus (19 mm), Bacillus subtilis (12 mm), and 
      Streptococcus pyogenes (10 mm). This strain was identified as Streptomyces sp. 
      The optimal conditions for bioactive compound production were determined as 
      follows: malt extract (10 g), yeast extract (5 g), dextrose (5 g), pH 6.5, and 
      temperature 30  degrees C. After a 7-day incubation period, the results showed a 6% 
      increase in production. The ethyl acetate fraction derived from strain BS-16 
      exhibited dose-dependent antibacterial and antioxidant activities. FT-IR and 
      GC-MS analyses revealed the presence of active compounds with antibacterial 
      effects within the extract. Consequently, further investigation into the BS-16 
      strain holds promise for scaling up the production of bioactive compounds 
      possessing antibacterial and antioxidant properties.

AB  - Abiotic factors and rhizosphere microbial populations influence arsenic 
      accumulation in rice grains. Although mineral and organic surfaces are keystones 
      in element cycling, localization of specific microbial reactions in the 
      root/soil/pore water system is still unclear. Here, we tested if original 
      unplanted soil, rhizosphere soil and pore water represented distinct ecological 
      microniches for arsenic-, sulfur- and iron-cycling microorganisms and compared 
      the influence of relevant factors such as soil type, sulfate fertilization and 
      cultivation time. In rice open-air-mesocosms with two paddy soils (2.0% and 4.7% 
      organic carbon), Illumina 16S rRNA gene sequencing demonstrated minor effects of 
      cultivation time and sulfate fertilization that decreased Archaea-driven 
      microbial networks and incremented sulfate-reducing and sulfur-oxidizing 
      bacteria. Different compartments, characterized by different bacterial and 
      archaeal compositions, had the strongest effect, with higher microbial 
      abundances, bacterial biodiversity and interconnections in the rhizosphere vs 
      pore water. Within each compartment, a significant soil type effect was observed. 
      Higher percentage contributions of rhizosphere dissimilatory arsenate- and 
      iron-reducing, arsenite-oxidizing, and, surprisingly, dissimilatory 
      sulfate-reducing bacteria, as well as pore water iron-oxidizing bacteria in the 
      lower organic carbon soil, supported previous chemistry-based interpretations of 
      a more active S-cycling, a higher percentage of thioarsenates and lower arsenic 
      mobility by sorption to mixed Fe(II)Fe(III)-minerals in this soil.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Continuous monoculture leading to soil nutrient depletion may cause 
      a decline in plantation productivity. Cow dung is typically used as a cheap 
      renewable resource to improve soil nutrient status. In this study, our purpose 
      was to compare the effects of different cow dung return methods (direct return 
      and carbonization return) on soil microbial communities and phosphorus 
      availability in the root zone (rhizosphere soil and non-rhizosphere soil) of 
      P.euphratica seedlings in forest gardens and to explore possible chemical and 
      microbial mechanisms. METHODS: Field experiments were conducted. Two-year-old 
      P.euphratica seedlings were planted in the soil together with 7.5 t hm(-2) of cow 
      dung and biochar made from the same amount of cow dung. RESULTS: Our findings 
      indicated that the available phosphorus content in soil subjected to biochar 
      treatment was considerably greater than that directly treated with cow dung, 
      leading to an increase in the phosphorus level of both aboveground and 
      underground components of P.euphratica seedlings. The content of Olsen-P in 
      rhizosphere and non-rhizosphere soil increased by 134% and 110%, 
      respectively.This was primarily a result of the direct and indirect impact of 
      biochar on soil characteristics. Biochar increased the biodiversity of 
      rhizosphere and non-rhizosphere soil bacteria compared with the direct return of 
      cow dung. The Shannon diversity index of carbonized cow manure returning to field 
      is 1.11 times and 1.10 times of that of direct cow manure returning to field and 
      control, and the Chao1 diversity index is 1.20 times and 1.15 times of that of 
      direct cow manure returning to field and control.Compared to the direct addition 
      of cow dung, the addition of biochar increased the copy number of the phosphorus 
      functional genes phoC and pqqc in the rhizosphere soil. In the biochar treatment, 
      the abundance of the phosphate-solubilizing bacteria Sphingomonas and 
      Lactobacillus was significantly higher than that in the other treatments, it is 
      relative abundance was 4.83% and 2.62%, respectively, which indirectly improved 
      soil phosphorus availability. DISCUSSION: The results indicated that different 
      cow dung return methods may exert different effects on phosphorus availability in 
      rhizosphere and non-rhizosphere soils via chemical and microbial pathways. These 
      findings indicated that, compared to the direct return of cow dung, biochar 
      return may exert a more significant impact on the availability of phosphorus in 
      both rhizosphere and non-rhizosphere soils, as well as on the growth of 
      P.euphratica seedlings and the microbial community.

TI  - Microbial controls over soil priming effects under chronic nitrogen and 
      phosphorus additions in subtropical forests.
PG  - 2160-2168

AB  - The soil priming effect (PE), defined as the modification of soil organic matter 
      decomposition by labile carbon (C) inputs, is known to influence C storage in 
      terrestrial ecosystems. However, how chronic nutrient addition, particularly in 
      leguminous and non-leguminous forests, will affect PE through interaction with 
      nutrient (e.g., nitrogen and phosphorus) availability is still unclear. 
      Therefore, we collected soils from leguminous and non-leguminous subtropical 
      plantations across a suite of historical nutrient addition regimes. We added 
      (13)C-labeled glucose to investigate how background soil nutrient conditions and 
      microbial communities affect priming and its potential microbial mechanisms. 
      Glucose addition increased soil organic matter decomposition and prompted 
      positive priming in all soils, regardless of dominant overstory tree species or 
      fertilizer treatment. In non-leguminous soil, only combined nitrogen and 
      phosphorus addition led to a higher positive priming than the control. 
      Conversely, soils beneath N-fixing leguminous plants responded positively to P 
      addition alone, as well as to joint NP addition compared to control. Using DNA 
      stable-isotope probing, high-throughput quantitative PCR, enzyme assays and 
      microbial C substrate utilization, we found that positive PE was associated with 
      increased microbial C utilization, accompanied by an increase in microbial 
      community activity, nutrient-related gene abundance, and enzyme activities. Our 
      findings suggest that the balance between soil available N and P effects on the 
      PE,  was dependent on rhizosphere microbial community composition. Furthermore, 
      these findings highlight the roles of the interaction between plants and their 
      symbiotic microbial communities in affecting soil priming and improve our 
      understanding of the potential microbial pathways underlying soil PEs.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Paeonia ludlowii is a rare and endangered plant species with a high 
      application value. However, its low cultivation success rate in China has 
      severely limited its protection, development, and utilization. In addition to 
      natural factors, microorganisms in the rhizosphere play an important role in 
      determining its cultivation success. METHODS: In this study, growth indexes and 
      soil physicochemical properties of both wild (origin: Nyingchi) and cultivated 
      (introduction: Luanchuan) species of P. ludlowii were measured during the 
      flowering, fruiting, and autumn foliage stages. ITS high-throughput sequencing 
      technology was employed to detect rhizosphere soil fungi, and the diversity, 
      community structure, functional prediction, molecular network, and ecological 
      processes of the microbial community assembly were examined by multidirectional 
      analysis. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: The results indicated that: both wild and 
      cultivated P. ludlowii species were able to flower and fruit normally, although 
      the wild species had a higher number of flowers and fruits and higher soil 
      available phosphorus and available potassium contents than those of the 
      cultivated species. Ascomycota and Basidiomycota were the dominant rhizosphere 
      soil fungal phyla in both P. ludlowii species. However, our network analysis 
      showed that Ascomycota as the key fungal phylum of the wild species, whereas the 
      cultivated species lacked key fungi. The community assembly mechanisms of 
      rhizosphere soil fungi in both wild and cultivated species were primarily 
      stochasticity, with no significant differences between them. Based on the results 
      of FUNGuild and molecular network analyses, cultivated species had a higher 
      proportion of fungi, such as Soil Saprotroph, that can easily cause diseases. 
      Additionally, the network connections among fungi were weaker in the cultivated 
      species than those in the wild species, which increased the cultivated species 
      susceptibility to external environmental interferences. Therefore, from a soil 
      microorganism perspective, this study suggests that, after the introduction and 
      cultivation of P. ludlowii, if rhizosphere soil fungi fail to gradually form a 
      close network relationship and instead promote the growth of pathogenic fungi, 
      the fungal ecosystem would become vulnerable.

TI  - Integrating the Soil Microbiota and Metabolome Reveals the Mechanism through 
      Which Controlled Release Fertilizer Affects Sugarcane Growth.

AB  - Root-soil underground interactions mediated by soil microorganisms and 
      metabolites are crucial for fertilizer utilization efficiency and crop growth 
      regulation. This study employed a combined approach of soil microbial community 
      profiling and non-targeted metabolomics to investigate the patterns of 
      root-associated microbial aggregation and the mechanisms associated with 
      metabolites under varying controlled-release fertilizer (CRF) application rates. 
      The experimental treatments included five field application rates of CRF (D1: 675 
      kg/ha; D15: 1012.5 kg/ha; D2: 1350 kg/ha; D25: 1687.5 kg/ha; and D3: 2025 kg/ha) 
      along with traditional fertilizer as a control (CK: 1687.5 kg/ha). The results 
      indicated that the growth of sugarcane in the field was significantly influenced 
      by the CRF application rate (p < 0.05). Compared with CK, the optimal field 
      application of CRF was observed at D25, resulting in a 16.3% to 53.6% increase in 
      sugarcane yield. Under the condition of reducing fertilizer application by 20%, 
      D2 showed a 13.3% increase in stem yield and a 6.7% increase in sugar production. 
      The bacterial ACE index exhibited significant differences between D25 and D1, 
      while the Chao1 index showed significance among the D25, D1, and CK treatments. 
      The dominant bacterial phyla in sugarcane rhizosphere aggregation included 
      Proteobacteria, Actinobacteriota, and Acidobacteriota. Fungal phyla comprised 
      Rozellomycota, Basidiomycota, and Ascomycota. The annotated metabolic pathways 
      encompassed biosynthesis of secondary metabolites, carbohydrate metabolism, and 
      lipid metabolism. Differential analysis and random forest selection identified 
      distinctive biomarkers including Leotiomycetes, Cercospora, Anaeromyxobacter, 
      isoleucyl-proline, and methylmalonic acid. Redundancy analysis unveiled soil pH, 
      soil organic carbon, and available nitrogen as the primary drivers of microbial 
      communities, while the metabolic profiles were notably influenced by the 
      available potassium and phosphorus. The correlation heatmaps illustrated 
      potential microbial-metabolite regulatory mechanisms under CRF application 
      conditions. These findings underscore the significant potential of CRF in 
      sugarcane field production, laying a theoretical foundation for sustainable 
      development in the sugarcane industry.

AB  - This study explored the composition of the mycobiome in the rhizosphere of Inga 
      seedlings in two different but neighboring forest ecosystems in the undisturbed 
      tropical Amazon rainforest at the Tiputini Biodiversity Station in Ecuador. In 
      terra firme plots, which were situated higher up and therefore typically outside 
      of the influence of river floods, and in varzea plots, the lower part of the 
      forest located near the riverbanks and therefore seasonally flooded, tree 
      seedlings of the genus Inga were randomly collected and measured, and the 
      rhizosphere soils surrounding the root systems was collected. Members of the 
      Fabaceae family and the genus Inga were highly abundant in both forest 
      ecosystems. Inga sp. seedlings collected in terra firme showed a lower shoot to 
      root ratio compared to seedlings that were collected in varzea, suggesting that 
      Inga seedlings which germinated in varzea soils could invest more resources in 
      vegetative growth with shorter roots. Results of the physical-chemical properties 
      of soil samples indicated higher proportions of N, Mo, and V in terra firme 
      soils, whereas varzea soils present higher concentrations of all other macro- and 
      micronutrients, which confirmed the nutrient deposition effect of seasonal 
      flooding by the nearby river. ITS metabarcoding was used to explore the mycobiome 
      associated with roots of the genus Inga. Bioinformatic analysis was performed 
      using Qiime 2 to calculate the alpha and beta diversity, species taxonomy and the 
      differential abundance of fungi and arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi. The fungal 
      community represented 75% of the total ITS ASVs, and although present in all 
      samples, the subphylum Glomeromycotina represented 1.42% of all ITS ASVs with 
      annotations to 13 distinct families, including Glomeraceae (72,23%), 
      Gigasporaceae (0,57%), Acaulosporaceae (0,49%). AMF spores of these three AMF 
      families were morphologically identified by microscopy. Results of this study 
      indicate that AMF surround the rhizosphere of Inga seedlings in relatively low 
      proportions compared to other fungal groups but present in both terra firme and 
      varzea Neotropical ecosystems.

TI  - Plant growth promoting activities of Pseudomonas sp. and Enterobacter sp. 
      isolated from the rhizosphere of Vachellia gummifera in Morocco.
LID - fiad114 [pii]
LID - 10.1093/femsec/fiad114 [doi]
AB  - The Moroccan endemic Vachellia gummifera grows wild under extreme desert 
      conditions. This plant could be used as an alternative fodder for goats, and 
      camels, in order to protect the Argan forests against overgrazing in Central and 
      Southwestern Moroccan semiarid areas. With the aim to improve the V. gummifera 
      population's density in semiarid areas, we proposed its inoculation with 
      performing plant growth-promoting bacteria. Hence, 500 bacteria were isolated 
      from the plant rhizosphere. From these, 291 isolates were retained for plant 
      growth-promoting (PGP) activities assessment. A total of 44 isolates showed the 
      best phosphates solubilization potential, as well as siderophore and auxin 
      production. The combination of REP-PCR (repetitive extragenic 
      palindromic-polymerase chain reaction) fingerprinting, PGP activities, and 
      phenotypic properties, allowed the selection of three strains for the inoculation 
      experiments. The three selected strains' 16S rRNA sequencing showed that they are 
      members of the Enterobacter and Pseudomonas genera. The inoculation with three 
      strains had diverse effects on V. gummifera growth parameters. All single and 
      combined inoculations improved the plant shoot weight by more than 200%, and the 
      root length by up to 139%, while some combinations further improved protein and 
      chlorophyll content, thereby improving the plant's forage value. The three 
      selected strains constitute an effective inoculum for use in the arid and 
      semiarid zones of southern Morocco.

AB  - Our aim was to test if ecological stages may influence the arbuscular mycorrhizal 
      fungi (AMF), nematodes, and the soil chemical properties in agroforestry systems 
      (AF), unassisted forest restoration (UFR), and natural ecosystem (Ne) located in 
      the Brazilian Tropical and Subtropical regions. We collected soil samples to 
      determine AMF, nematodes, soil pH, P, and soil organic carbon (SOC). AMF and 
      nematode richness in the AF and Ne were similar in the tropical region. The 
      redundancy analysis (RDA) indicated that the abundance of AMF and soil nematodes 
      was mainly affected by soil pH, P, and SOC. Differences were associated with (1) 
      ecological stages, as we found differences in AMF and nematode abundance as 
      affected by habitat simplification, and (2) changes in soil pH, SOC, and P. Our 
      work increases the understanding of the AMF and soil nematode community in the 
      rhizosphere of AF and Ne in tropical and subtropical regions.

AB  - King grass has been recognized as a potential phytoremediation plant species due 
      to its high biomass and resistance to heavy metals (HMs). However, the possible 
      impacts of cadmium (Cd) contamination on rhizocompartments' microbial activities 
      in association with king grass have not been extensively explored. The 
      utilization of 16S rRNA gene and ITS sequencing was carried out to examine 
      alterations in the bacterial and fungal communities in the rhizosphere and 
      rhizoplane of king grass in response to low and high Cd stress. Results 
      demonstrated that both bacterial and fungal communities' diversity and richness 
      were negatively impacted by Cd stress, regardless of its concentration. However, 
      evenness did not exhibit any significant response to either of the 
      concentrations. Additionally, nonmetric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) 
      ordination demonstrated a significant difference (p < 0.001) in microbial 
      communities under different treatments. The abundance of bacterial taxa such as 
      Steroibacter, Nitrospira, Pseudoxanthomonas, Cellvirio, Phenylobacterium, 
      Mycobacterium, Pirellula and Aquicella was adversely affected under Cd stress 
      while Flavobacterium, Gemmata, Thiobacillus and Gemmatimonas showed no prominent 
      response, indicating their resistance to Cd stress. Like that, certain fungal 
      taxa for instance, Cladosporium, Cercophora, Acremonium, Mortierella, 
      Aspergillus, Penicillium, Glomus and Sebacina were also highly reduced by low and 
      high Cd stress. In contrast, Fusarium, Thanatephorus, Botrytis and Curvularia did 
      not show any response to Cd stress. The identified taxa may have a crucial role 
      in the growth of king grass under heavy metal contamination, making them 
      promising candidates for developing bioinoculants to encourage plant performance 
      and phytoremediation capability in HM-contaminated soils.

TI  - Nitrogen fertilization promoted microbial growth and N(2)O emissions by 
      increasing the abundance of nirS and nosZ denitrifiers in semiarid maize field.
PG  - 1265562

AB  - Nitrous oxide (N(2)O) emissions are a major source of gaseous nitrogen loss, 
      causing environmental pollution. The low organic content in the Loess Plateau 
      region, coupled with the high fertilizer demand of maize, further exacerbates 
      these N losses. N fertilizers play a primary role in N(2)O emissions by 
      influencing soil denitrifying bacteria, however, the underlying microbial 
      mechanisms that contribute to N(2)O emissions have not been fully explored. 
      Therefore, the research aimed to gain insights into the intricate relationships 
      between N fertilization, soil denitrification, N(2)O emissions, potential 
      denitrification activity (PDA), and maize nitrogen use efficiency (NUE) in 
      semi-arid regions. Four nitrogen (N) fertilizer rates, namely N0, N1, N2, and N3 
      (representing 0, 100, 200, and 300 kg ha(-1) yr.(-1), respectively) were applied 
      to maize field. The cumulative N(2)O emissions were 32 and 33% higher under N2 
      and 37 and 39% higher under N3 in the 2020 and 2021, respectively, than the N0 
      treatment. N fertilization rates impacted the abundance, composition, and network 
      of soil denitrifying communities (nirS and nosZ) in the bulk and rhizosphere 
      soil. Additionally, within the nirS community, the genera Cupriavidus and 
      Rhodanobacter were associated with N(2)O emissions. Conversely, in the nosZ 
      denitrifier, the genera Azospirillum, Mesorhizobium, and Microvirga in the bulk 
      and rhizosphere soil reduced N(2)O emissions. Further analysis using both random 
      forest and structural equation model (SEM) revealed that specific soil properties 
      (pH, NO(3)(-)-N, SOC, SWC, and DON), and the presence of nirS-harboring 
      denitrification, were positively associated with PDA activities, respectively, 
      and exhibited a significant association to N(2)O emissions and PDA activities but 
      expressed a negative effect on maize NUE. However, nosZ-harboring denitrification 
      showed an opposite trend, suggesting different effects on these variables. Our 
      findings suggest that N fertilization promoted microbial growth and N(2)O 
      emissions by increasing the abundance of nirS and nosZ denitrifiers and altering 
      the composition of their communities. This study provides new insights into the 
      relationships among soil microbiome, maize productivity, NUE, and soil N(2)O 
      emissions in semi-arid regions.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Panax ginseng cultivated under the forest is popular because its 
      shape and effective ingredients are similar to wild ginseng. The growth of P. 
      ginseng in the larch forest is generally better than in the broad-leaved forest, 
      and the incidence rate of diseases is low. Therefore, the selection of forest 
      species is one of the basic factors in the successful cropping of P. ginseng. 
      METHODS: Illumina HiSeq high-throughput sequencing was used to analyze the 16S 
      rRNA/ITS gene sequence of P. ginseng rhizosphere soil under larch forest to study 
      the rhizosphere microbiome's diversity and community composition structure. 
      RESULTS: The species classification and richness of rhizosphere bacterial and 
      fungal communities in the same-aged P. ginseng were similar. Consistent with the 
      soil system of commonly cultivated crops, Proteobacteria, Actinobacteriota, 
      Acidobacteriota, Verrucomicrobiota, Chloroflexi, and Basidiomycota, Ascomycota 
      were the dominant phylum of bacteria and fungi, respectively. Compared with the 
      soil without planting P. ginseng, the diversity of microorganisms and community 
      structure of continuous planting for 2 years, 5 years, and 18 years of P. ginseng 
      rhizosphere soil had little change. The accumulation levels of Ilyonectria, 
      Fusarium, Gibberella, and Cylindrocarpon were not significantly increased with 
      planting P. ginseng and the increased age of cropping P. ginseng. CONCLUSIONS: 
      The results of this study showed that the soil function of the larch forest was 
      good, which provided a theoretical basis for the land selection and soil 
      improvement of cultivating P. ginseng under the larch forest.

TI  - Effects of warming on fine root lifespan of forests: A review.
PG  - 1693-1702
LID - 10.13287/j.1001-9332.202306.007 [doi]
AB  - As an important parameter of forests growth, fine root lifespan plays an 
      important role in plant water and nutrient absorption, and affects underground 
      distribution of photosynthetic products and forest ecosystem carbon cycling. The 
      impact of climate warming on fine root lifespan has become a hot issue under the 
      context of global change. The responses of fine root lifespan to global warming 
      will affect ecosystem carbon balance. We reviewed the research progress of the 
      response characteristics and mechanism of fine root lifespan of trees to warming. 
      Most stu-dies proposed that warming would affect fine root lifespan by changing 
      rhizosphere soil environment, fine root morphology, and tree phenology. However, 
      the growth and death of fine roots were affected by lots of factors, leading to 
      differences in the research results on fine root lifespan due to natural 
      environment of the study area, the way of warming, and the research objects. 
      Therefore, it is of importance to comprehensively analyze the responses of fine 
      root lifespan in forests under the background of climate warming to study the 
      underground ecological process. In the future, the following research should be 
      strengthened: 1) Combining multiple methods to warming underground and 
      aboveground simutaneously, and explore more accurate and effective 
      non-destructive observation methods. 2) Combining multiple observations to study 
      the effects of warming on fine root lifespan. 3) Carrying out research on the 
      effect of warming on fine root lifespan of different tree species, and deeply 
      understand the response mechanism of fine root lifespan of different trees to 
      warming. 4) A comprehensive analysis of the effects of warming on fine root 
      lifespan from various perspectives, and an investigation into the mechanism of 
      the combined effects of various factors on fine root lifespan. 5) The interaction 
      between warming and other environmental factors fine root lifespan. 6) The effect 
      of root architecture on the fine root lifespan after warming. 7) The effects of 
      rhizosphere microorganisms (bacteria and fungi) on fine root lifespan after 
      warming.

TI  - Responses of rhizosphere fungi to the root economics space in grassland 
      monocultures of different age.

AB  - Recent studies on root traits have shown that there are two axes explaining trait 
      variation belowground: the collaboration axis with mycorrhizal partners and the 
      conservation ('fast - slow') axis. However, it is yet unknown whether these trait 
      axes affect the assembly of soilborne fungi. We expect saprotrophic fungi to link 
      to the conservation axis of root traits, whereas pathogenic and arbuscular 
      mycorrhizal fungi link to the collaboration axis, but in opposite directions, as 
      arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi might provide pathogen protection. To test these 
      hypotheses, we sequenced rhizosphere fungal communities and measured root traits 
      in monocultures of 25 grassland plant species, differing in age. Within the 
      fungal guilds, we evaluated fungal species richness, relative abundance and 
      community composition. Contrary to our hypotheses, fungal diversity and relative 
      abundance were not strongly related to the root trait axes. However, saprotrophic 
      fungal community composition was affected by the conservation gradient and 
      pathogenic community composition by the collaboration gradient. The rhizosphere 
      AMF community composition did not change along the collaboration gradient, even 
      though the root trait axis was in line with the root mycorrhizal colonization 
      rate. Overall, our results indicate that in the long term, the root trait axes 
      are linked with fungal community composition.

TI  - Reductive soil disinfestation and Fe amendment improve soil microbial composition 
      and Fritillaria production.

AB  - The continuous obstacles of cropping cause severe economic loss, which seriously 
      threaten agricultural sustainable development. In addition, managing excess 
      waste, such as potato peel and mineral waste residues, is a vital burden for 
      industry and agriculture. Therefore, we explored the feasibility of reductive 
      soil disinfestation (RSD) with potato peel and amendment with iron mineral waste 
      residues for the production of Fritillaria thunbergii, which is vulnerable to 
      continuous obstacles. In this study, the influences of iron mineral, RSD with 
      different organic maters, as well as the combined effects of iron mineral and RSD 
      on Fritillaria rhizosphere soil physicochemical properties, microbial 
      communities, and Fritillaria production were investigated. The results revealed 
      that the RSD treatments with potato peel significantly reduced the soil salinity 
      and increased the soil pH, microbial activity, organic matter, and the contents 
      of K and Ca. RSD with potato peel also significantly thrived of the beneficial 
      microbes (Bacillus, Azotobacter, Microvirga, and Chaetomium), and down-regulated 
      potential plant pathogens. RSD with potato peel significantly promoted F. 
      thunbergii yield and quality. Moreover, the combined effects of RSD and iron 
      mineral amendment further enhanced soil health, improved microbial community 
      composition, and increased the yield and peimisine content of F. thunbergii by 
      24.2% and 49.3%, respectively. Overall, our results demonstrated that RSD with 
      potato peel and amendment with iron mineral waste residues can efficiently 
      improve soil fertility, modify the microbial community, and benefit for both the 
      sustainable production of F. thunbergii and the management of waste. KEY POINTS: 
      * RSD increases soil pH, organic matter, microbial activity, and mineral content 
      * RSD with potato peel enriches beneficial microbes and decreases plant pathogens 
      * PP + Fe treatment increases Fritillaria yield by 24.2% and peimisine content by 
      49.3.

TI  - Differences in Juniperus przewalskii Rhizosphere Microbiomes across Age Classes: 
      Community Diversity and Assembly.
LID - 10.3390/microorganisms11082094 [doi]
LID - 2094
AB  - Evidence shows that biotic and abiotic factors have apparent diversity at 
      different forest ages, leading to changes in rhizosphere microbiomes. However, 
      the difference in diversity, co-occurrence pattern, and assembly of the 
      rhizosphere microbial community among the different forest ages is still unclear. 
      A total of 24 Juniperus przewalskii rhizosphere soil samples were selected from 
      four representative age classes, using diameter at breast height (DBH) as a proxy 
      for tree age (age class I: 5 < DBH </= 12.5 cm, age class II: 12.5 < DBH </= 22.5 cm, 
      age class III: 22.5 < DBH </= 32.5 cm, and age class IV: DBH > 32.5 cm), and 
      analyzed the structural characteristics of the soil microbial community by 
      high-throughput amplicon sequencing. With the increase in age class, the 
      microbial community alpha-diversity and beta-diversity had an increased trend. The 
      bacterial Shannon index in class II and class III were markedly higher than in 
      class I. From class I to class IV, the relative abundances of dominant phyla such 
      as Actinobacteria and Ascomycota decreased, and the relative abundances of 
      Proteobacteria and Basidiomycota increased in contrast. The complexity and 
      association stability of the bacteria and fungi community network structure 
      increase with forest age. Stochastic processes mediated the assembly of soil 
      bacterial communities, while deterministic processes played a more significant 
      role in the assembly of fungal communities. In addition, the relative importance 
      of deterministic components in the microbial community increased significantly 
      with age class. Random forests suggested that soil pH, plant Shannon-Wiener index 
      (H), and Pielou's evenness index (J) were the most important driving factors of 
      bacterial and fungal community assembly. Overall, these results provide 
      information useful for understanding the generation and maintenance mechanisms of 
      rhizosphere microbial communities across age classes.

AB  - Rhizosphere microbial communities can influence plant growth and development. 
      Natural regeneration processes take place in the tree stands of protected areas, 
      which makes it possible to observe the natural changes taking place in the 
      rhizosphere along with the development of the plants. This study aimed to 
      determine the diversity (taxonomic and functional) of the rhizosphere fungal 
      communities of Norway spruce growing in one of four developmental stages. Our 
      research was based on the ITS region using Illumina system sequencing. 
      Saprotrophs dominated in the studied rhizospheres, but their percentage share 
      decreased with the age of the development group (for 51.91 from 43.13%). However, 
      in the case of mycorrhizal fungi, an opposite trend was observed (16.96-26.75%). 
      The most numerous genera were: saprotrophic Aspergillus (2.54-3.83%), Penicillium 
      (6.47-12.86%), Pyrenochaeta (1.39-11.78%), pathogenic Curvularia (0.53-4.39%), 
      and mycorrhizal Cortinarius (1.80-5.46%), Pseudotomentella (2.94-5.64%) and 
      Tomentella (4.54-15.94%). The species composition of rhizosphere fungal 
      communities was favorable for the regeneration of natural spruce and the 
      development of multi-generational Norway spruce stands. The ratio of the 
      abundance of saprotrophic and mycorrhizal fungi to the abundance of pathogens was 
      high and promising for the durability of the large proportion of spruce in the 
      Wigry National Park and for forest ecosystems in general.

TI  - Biogeography of Fungal Communities Associated with Pinus sylvestris L. and Picea 
      abies (L.) H. Karst. along the Latitudinal Gradient in Europe.

AB  - We assessed the diversity and composition of fungal communities in different 
      functional tissues and the rhizosphere soil of Pinus sylvestris and Picea abies 
      stands along the latitudinal gradient of these tree species distributions in 
      Europe to model possible changes in fungal communities imposed by climate change. 
      For each tree species, living needles, shoots, roots, and the rhizosphere soil 
      were sampled and subjected to high-throughput sequencing. Results showed that the 
      latitude and the host tree species had a limited effect on the diversity and 
      composition of fungal communities, which were largely explained by the 
      environmental variables of each site and the substrate they colonize. The mean 
      annual temperature and mean annual precipitation had a strong effect on root 
      fungal communities, isothermality on needle fungal communities, mean temperature 
      of the warmest quarter and precipitation of the driest month on shoot fungal 
      communities, and precipitation seasonality on soil fungal communities. Fungal 
      communities of both tree species are predicted to shift to habitats with a lower 
      annual temperature amplitude and with increasing precipitation during the driest 
      month, but the suitability of these habitats as compared to the present 
      conditions is predicted to decrease in the future.

AB  - Within the supergroup Rotosphaeromycetes, or "Holomycota"/"Nucletmycea", there 
      are several well-recognised unicellular clades in the earliest diverging fungi 
      (EDF). However, we know little about their occurrence. Here, we investigated EDF 
      in the rhizosphere and bulk soils from cropland, forest, orchard, and wetland 
      ecosystems around the Beijing-Hebei area, China, to illustrate their niche and 
      ecosystem preference. More than 500 new operational taxonomic units (OTUs) of EDF 
      were detected based on the 18S rRNA genes. Microsporida and Aphelida constitute 
      dominant groups, whereas Rozellosporida was quite rare. Although the EDF 
      community was site-specific, the soil chemical characteristics, vegetation, and 
      other eukaryotic microorganisms were the key factors driving the occurrence of 
      EDF. Moreover, the stochastic process consisted the most of the EDF community 
      assembly.

TI  - Soilization utilization of solid waste: Ecological regulation of phosphorus 
      tailings-based soil with physicochemical improvement and 
      Bacillus_cereus-addition.

AB  - Extraction and utilization of effective phosphorus from solid waste have been an 
      important approach for alleviating phosphorus resource shortage. The extraction 
      of available phosphorus by microbial method with low cost, mild conditions and 
      simple process has been drawing attention from the majority of research scholars. 
      However, relevant studies on special microbial communities for effective 
      phosphorus extraction from solid waste are less. In this work，a functional 
      Bacillus_cereus strain screened from phosphate tailings, phosphate ore and forest 
      rhizosphere soil was inoculated into phosphate tailings (PT), modified phosphate 
      tailings (IS) and highland red soil (SS). Compared with SS, the water-holding 
      properties, fertility, leaching toxicity and microbial community diversity of PT 
      and IS with and without bacteria were analyzed. PT+, SS+ and IS+ (after adding 
      bacteria to PT, SS and IS) showed moderately alkaline pH, and the available 
      phosphorus content enhanced by 31.73%, 20.05% and 39.41% respectively. The 
      leaching toxicity phosphate of PT+ and IS + decreased by 4.89 mg/kg and 
      2.61 mg/kg respectively, while that of SS + increased by 5.45 mg/kg, indicating 
      differences in the phosphorus solubilization mechanism of Bacillus_cereus for 
      different soils. Furthermore, the modification and bacteria treatment improved 
      the relative abundance of Pedobacter, Alcaligenaceae and Pseudomonas, thus 
      enhancing the phosphorus solubility of the PT bacterial community. This work may 
      achieve efficient utilization and ecological restoration of phosphorus 
      tailings-based soil and contribute to long-term sustainable agricultural 
      development.

AB  - The relationship between iron manganese plaque (IP) and cadmium (Cd) accumulation 
      by rice in the microenvironment of rice rhizosphere at varying field scales needs 
      to be further explored. In this study, we selected different rice varieties and 
      implemented tailored amendments to ensure the safe production of rice grains in 
      heavily Cd-contaminated farmland situated around an E-waste dismantling site. 
      Through regional surveys, we elucidated the role of IP in facilitating safe rice 
      production. The selection of low-Cd accumulating rice varieties and application 
      of appropriate amendments with sufficient dosages allowed for the effective 
      reduction of Cd transport from soil to rice, resulting in a safe concentration of 
      Cd in rice grains. Analysis using a random forest algorithm indicated that iron 
      (Fe) played a more pivotal role than manganese in soil-rice systems in mitigating 
      Cd accumulation in brown rice. The presence of Fe in IP (IP-Fe) at a low loading 
      mass was unfavorable to the Cd-safe production of rice, while at an IP-Fe loading 
      mass of 52 g/kg, the Cd content in brown rice decreased to a safe level. 
      Furthermore, precipitation, coprecipitation, and complexation of surface 
      functional groups contributed to Cd fixation on IP, as indicated by scanning 
      electron microscopy coupled with energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, electron 
      probe microanalysis, and Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy with attenuated 
      total reflection. Our results highlighted the key role of IP in the production of 
      Cd-safe rice at different field scales.

AB  - Environmental variables shifted by climate change act as driving factors in 
      determining plant-associated microbial communities in terrestrial ecosystems. 
      However, how elevation-induced changes in soil properties shape the microbial 
      community in forest ecosystems remains less understood. Thus, the Pinus 
      tabuliformis forests at elevations of 1500 m, 1900 m, and 2300 m above sea level 
      were investigated to explore the effect of environmental factors on microbial 
      assemblage. Significant changes in the soil physicochemical properties were found 
      across the investigated elevations, such as soil moisture, temperature, pH, 
      nitrogen (N), and phosphorus (P). Soil enzymatic activities, including soil 
      sucrase, phosphatase, and dehydrogenase, were significantly affected by 
      elevation, and sucrase showed a linear correlation with soil organic matter. 
      Furthermore, the richness of fungal communities in the rhizosphere was decreased 
      as elevation increased, while a humpback pattern was found for roots. Certain 
      core microbiota members, such as Agaricomycetes, Leotiomycetes, and 
      Pezizomycetes, were crucial in maintaining a stable ecological niche in both the 
      root and rhizosphere. We also found that shifting of fungal communities in the 
      rhizosphere were more related to physical properties (e.g., pH, soil moisture, 
      and soil temperature), while changes in root fungal communities along elevation 
      gradient were related mostly to soil nutrients (e.g., soil N and P). Overall, 
      this study demonstrates that the assemblage of the root and rhizosphere fungal 
      communities in P. tabuliformis forest primarily depends on elevation-induced 
      changes in environmental variables and highlights the importance of predicting 
      fungal responses to future climate change.

TI  - Climate and Soil Microsite Conditions Determine Local Adaptation in Declining 
      Silver Fir Forests.

LID - 2607
AB  - Ongoing climatic change is threatening the survival of drought-sensitive tree 
      species, such as silver fir (Abies alba). Drought-induced dieback had been 
      previously explored in this conifer, although the role played by tree-level 
      genetic diversity and its relationship with growth patterns and soil microsite 
      conditions remained elusive. We used double digest restriction-site-associated 
      DNA sequencing (ddRADseq) to describe different genetic characteristics of five 
      silver fir forests in the Spanish Pyrenees, including declining and non-declining 
      trees. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were used to investigate the 
      relationships between genetics, dieback, intraspecific trait variation 
      (functional dendrophenotypic traits and leaf traits), local bioclimatic 
      conditions, and rhizosphere soil properties. While there were no noticeable 
      genetic differences between declining and non-declining trees, genome-environment 
      associations with selection signatures were abundant, suggesting a strong 
      influence of climate, soil physicochemical properties, and soil microbial 
      diversity on local adaptation. These results provide novel insights into how 
      genetics and diverse environmental factors are interrelated and highlight the 
      need to incorporate genetic data into silver fir forest dieback studies to gain a 
      better understanding of local adaptation.

TI  - Biochemical characterization and mycorrhizal fungal community of plant species in 
      the Brazilian seasonal dry forest.
PG  - 1242-1253
LID - 10.1002/jobm.202300269 [doi]
AB  - Invasive alien plant species (IAPS) have the ability to change the biochemical 
      properties and the arbuscular mycorrhizal fungal (AMF) community structure in 
      their rhizosphere. Organic acids, microbial activity, and AMF play a key role in 
      the invader's spread and also has interactions with the soil chemical factors. 
      Our aim here was to assess the rhizosphere's biochemical factors, AMF community 
      composition, and soil chemical properties associated with Cryptostegia 
      madagascariensis (IAPS) and Mimosa tenuiflora (endemic plant species) from the 
      Brazilian Seasonal Dry Forest. The highest values of total glomalin 
      (5.87 mg g(-1) soil), root colonization (54.5%), oxalic and malic acids (84.21 
      and 3.01 mumol g(-1) , respectively), microbial biomass C (mg kg(-1) ), Na(+) 
      (0.080 cmol(c)  kg(-1) ), Ca(2+) (7.04 cmol(c)  kg(-1) ), and soil organic carbon 
      (4.59 g kg(-1) ) were found in the rhizosphere of C. madagascariensis. We found 
      dissimilarities on AMF community structure considering the studied plant species: 
      (i) Racocetra coralloidea, Dentiscutata heterogama, Dentiscutata cerradensis, 
      Gigaspora decipiens, and AMF's richness were highly correlated with the 
      rhizosphere of M. tenuiflora; and (ii). The rhizosphere of C. madagascariensis 
      was highly correlated with the abundance of Claroideoglomus etunicatum, 
      Rhizoglomus aggregatum, Funneliformis mosseae, and Funneliformis geosporum. The 
      results of our study highlight the importance of considering C. madagascariensis 
      as potential hosts for AMF species from Glomerales, and a potential plant species 
      that increase the bioavailability of exchangeable Na and Ca at semi-arid 
      conditions.

TI  - Soil Bacterial Communities Across Seven Rhizoma Peanut Cultivars (Arachis 
      glabrata Benth.) Respond to Seasonal Variation.
PG  - 2703-2715
LID - 10.1007/s00248-023-02277-9 [doi]
AB  - Soil microorganisms play key roles in soil nutrient transformations and have a 
      notable effect on plant growth and health. Different plant genotypes can shape 
      soil microbial patterns via the secretion of root exudates and volatiles, but it 
      is uncertain how a difference in soil microorganisms induced by crop cultivars 
      will respond to short-term seasonal variations. A field experiment was conducted 
      to assess the changes in soil bacterial communities of seven rhizoma peanut 
      (Arachis glabrata Benth, RP) cultivars across two growing seasons, April (Spring 
      season) and October (Fall season). Soils' bacterial communities were targeted 
      using 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing. Bacterial community diversity and 
      taxonomic composition among rhizoma peanut cultivars were significantly affected 
      by seasons, cultivars, and their interactions (p < 0.05). Alpha diversity, as 
      estimated by the OTU richness and Simpson index, was around onefold decrease in 
      October than in April across most of the RP cultivars, while the soils from 
      Arblick and Latitude had around one time higher alpha diversity in both seasons 
      compared with other cultivars. Beta diversity differed significantly in April (R 
      = 0.073, p < 0.01) and October (R = 0.084, p < 0.01) across seven cultivars. 
      Bacterial dominant taxa (at phylum and genus level) were strongly affected by 
      seasons and varied towards more dominant groups that have functional potentials 
      involved in nutrient cycling from April to October. A large shift in water 
      availability induced by season variations in addition to host cultivar's effects 
      can explain the observed patterns in diversity, composition, and co-occurrence of 
      bacterial taxa. Overall, our results demonstrate an overriding effect of 
      short-term seasonal variations on soil bacterial communities associated with 
      different crop cultivars. The findings suggest that season-induced shifts in 
      environmental conditions could exert stronger impacts on soil microorganisms than 
      the finer-scale rhizosphere effect from crop cultivars, and consequently 
      influence largely microbe-mediated soil processes and crop health in agricultural 
      ecosystems.

AB  - Ratooning in sugarcane often leads to soil problems such as degradation, 
      acidification, and soil-borne diseases that negatively impact agriculture output 
      and sustainability. Understanding the alteration in bacterial communities, 
      activities, and their diversity connected to the plant and soil under consecutive 
      ratooning still needs to be clarified. To address this gap, multidisciplinary 
      approaches such as Illumina sequencing and measurement of soil nutrients and 
      enzymes were used in this study to analyze soil samples in a field with three 
      consecutive ratooning sugarcane crops. The results revealed a decline in crop 
      yield and significant changes (P < 0.05) in soil nutrients and bacterial 
      diversity. Ratooning resulted in an acidic environment that potentially affected 
      soil nutrients and enzyme activity responsible for the cycling of carbon, 
      nitrogen, and phosphorous. Non-metric dimensional scaling (NMDS) confirmed the 
      effect of ratooning on soil attributes. Moreover, a positive correlation between 
      soil physiochemical properties and soil enzymes was observed. Alpha diversity 
      indices indicated greater bacterial diversity in ratooning sugarcane. Bacterial 
      diversity varied throughout the ratooning crop, and significant (P < 0.05) 
      changes in the relative abundance of specific phyla were observed. For example, 
      the relative abundance of Proteobacteria was decreased, and Acidobacteria was 
      increased. Furthermore, the relative abundance of bacterial phyla was strongly 
      correlated with soil attributes (enzymes and nutrients). Additionally, ratooning 
      results in the depletion or enrichment of important agriculture microbial genera 
      such as Sphingomonas, Burkholderia, and Acidothermus (P < 0.05), respectively. In 
      conclusion, ratooning led to soil acidification, decreased fertility, and altered 
      microbial structure and activity. Thus, restraining soil acidity by means of 
      liming or biofertilizers to maintain soil nutrients, enzymatic activities, and 
      microbial structure could benefit plants and soil to help create a long-term 
      eco-friendly sugarcane cropping system.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Plant-associated microbial communities play important roles in host 
      nutrition, development and defence. In particular, the microbes living within 
      internal plant tissues can affect plant metabolism in a more intimate way. 
      Understanding the factors that shape plant microbial composition and discovering 
      enriched microbes within endophytic compartments would thus be valuable to gain 
      knowledge on potential plant-microbial coevolutions. However, these interactions 
      are usually studied through reductionist approaches (in vitro models or crop 
      controlled systems). Here, we investigate these ecological factors in wild forest 
      niches using proximally located plants from two distant taxa (blueberry and 
      blackberry) as a model. RESULTS: Although the microbial communities were quite 
      similar in both plants, we found that sampling site had a high influence on them; 
      specifically, its impact on the rhizosphere communities was higher than that on 
      the roots. Plant species and sample type (root vs. rhizosphere) affected the 
      bacterial communities more than the fungal communities. For instance, 
      Xanthobacteraceae and Helotiales taxa were more enriched in roots, while the 
      abundance of Gemmatimonadetes was higher in rhizospheres. Acidobacteria abundance 
      within the endosphere of blueberry was similar to that in soil. Several taxa were 
      significantly associated with either blackberry or blueberry samples regardless 
      of the sampling site. For instance, we found a significant endospheric enrichment 
      of Nevskia in blueberry and of Sphingobium, Novosphingobium and Steroidobacter in 
      blackberry. CONCLUSIONS: There are selective enrichment and exclusion processes 
      in the roots of plants that shapes a differential composition between plant 
      species and sample types (root endosphere-rhizosphere). The special enrichment of 
      some microbial taxa in each plant species might suggest the presence of ancient 
      selection and/or speciation processes and might imply specific symbiosis. The 
      selection of fungi by the host is more pronounced when considering the fungal 
      trait rather than the taxonomy. This work helps to understand plant-microbial 
      interactions in natural ecosystems and the microbiome features of plants.

AB  - Plant-soil-microbe interactions are crucial for driving rhizosphere processes 
      that contribute to metabolite turnover and nutrient cycling. With the increasing 
      frequency and severity of water scarcity due to climate warming, understanding 
      how plant-mediated processes, such as root exudation, influence soil organic 
      matter turnover in the rhizosphere is essential. In this study, we used 16S rRNA 
      gene amplicon sequencing, rhizosphere metabolomics, and position-specific 
      (13)C-pyruvate labeling to examine the effects of three different plant species 
      (Piper auritum, Hibiscus rosa sinensis, and Clitoria fairchildiana) and their 
      associated microbial communities on soil organic carbon turnover in the 
      rhizosphere. Our findings indicate that in these tropical plants, the rhizosphere 
      metabolome is primarily shaped by the response of roots to drought rather than 
      direct shifts in the rhizosphere bacterial community composition. Specifically, 
      the reduced exudation of plant roots had a notable effect on the metabolome of 
      the rhizosphere of P. auritum, with less reliance on neighboring microbes. 
      Contrary to P. auritum, H. rosa sinensis and C. fairchildiana experienced changes 
      in their exudate composition during drought, causing alterations to the bacterial 
      communities in the rhizosphere. This, in turn, had a collective impact on the 
      rhizosphere's metabolome. Furthermore, the exclusion of phylogenetically distant 
      microbes from the rhizosphere led to shifts in its metabolome. Additionally, C. 
      fairchildiana appeared to be associated with only a subset of symbiotic bacteria 
      under drought conditions. These results indicate that plant species-specific 
      microbial interactions systematically change with the root metabolome. As roots 
      respond to drought, their associated microbial communities adapt, potentially 
      reinforcing the drought tolerance strategies of plant roots. These findings have 
      significant implications for maintaining plant health and preference during 
      drought stress and improving plant performance under climate change.

AB  - The process of forest range shift not only affects the vegetation aboveground but 
      also influences the dynamics of belowground microbial communities. To investigate 
      the changes in soil under forest range shift, we examined the natural forest soil 
      microbiome along with its corresponding physicochemical properties, as well as 
      the afforestation of natural forest by seedlings and sowing. By utilizing natural 
      forests and employing different afforestation methods, we simulated the three 
      stages of forest range shift: the staging stage, regeneration, and colonization. 
      We employed network analysis and phylogenetic assemblages to examine the 
      structure of soil microbial communities during these three stages in a 
      macro-environmental change context. Ordination and regression analyses were also 
      used to explore the correlation between microorganisms, environmental factors, 
      and changes in their niches. The findings revealed that different afforestation 
      (range shift) types led to distinct microbial compositions. Seedling 
      afforestation exhibited similarities to mature forests, suggesting a significant 
      influence on below-ground microorganisms. In contrast, sowing-based afforestation 
      resulted in small changes in soil microbes, indicating a legacy effect on 
      grassland soils. The impact of the rhizosphere on microbial composition remained 
      consistent across the three forest types. Overall, this study underscores the 
      significance of forest range shift in shaping soil microbial communities and 
      emphasizes the need to consider these dynamics in forest management and 
      restoration endeavours.

AB  - To better conserve the ecology of the wild Rhododendron mucronulatum range, we 
      studied the rhizosphere microenvironment of R. mucronulatum in Beijing's Yunmeng 
      Mountain National Forest Park. R. mucronulatum rhizosphere soil physicochemical 
      properties and enzyme activities changed significantly with temporal and 
      elevational gradients. The correlations between soil water content (SWC), 
      electrical conductivity (EC), organic matter content (OM), total nitrogen content 
      (TN), catalase activity (CAT), sucrose-converting enzyme activity (INV), and 
      urease activity (URE) were significant and positive in the flowering and 
      deciduous periods. The alpha diversity of the rhizosphere bacterial community was 
      significantly higher in the flowering period than in the deciduous period, and 
      the effect of elevation was insignificant. The diversity of the R. mucronulatum 
      rhizosphere bacterial community changed significantly with the change in the 
      growing period. A network analysis of the correlations revealed stronger linkages 
      between the rhizosphere bacterial communities in the deciduous period than in the 
      flowering period. Rhizomicrobium was the dominant genus in both periods, but its 
      relative abundance decreased in the deciduous period. Changes in the relative 
      abundance of Rhizomicrobium may be the main factor influencing the changes in the 
      R. mucronulatum rhizosphere bacterial community. Moreover, the R. mucronulatum 
      rhizosphere bacterial community and soil characteristics were significantly 
      correlated. Additionally, the influence of soil physicochemical properties on the 
      rhizosphere bacterial community was larger than that of enzyme activity on the 
      bacterial community. We mainly analyzed the change patterns in the rhizosphere 
      soil properties and rhizosphere bacterial diversity of R. mucronulatum during 
      temporal and spatial variation, laying the foundation for further understanding 
      of the ecology of wild R. mucronulatum.

TI  - Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi associated with the rhizosphere of an endemic 
      terrestrial bromeliad and a grass in the Brazilian neotropical dry forest.

AB  - Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi form symbiotic associations with 80-90% of all known 
      plants, allowing the fungi to acquire plant-synthesized carbon, and confer an 
      increased capacity for nutrient uptake by plants, improving tolerance to abiotic 
      and biotic stresses. We aimed at characterizing the mycorrhizal community in the 
      rhizosphere of Neoglaziovia variegata (so-called ;caroa;) and Tripogonella 
      spicata (so-called resurrection plant), using high-throughput sequencing of the 
      partial 18S rRNA gene. Both plants are currently undergoing a bioprospecting 
      program to find microbes with the potential of helping plants tolerate water 
      stress. Sampling was carried out in the Caatinga biome, a neotropical dry forest, 
      located in northeastern Brazil. Illumina MiSeq sequencing of 37 rhizosphere 
      samples (19 for N. variegata and 18 for T. spicata) revealed a distinct 
      mycorrhizal community between the studied plants. According to alpha diversity 
      analyses, T. spicata showed the highest richness and diversity based on the 
      Observed ASVs and the Shannon index, respectively. On the other hand, N. 
      variegata showed higher modularity of the mycorrhizal network compared to T. 
      spicata. The four most abundant genera found (higher than 10%) were Glomus, 
      Gigaspora, Acaulospora, and Scutellospora, with Glomus being the most abundant in 
      both plants. Nonetheless, Gigaspora, Diversispora, and Ambispora were found only 
      in the rhizosphere of N. variegata, whilst Scutellospora, Paraglomus, and 
      Archaeospora were exclusive to the rhizosphere of T. spicata. Therefore, the 
      community of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi of the rhizosphere of each plant 
      encompasses a unique composition, structure and modularity, which can 
      differentially assist them in the hostile environment.

AB  - Cathaya argyrophylla is an ancient Pinaceae species endemic to China that is 
      listed on the IUCN Red List. Although C. argyrophylla is an ectomycorrhizal 
      plant, the relationship between its rhizospheric soil microbial community and 
      soil properties related to the natural habitat remains unknown. High-throughput 
      sequencing of bacterial 16S rRNA genes and fungal ITS region sequences was used 
      to survey the C. argyrophylla soil community at four natural spatially 
      distributed points in Hunan Province, China, and functional profiles were 
      predicted using PICRUSt2 and FUNGuild. The dominant bacterial phyla included 
      Proteobacteria, Acidobacteria, Actinobacteria, and Chloroflexi, and the dominant 
      genus was Acidothermus. The dominant fungal phyla were Basidiomycota and 
      Ascomycota, while Russula was the dominant genus. Soil properties were the main 
      factors leading to changes in rhizosphere soil bacterial and fungal communities, 
      with nitrogen being the main driver of changes in soil microbial communities. The 
      metabolic capacities of the microbial communities were predicted to identify 
      differences in their functional profiles, including amino acid transport and 
      metabolism, energy production and conversion, and the presence of fungi, 
      including saprotrophs and symbiotrophs. These findings illuminate the soil 
      microbial ecology of C. argyrophylla, and provide a scientific basis for 
      screening rhizosphere microorganisms that are suitable for vegetation restoration 
      and reconstruction for this important threatened species.

AB  - Cnidium officinale Makino, a perennial crop in the Umbeliperae family, is one of 
      Korea's representative forest medicinal plants. However, the growing area of C. 
      officinale has been reduced by plant disease and soil sickness caused by fusarium 
      wilt. This study isolated rhizosphere bacteria from C. officinale, and their 
      antagonistic activity was evaluated against Fusarium solani. Particularly, four 
      isolated strains, namely, PT1, ST7, ST8, and SP4, showed a significant 
      antagonistic activity against F. solani. An in planta test showed that the 
      mortality rates of shoots were significantly low in the PT1-inoculated group. The 
      fresh and dry weights of the inoculated plants were also higher than that of the 
      other groups. The 16S rRNA gene sequencing identified the strain PT1 as Leclercia 
      adecarboxylata, and downstream studies confirmed the production of 
      antagonism-related enzymes such as siderophore and N-acetyl-beta-glucosaminidase. 
      The phosphorous solubilizing ability and secretion of related enzymes were also 
      analyzed. The results showed that PT1 strain could be utilized as promising plant 
      growth-promoting rhizobacteria (PGPR) and biocontrol agents (BCAs).

AB  - Fertilization can be optimized and managed during the flue-cured tobacco growing 
      period by studying the response of soil and microbial biomass stoichiometric 
      characteristics to fertilization. In this study, we investigated the effect of 
      compound fertilizers combined with microbial fertilizer treatments on the 
      stoichiometric characteristics of the rhizosphere soil and the limitations of 
      microbial resources during the flue-cured tobacco growing period. The results 
      indicated that soil and microbial C:N:P varied greatly with the growing period. 
      The effect of sampling time was usually greater than that of fertilization 
      treatment, and microbial C:N:P did not vary with the soil resource stoichiometric 
      ratio. The microbial metabolism of the tobacco-growing soil was limited by 
      phosphorus after extending the growing period, and phosphorus limitation 
      gradually increased from the root extension to the maturation periods but 
      decreased at harvest. The rhizosphere soil microbial nitrogen and phosphorus 
      limitations were mainly affected by soil water content, soil pH, microbial 
      biomass carbon, and the ratio of microbial biomass carbon to microbial biomass 
      phosphorus. Applying microbial fertilizer reduced phosphorus limitation. 
      Therefore, applying microbial fertilizer regulated the limitation of microbial 
      resources by affecting the soil and microbial biomass C:N:P in flue-cured tobacco 
      rhizosphere soils.

AB  - To study the characteristics of bacterial community structure in high-yield and 
      low-yield moso bamboo (Phyllostachys edulis) forests, we collected bamboo 
      rhizome, rhizome root, stem, leaf, rhizosphere soil, and non-rhizosphere soil 
      from high- and low-yield forests in Yong'an City and Jiangle County of Fujian 
      Province, China. The genomic DNA of the samples was extracted, sequenced and 
      analyzed. The results show that: the common differences between the high-yield 
      and low-yield P. edulis forest samples in the two regions were mainly in 
      bacterial community compositions in the bamboo rhizome, rhizome root, and soil 
      samples. Differences in the bacterial community compositions in the stem and leaf 
      samples were insignificant. The bacterial species and diversity in rhizome root 
      and rhizosphere soil of high-yield P. edulis forests were less than those of 
      low-yield forests. The relative abundance of Actinobacteria and Acidobacteria in 
      rhizome root samples of high-yield forests was higher than that in low-yield 
      forests. The relative abundance of Rhizobiales and Burkholderiales in bamboo 
      rhizome samples in high-yield forests was higher than that in low-yield forests. 
      The relative abundance of Bradyrhizobium in bamboo rhizome samples in high-yield 
      forests was higher than that in low-yield forests in the two regions. The change 
      of bacterial community composition in P. edulis stems and leaves showed little 
      correlation with high- or low-yields of P. edulis forests. Notably, the bacterial 
      community composition of the rhizome root system was correlated with the high 
      yield of bamboo. This study provides a theoretical basis for using of microbes to 
      enhance the yields of P. edulis forests.

AB  - Huanglongbing (HLB), the most prevalent citrus disease worldwide, is responsible 
      for substantial yield and economic losses. Phytobiomes, which have critical 
      effects on plant health, are associated with HLB outcomes. The development of a 
      refined model for predicting HLB outbreaks based on phytobiome markers may 
      facilitate early disease detection, thus enabling growers to minimize damages. 
      Although some investigations have focused on differences in the phytobiomes of 
      HLB-infected citrus plants and healthy ones, individual studies are inappropriate 
      for generating common biomarkers useful for detecting HLB on a global scale. In 
      this study, we therefore obtained bacterial information from several independent 
      datasets representing hundreds of citrus samples from six continents and used 
      these data to construct HLB prediction models based on 10 machine learning 
      algorithms. We detected clear differences in the phyllosphere and rhizosphere 
      microbiomes of HLB-infected and healthy citrus samples. Moreover, phytobiome 
      alpha diversity indices were consistently higher for healthy samples. 
      Furthermore, the contribution of stochastic processes to citrus rhizosphere and 
      phyllosphere microbiome assemblies decreased in response to HLB. Comparison of 
      all constructed models indicated that a random forest model based on 28 bacterial 
      genera in the rhizosphere and a bagging model based on 17 bacterial species in 
      the phyllosphere predicted the health status of citrus plants with almost 100% 
      accuracy. Our results thus demonstrate that machine learning models and 
      phytobiome biomarkers may be applied to evaluate the health status of citrus 
      plants.

AB  - Moso-bamboo (Phyllostachys edulis), with the favor of human disturbance, rapidly 
      invades adjacent forests to form monocultures in East Asia. Moso-bamboo not only 
      intrudes the broadleaf forests but also the coniferous, and it could impact by 
      above- and below-ground pathways. However, it still remains unclear whether the 
      below-ground performance of moso-bamboo differs from broadleaf to coniferous 
      forests, especially those differing in competitive and nutrient acquisition 
      strategies. In this study, we investigated three types of forest stands in 
      Guangdong, China, including a bamboo monoculture, a coniferous forest, and a 
      broadleaf forest. We found that moso-bamboo may suffer stronger soil P limitation 
      (soil N/P = 18.16) and may be infected by more AMF in coniferous than broadleaf 
      forests (soil N/P = 16.17). Based on our PLS-path model analysis, soil P resource 
      may be the key to differ moso-bamboo root morphology and rhizosphere microbe in 
      different forests: in broadleaf forests with weaker soil P limitation, may be 
      realized through increasing specific root length and specific surface area, 
      whereas in coniferous forests with stronger soil, P limitation may be realized 
      through combining more AMF. Our study highlights the importance of underground 
      mechanisms about moso-bamboo expansion in different forest communities.

AB  - Soil fungi are a key component of terrestrial ecosystems and play a major role in 
      soil biogeochemical cycling. Although the diversity and composition of fungal 
      communities are regulated by many abiotic and biotic factors, the effect of 
      elevation on soil fungal community diversity and composition remains largely 
      unknown. In this study, the soil fungal composition and diversity in Deyeuxia 
      angustifolia populations along an elevational gradient (1,690 m to 2020 m a.s.l.) 
      were assessed, using Illumina MiSeq sequencing, on the north-facing slope of the 
      Changbai Mountain, northeastern China. Our results showed that soil 
      physicochemical parameters changed significantly along with the elevational 
      gradients. The Ascomycota and Basidiomycota were the most dominant phyla along 
      with the gradient. Alpha diversity of soil fungi decreased significantly with 
      elevation. Soil nitrate nitrogen (NO(3)(-)-N) was positively correlated with 
      fungal richness and phylogenetic diversity (PD), indicating that soil nitrate 
      nitrogen (NO(3)(-)-N) is a key soil property determining fungal community 
      diversity. In addition to soil nitrate content, soil pH and soil moisture were 
      the most important environmental properties determining the soil fungal 
      diversity. Our results suggest that the elevational changes in soil 
      physicochemical properties play a key role in shaping the community composition 
      and diversity of soil fungi. This study will allow us to better understand the 
      biodiversity distribution patterns of soil microorganisms in mountain ecosystems.

TI  - Effects of arbuscular mycorrhizae and extraradical mycelium of subtropical tree 
      species on soil nitrogen mineralization and enzyme activities.
PG  - 1235-1243
LID - 10.13287/j.1001-9332.202305.016 [doi]
AB  - Through symbiosis with plants, arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi effectively 
      improve the availability of soil nitrogen (N). However, the mechanism through 
      which AM and associated extraradical mycelium affect soil N mineralization 
      remains unknow. We carried out an in situ soil culture experiment by using 
      in-growth cores in plantations of three subtropical tree species, Cunninghamia 
      lanceolata, Schima superba, and Liquidambar formosana. We measured soil physical 
      and chemical properties, net N mineralization rate, and the activities of four 
      kinds of hydrolase (leucine aminopeptidase (LAP), beta-1,4-N-acetylglucosaminidase 
      (NAG), beta-1,4-glucosidase (betaG), cellobiohydrolase (CB)) and two kinds of oxidases 
      (polyphenol oxidase (POX) and peroxidase (PER)) involved in soil organic matter 
      (SOM) mineralization in treatments of mycorrhiza (with absorbing roots and 
      hyphae), hyphae (hyphae only), and control (mycorrhiza-free). The results showed 
      that mycorrhizal treatments significantly affected soil total carbon and pH but 
      did not affect N mineralization rates and all enzymatic activities. Tree species 
      significantly affected net ammonification rate, net N mineralization rate and 
      activities of NAG, betaG, CB, POX and PER. The net N mineralization rate and enzyme 
      activities in the C. lanceolata stand were significantly higher than that in 
      monoculture broad-leaved stands of either S. superba or L. formosana. There was 
      no interactive effect of mycorrhizal treatment and tree species on any of soil 
      properties, nor on enzymatic activities or net N mineralization rates. Soil pH 
      was negatively and significantly correlated with five kinds of enzymatic 
      activities except for LAP, while net N mineralization rate significantly 
      correlated with ammonium nitrogen content, available phosphorus content, and the 
      activity level of betaG, CB, POX, and PER. In conclusion, there was no difference in 
      enzymatic activities and N mineralization rates between rhizosphere and 
      hyphosphere soils of three subtropical tree species in the whole growing season. 
      The activity of particular carbon cycle-related enzymes was closely related to 
      soil N mineralization rate. It is suggested that differences in litter quality 
      and root functional traits among different tree species affect soil enzyme 
      activities and N mineralization rates through organic matter inputs and shaping 
      soil condition.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Salt stress inhibits the beneficial effects of most plant 
      growth-promoting rhizobacteria. The synergistic relationship between beneficial 
      rhizosphere microorganisms and plants helps achieve more stable growth-promoting 
      effects. This study aimed 1) to elucidate changes in gene expression profiles in 
      the roots and leaves of wheat after inoculation with compound microbial agents 
      and 2) to determine the mechanisms by which plant growth-promoting rhizobacteria 
      mediate plant responses to microorganisms. METHODS: Following inoculation with 
      compound bacteria, transcriptome characteristics of gene expression profiles of 
      wheat, roots, and leaves at the flowering stage were investigated using Illumina 
      high-throughput sequencing technology. Gene ontology (GO) function and Kyoto 
      Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) enrichment analyses were performed on 
      the genes that were significantly differentially expressed. RESULTS: The 
      expression of 231 genes in the roots of bacterial preparations (BIO) -inoculated 
      wheat changed significantly (including 35 upregulated and 196 downregulated 
      genes) compared with that of non-inoculated wheat. The expression of 16,321 genes 
      in leaves changed significantly, including 9651 upregulated genes and 6670 
      downregulated genes. The differentially expressed genes were involved in the 
      metabolism of carbohydrates, amino acids, and secondary compounds as well as 
      signal transduction pathways. The ethylene receptor 1 gene in wheat leaves was 
      significantly downregulated, and genes related to ethylene-responsive 
      transcription factor were significantly upregulated. GO enrichment analysis 
      showed that metabolic and cellular processes were the main functions affected in 
      the roots and leaves. The main molecular functions altered were binding and 
      catalytic activities, among which the cellular oxidant detoxification enrichment 
      rate was highly expressed in the roots. The expression of peroxisome size 
      regulation was the highest in the leaves. KEGG enrichment analysis showed that 
      linoleic acid metabolism expression was highest in the roots, and the expression 
      of photosynthesis-antenna proteins was the highest in leaves. After inoculation 
      with a complex biosynthesis agent, the phenylalanine ammonia lyase (PAL) gene of 
      the phenylpropanoid biosynthesis pathway was upregulated in wheat leaf cells 
      while 4CL, CCR, and CYP73A were downregulated. Additionally, CYP98A and REF1 
      genes involved in the flavonoid biosynthesis pathway were upregulated, while F5H, 
      HCT, CCR, E2.1.1.104, and TOGT1-related genes were downregulated. DISCUSSION: 
      Differentially expressed genes may play key roles in improving salt tolerance in 
      wheat. Compound microbial inoculants promoted the growth of wheat under salt 
      stress and improved disease resistance by regulating the expression of 
      metabolism-related genes in wheat roots and leaves and activating immune 
      pathway-related genes.

TI  - Distribution and Environmental Drivers of Fungal Denitrifiers in Global Soils.
PG  - e0006123
LID - 10.1128/spectrum.00061-23 [doi]
LID - e00061-23
AB  - The microbial process of denitrification is the primary source of the greenhouse 
      gas nitrous oxide (N(2)O) from terrestrial ecosystems. Fungal denitrifiers, 
      unlike many bacteria, lack the N(2)O reductase, and thereby are sources of N(2)O. 
      Still, their diversity, global distribution, and environmental determinants, as 
      well as their relative importance, compared to bacterial and archaeal 
      denitrifiers, remain unresolved. Employing a phylogenetically informed approach 
      to analyze 1,980 global soil and rhizosphere metagenomes for the denitrification 
      marker gene nirK, which codes for the copper dependent nitrite reductase in 
      denitrification, we show that fungal denitrifiers are sparse, yet cosmopolitan 
      and that they are dominated by saprotrophs and pathogens. Few showed 
      biome-specific distribution patterns, although members of the Fusarium oxysporum 
      species complex, which are known to produce substantial amounts of N(2)O, were 
      proportionally more abundant and diverse in the rhizosphere than in other biomes. 
      Fungal denitrifiers were most frequently detected in croplands, but they were 
      most abundant in forest soils when normalized to metagenome size. Nevertheless, 
      the overwhelming dominance of bacterial and archaeal denitrifiers suggests a much 
      lower fungal contribution to N(2)O emissions than was previously estimated. In 
      relative terms, they could play a role in soils that are characterized by a high 
      carbon to nitrogen ratio and a low pH, especially in the tundra as well as in 
      boreal and temperate coniferous forests. Because global warming predicts the 
      proliferation of fungal pathogens, the prevalence of potential plant pathogens 
      among fungal denitrifiers and the cosmopolitan distribution of these organisms 
      suggest that fungal denitrifier abundance may increase in terrestrial ecosystems. 
      IMPORTANCE Fungal denitrifiers, in contrast to their bacterial counterparts, are 
      a poorly studied functional group within the nitrogen cycle, even though they 
      produce the greenhouse gas N(2)O. To curb soil N(2)O emissions, a better 
      understanding of their ecology and distribution in soils from different 
      ecosystems is needed. Here, we probed a massive amount of DNA sequences and 
      corresponding soil data from a large number of samples that represented the major 
      soil environments for a broad understanding of fungal denitrifier diversity at 
      the global scale. We show that fungal denitrifiers are predominantly cosmopolitan 
      saprotrophs and opportunistic pathogens. Fungal denitrifiers constituted, on 
      average, 1% of the total denitrifier community. This suggests that earlier 
      estimations of fungal denitrifier abundance, and, thereby, it is also likely that 
      the contributions of fungal denitrifiers to N(2)O emissions have been 
      overestimated. Nevertheless, with many fungal denitrifiers being plant pathogens, 
      they could become increasingly relevant, as soilborne pathogenic fungi are 
      predicted to increase with ongoing climate change.

TI  - Bacterial inoculation of Quercus pyrenaica trees alters co-occurrence patterns 
      but not the composition of the rhizosphere bacteriome in wild conditions.
PG  - 1747-1761
LID - 10.1111/1462-2920.16388 [doi]
AB  - Quercus pyrenaica is a woody species of high landscape value, however, its 
      forests show an advanced state of degradation in the Iberian Peninsula. 
      Afforestation typically has low success, thus, it is necessary to improve the 
      fitness of oaks plantlets to be transplanted, for instance, by inoculating 
      beneficial microorganisms. In adding microorganisms to ecosystems, there must be 
      balanced efficacy with potential effects on native microbial communities. We 
      addressed changes in diversity, richness, composition and co-occurrence networks 
      of prokaryotic communities in the rhizosphere of inoculated and control trees 
      outplanted to three different sites located in the Sierra Nevada National and 
      Natural Park (Spain). After 18 months in wild conditions, we did not detect 
      changes due to the inoculation in the richness, diversity and structure in none 
      of the sites. However, we observed an increase in the complexity of the 
      co-occurrence networks in two experimental areas. Modularization of the networks 
      changed as a result of the inoculation, although the sense of the change depended 
      on the site. Although it was impossible to unravel the effect of bacterial 
      inoculation, our results highlighted that inoculation alters the association of 
      rhizosphere bacteria without entailing other changes, so networks should be 
      analysed prior to inoculating the plantlets.

AB  - Black truffles and white truffles are widely studied around the world, but their 
      effects on plant growth and physiological responses, and on the mycorrhizosphere 
      bacterial community of the host plant remain unclear. Here, mycorrhizal 
      colonization of Castanopsis rockii by Tuber indicum (Chinese black truffle) and 
      T. lijiangense (Chinese white truffle), respectively, was induced in a greenhouse 
      study, and their effects on host growth, physiological responses and 
      mycorrhizosphere bacterial communities were compared. The results show that 
      colonization of both Tuber species significantly increased leaf photosynthetic 
      rate, leaf P concentration and mycorrhizosphere acid phosphatase activity, as 
      well as richness of mycorrhizosphere bacterial communities of C. rockii 
      seedlings. However, T. indicum colonization on the one hand significantly 
      decreased tartrate content, bacterial acid phosphatase, phoC gene abundance in 
      the mycorrhizosphere, and peroxidase (POD) activity of ectomycorrhizal root tips, 
      but on the other hand increased mycorrhizosphere pH and superoxide dismutase 
      (SOD) of ectomycorrhizal root tips, compared to T. lijiangense colonization. 
      Moreover, principal coordinate and beta-diversity analyses show significant 
      differences in mycorrhizosphere bacterial community composition between T. 
      indicum and T. lijiangese colonized C. rockii seedlings. Finally, the relative 
      abundance of the bacterium Agromyces cerinus significantly correlated to 
      mycorrhizosphere acid phosphatase activity and leaf P concentration, suggesting 
      that this bacterium might play an important role in P mobilization and 
      acquisition. Overall, these results suggest that T. indicum and T. lijiangense 
      differently regulate their host plant's physiological responses and 
      mycorrhizosphere bacterial community.

AB  - Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) in the roots and soil surrounding their hosts 
      are typically independently investigated and little is known of the relationships 
      between the communities of the two compartments. We simultaneously collected root 
      and surrounding soil samples from Cryptomeria japonica (Cj) and Chamaecyparis 
      obtusa (Co) at three environmentally different sites. Based on molecular and 
      morphological analyses, we characterized their associated AMF communities. Cj was 
      more densely colonized than Co and that root colonization intensity was 
      significantly correlated with soil AMF diversity. The communities comprised 15 
      AMF genera dominated by Glomus and Paraglomus and 1443 operational taxonomic 
      units (OTUs) of which 1067 and 1170 were in roots and soil, respectively. AMF 
      communities were significantly different among sites, and the root AMF 
      communities were significantly different from those of soil at each site. The 
      root and soil AMF communities responded differently to soil pH. At the genus 
      level, Glomus and Acaulospora were abundant in roots while Paraglomus and 
      Redeckera were abundant in soil. Our findings suggest that AMF colonizing roots 
      are protected from environmental stresses in soil. However, the 
      root-soil-abundant taxa have adapted to both environments and represent a model 
      AMF symbiont. This evidence of strategic exploitation of the rhizosphere by AMF 
      supports prior hypotheses and provides insights into community ecology.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Plant invasion can profoundly alter ecosystem processes driven by 
      microorganisms. The fundamental mechanisms linking microbial communities, 
      functional genes, and edaphic characteristics in invaded ecosystems are, 
      nevertheless, poorly understood. METHODS: Here, soil microbial communities and 
      functions were determined across 22 Amaranthus palmeri (A. palmeri) invaded 
      patches by pairwise 22 native patches located in the Jing-Jin-Ji region of China 
      using high-throughput amplicon sequencing and quantitative microbial element 
      cycling technologies. RESULTS: As a result, the composition and structure of 
      rhizosphere soil bacterial communities differed significantly between invasive 
      and native plants according to principal coordinate analysis. A. palmeri soils 
      exhibited higher abundance of Bacteroidetes and Nitrospirae, and lower abundance 
      of Actinobacteria than native soils. Additionally, compared to native rhizosphere 
      soils, A. palmeri harbored a much more complex functional gene network with 
      higher edge numbers, average degree, and average clustering coefficient, as well 
      as lower network distance and diameter. Furthermore, the five keystone taxa 
      identified in A. palmeri rhizosphere soils belonged to the orders of 
      Longimicrobiales, Kineosporiales, Armatimonadales, Rhizobiales and Myxococcales, 
      whereas Sphingomonadales and Gemmatimonadales predominated in the native 
      rhizosphere soils. Moreover, random forest model revealed that keystone taxa were 
      more important indicators of soil functional attributes than edaphic variables in 
      both A. palmeri and native rhizosphere soils. For edaphic variables, only 
      ammonium nitrogen was a significant predictor of soil functional potentials in A. 
      palmeri invaded ecosystems. We also found keystone taxa in A. palmeri rhizosphere 
      soils had strong and positive correlations with functional genes compared to 
      native soils. DISCUSSION: Our study highlighted the importance of keystone taxa 
      as a driver of soil functioning in invaded ecosystem.

TI  - Volatile Organic Compounds of Bacillus velezensis GJ-7 against Meloidogyne hapla 
      through Multiple Prevention and Control Modes.
LID - 10.3390/molecules28073182 [doi]
LID - 3182
AB  - The Bacillus velezensis GJ-7 strain isolated from the rhizosphere soil of Panax 
      notoginseng showed high nematicidal activity and therefore has been considered a 
      biological control agent that could act against the root-knot nematode 
      Meloidogyne hapla. However, little was known about whether the GJ-7 strain could 
      produce volatile organic compounds (VOCs) that were effective in biocontrol 
      against M. hapla. In this study, we evaluated the nematicidal activity of VOCs 
      produced by the fermentation of GJ-7 in three-compartment Petri dishes. The 
      results revealed that the mortality rates of M. hapla J2s were 85% at 24 h and 
      97.1% at 48 h after treatment with the VOCs produced during GJ-7 fermentation. 
      Subsequently, the VOCs produced by the GJ-7 strain were identified through 
      solid-phase micro-extraction gas chromatography mass spectrometry (SPME-GC/MS). 
      Six characteristic VOCs from the GJ-7 strain fermentation broth were identified, 
      including 3-methyl-1-butanol, 3-methyl-2-pentanone, 5-methyl-2-hexanone, 
      2-heptanone, 2,5-dimethylpyrazine, and 6-methyl-2-heptanone. The in vitro 
      experimental results from 24-well culture plates showed that the six volatiles 
      had direct-contact nematicidal activity against M. hapla J2s and inhibition 
      activity against egg hatching. In addition, 3-methyl-1-butanol and 2-heptanone 
      showed significant fumigation effects on M. hapla J2s and eggs. Furthermore, all 
      six of the VOCs repelled M. hapla J2 juveniles in 2% water agar Petri plates. The 
      above data suggested that the VOCs of B. velezensis GJ-7 acted against M. hapla 
      through multiple prevention and control modes (including direct-contact 
      nematicidal activity, fumigant activity, and repellent activity), and therefore 
      could be considered as potential biocontrol agents against root-knot nematodes.

AB  - In an era of global environmental change, conservation of threatened biodiversity 
      and ecosystem restoration are formidable ecological challenges. The forest 
      understory strata and the belowground soil environment including rhizospheric 
      microbial communities, which are crucial for ecosystem functioning and overall 
      forest biodiversity maintenance, have remained understudied. Here, we investigate 
      the soil microbiome of Trillium govanianum - an endangered Himalayan Forest herb, 
      to unravel the underground diversity, drivers, and potential indicators of the 
      microbial community. We collected rhizospheric and bulk soil samples for 
      microbiome and physicochemical analysis at three sites along an elevation 
      gradient (2500-3300 m) in Kashmir Himalaya. Amplicon sequencing of 16 S rRNA and 
      ITS was used to identify the bacterial and fungal soil microorganisms. We found 
      significant differences in the structure and diversity of microbial community 
      (bacterial and fungal) between the rhizosphere and bulk soil along the 
      altitudinal gradient, and noticeable shifts in the nutrient level in dominant 
      microbial phyla associated with T. govanianum. A significant difference between 
      soil physicochemical parameters and increasing altitude suggests that microbial 
      community structure is determined by altitude and soil type. Similarly, the 
      microbial communities showed a significant (P < 0.05) correlation with soil 
      physicochemical variables along the altitudinal gradient. The moisture content in 
      bacterial and total organic carbon in fungal communities showed the most 
      substantial impact on the physiochemical drivers. We also identify potential 
      bacterial and fungal plant growth promoter indicator species in the soil 
      microbiome of T. govanianum. Overall, our findings provide novel research 
      insights that can be pivotal in designing integrated species recovery programs 
      and long-term restoration plans for T. govanianum, with learnings for 
      biodiversity conservation elsewhere.

AB  - The intercropping of grass in orchards has beneficial effects on soil properties 
      and soil microbial communities and is an important soil management measure for 
      improving orchard productivity and land-use efficiency. However, few studies have 
      explored the effects of grass intercropping on rhizosphere microorganisms in 
      walnut orchards. In this study, we explored the microbial communities of clear 
      tillage (CT), walnut/ryegrass (Lolium perenne L.) (Lp), and walnut/hairy vetch 
      (Vicia villosa Roth.) (Vv) intercropping system using MiSeq sequencing and 
      metagenomic sequencing. The results revealed that the composition and structure 
      of the soil bacterial community changed significantly with walnut/Vv 
      intercropping compared to CT and walnut/Lp intercropping. Moreover, the 
      walnut/hairy vetch intercropping system had the most complex connections between 
      bacterial taxa. In addition, we found that the soil microorganisms of walnut/Vv 
      intercropping had a higher potential for nitrogen cycling and carbohydrate 
      metabolism, which may be related to the functions of Burkholderia, 
      Rhodopseudomonas, Pseudomonas, Agrobacterium, Paraburkholderia, and 
      Flavobacterium. Overall, this study provided a theoretical basis for 
      understanding the microbial communities associated with grass intercropping in 
      walnut orchards, providing better guidance for the management of walnut orchards.

AB  - Soil microorganisms play an important role in maintaining natural ecological 
      balance through active participation in carbon, nitrogen, sulfur, and phosphorous 
      cycles. Phosphate-solubilizing bacteria (PSB) are of high importance in the 
      rhizosphere, enhancing the solubilization of inorganic phosphorus complexes into 
      soluble forms available for plant nutrition. The investigation of this species of 
      bacteria is of major interest in agriculture, as they can be used as 
      biofertilizers for crops. In the present study, 28 isolates of PSB were obtained 
      after the phosphate enrichment of soil samples from five Tunisian regions. Five 
      PSB species were identified by 16S rRNA gene sequencing including Pseudomonas 
      fluorescens, P. putida, and P. taiwanensis, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, and 
      Pantoea agglomerans. Solid and liquid Pikovskaya's (PVK) and National Botanical 
      Research Institute's (NBRIP) media containing insoluble tricalcium phosphate were 
      used for the evaluation of the phosphate solubilization ability of the bacterial 
      isolates by two methods: visual evaluation of the solubilization zone around 
      colonies (halo) and determination of solubilized phosphates in liquid medium by 
      the colorimetric method of the vanado-molybdate yellow. Based on the results of 
      the halo method, the isolate of each species that showed the higher phosphate 
      solubilization index was selected for evaluation of phosphate solubilization by 
      the colorimetric method. In the liquid media, the bacterial isolates showed 
      phosphate solubilization ranging from 535.70 to 618.57 microg mL(-1) in the NBRIP 
      medium, and 374.20 to 544.28 microg mL(-1) in the PVK medium, with the highest values 
      produced by P. fluorescens. The best phosphate solubilization ability and higher 
      reduction in broth pH, which indicates higher organic acid production, were 
      achieved in NBRIP broth for most of the PSB. Strong correlations were observed 
      between the average capability of PSB to solubilize phosphates and both the pH 
      and total phosphorous content in the soil. The production of the hormone indole 
      acetic acid (IAA), which can promote plant growth, was observed for all five PSB 
      species. Among them, P. fluorescens obtained from the forest soil of northern 
      Tunisia showed the highest production of IAA (50.4 +/- 0.9 microg mL(-1)).

      L.) Genotypes.

AB  - Selenium (Se) is an essential micronutrient of fundamental importance to human 
      health and the main Se source is from plant-derived foods. Plants mainly take up 
      Se as selenate (SeO(4)(2-)), through the root sulfate transport system, because 
      of their chemical similarity. The aims of this study were (1) to characterize the 
      interaction between Se and S during the root uptake process, by measuring the 
      expression of genes coding for high-affinity sulfate transporters and (2) to 
      explore the possibility of increasing plant capability to take up Se by 
      modulating S availability in the growth medium. We selected different tetraploid 
      wheat genotypes as model plants, including a modern genotype, Svevo (Triticum 
      turgidum ssp. durum), and three ancient Khorasan wheats, Kamut, Turanicum 21, and 
      Etrusco (Triticum turgidum ssp. turanicum). The plants were cultivated 
      hydroponically for 20 days in the presence of two sulfate levels, adequate (S = 
      1.2 mM) and limiting (L = 0.06 mM), and three selenate levels (0, 10, 50 muM). Our 
      findings clearly showed the differential expression of genes encoding the two 
      high-affinity transporters (TdSultr1.1 and TdSultr1.3), which are involved in the 
      primary uptake of sulfate from the rhizosphere. Interestingly, Se accumulation in 
      shoots was higher when S was limited in the nutrient solution.

      with vegetation belts in the Andean Atacama Desert.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Soil microorganisms are in constant interaction with plants, and 
      these interactions shape the composition of soil bacterial communities by 
      modifying their environment. However, little is known about the relationship 
      between microorganisms and native plants present in extreme environments that are 
      not affected by human intervention. Using high-throughput sequencing in 
      combination with random forest and co-occurrence network analyses, we compared 
      soil bacterial communities inhabiting the rhizosphere surrounding soil (RSS) and 
      the corresponding bulk soil (BS) of 21 native plant species organized into three 
      vegetation belts along the altitudinal gradient (2400-4500 m a.s.l.) of the 
      Talabre-Lejia transect (TLT) in the slopes of the Andes in the Atacama Desert. We 
      assessed how each plant community influenced the taxa, potential functions, and 
      ecological interactions of the soil bacterial communities in this extreme natural 
      ecosystem. We tested the ability of the stress gradient hypothesis, which 
      predicts that positive species interactions become increasingly important as 
      stressful conditions increase, to explain the interactions among members of TLT 
      soil microbial communities. RESULTS: Our comparison of RSS and BS compartments 
      along the TLT provided evidence of plant-specific microbial community composition 
      in the RSS and showed that bacterial communities modify their ecological 
      interactions, in particular, their positive:negative connection ratios in the 
      presence of plant roots at each vegetation belt. We also identified the taxa 
      driving the transition of the BS to the RSS, which appear to be indicators of key 
      host-microbial relationships in the rhizosphere of plants in response to 
      different abiotic conditions. Finally, the potential functions of the bacterial 
      communities also diverge between the BS and the RSS compartments, particularly in 
      the extreme and harshest belts of the TLT. CONCLUSIONS: In this study, we 
      identified taxa of bacterial communities that establish species-specific 
      relationships with native plants and showed that over a gradient of changing 
      abiotic conditions, these relationships may also be plant community specific. 
      These findings also reveal that the interactions among members of the soil 
      microbial communities do not support the stress gradient hypothesis. However, 
      through the RSS compartment, each plant community appears to moderate the abiotic 
      stress gradient and increase the efficiency of the soil microbial community, 
      suggesting that positive interactions may be context dependent.

TI  - Revealing the role of the rhizosphere microbiota in reproductive growth for fruit 
      productivity when inorganic fertilizer is partially replaced by organic 
      fertilizer in pear orchard fields.
PG  - 1373-1392

AB  - In order to address the global crisis in pear productivity, there has been 
      increased attention given to advocating for the use of organic fertilizers. As 
      part of this effort, researchers have been investigating the microbial properties 
      of organic fertilizers to better understand their potential impact on fruit 
      productivity. Our research focused specifically on the impact of four different 
      ratios of sheep manure (SM) and chemical fertilizers (CF) on pear productivity. 
      We found that replacing CF with SM resulted in a proliferation of 
      gammaproteobacteria, Chlamydiae, Bastocatellia and Clostridia in the soil 
      rhizosphere, which is the region around the roots of plants where most nutrient 
      uptake occurs. Using redundancy analysis, we were able to determine that SM was 
      particularly effective at promoting the growth of gammaproteobacteria and 
      clostridia, which were associated with C:N ratios around 14:1 as well as the 
      availability of K, Fe, Zn and Cu. This combination of factors was conducive to a 
      transition from vegetative growth to reproductive growth, resulting in an 
      increase in pear production from 43 to 56 tons per hectare. We also discovered 
      that Blastociella acts as a buffering system in regulating soil acidity. Taken 
      together, our findings indicate that a combination of SM and CF can improve the 
      abundance of beneficial bacteria in the rhizosphere, leading to an increase in 
      pear productivity.

      plant rhizosphere communities.

AB  - Plasmids drive bacterial evolutionary innovation by transferring ecologically 
      important functions between lineages, but acquiring a plasmid often comes at a 
      fitness cost to the host cell. Compensatory mutations, which ameliorate the cost 
      of plasmid carriage, promote plasmid maintenance in simplified laboratory media 
      across diverse plasmid-host associations. Whether such compensatory evolution can 
      occur in more complex communities inhabiting natural environmental niches where 
      evolutionary paths may be more constrained is, however, unclear. Here, we show a 
      substantial fitness cost of carrying the large conjugative plasmid pQBR103 in 
      Pseudomonas fluorescens SBW25 in the plant rhizosphere. This plasmid fitness cost 
      could be ameliorated by compensatory mutations affecting the chromosomal global 
      regulatory system gacA/gacS, which arose rapidly in plant rhizosphere communities 
      and were exclusive to plasmid carriers. These findings expand our understanding 
      of the importance of compensatory evolution in plasmid dynamics beyond simplified 
      lab media. Compensatory mutations contribute to plasmid survival in bacterial 
      populations living within complex microbial communities in their environmental 
      niche.

TI  - Assembly processes underlying bacterial community differentiation among 
      geographically close mangrove forests.
PG  - 73-88
LID - 10.1002/mlf2.12060 [doi]
AB  - Bacterial communities play pivotal roles in nutrient cycling in mangrove forests. 
      The assembly of mangrove microbial communities has been found to be influenced by 
      complex factors, such as geographic distance, physicochemical conditions, and 
      plant identity, but the relative importance of these factors and how these 
      factors shape the assembling process remain elusive. We analyzed the bacterial 
      communities sampled from three mangrove species (Aegiceras corniculatum, 
      Bruguiera sexangula, and Kandelia obovata) at three locations along the estuarine 
      Dongzhai Harbor in Hainan, China. We revealed larger differences in rhizosphere 
      bacterial communities among geographical locations than among plant species, 
      indicated by differences in diversity, composition, and interaction networks. We 
      found that dispersal limitation and homogeneous selection have substantial 
      contributions to the assembly of mangrove rhizosphere bacterial communities in 
      all three locations. Following the phylogenetic-bin-based null model analysis 
      (iCAMP) framework, we also found dispersal limitation and homogeneous selection 
      showing dominance in some bins. The greater differences among geographic 
      locations may be mainly attributed to the larger proportions of dispersal 
      limitation even at such a short geographic distance. We also found that beta 
      diversity was positively correlated with environmental distances, implying that 
      the more similar environmental conditions (such as rich carbon and nitrogen 
      contents) among plant species may have shaped similar bacterial communities. We 
      concluded that the geographic distances, which are associated with dispersal 
      limitation, played a key role in assembling mangrove rhizosphere bacterial 
      communities, while physicochemical conditions and plant identity contributed 
      less.

      compounds is urgently required for the development of new drugs against diabetes. 
      Fungi are well known for their ability to produce new bioactive secondary 
      metabolites. In this study, four new prenylated indole-terpenoids (1-4), named 
      encindolenes I-L, as well as a known analogue (5), were isolated from the fungus 
      Penicillium sp. HFF16from the rhizosphere soil of Cynanchum bungei Decne. The 
      structures of the compounds were elucidated by spectroscopic data and ECD 
      analysis. In the antidiabetic activity assay, compounds 1-5 could inhibit 
      glucagon-induced hepatic glucose output with EC(50) values of 67.23, 102.1, 
      49.46, 25.20, and 35.96 muM, respectively, and decrease the intracellular cAMP

TI  - Plant growth strategy determines the magnitude and direction of drought-induced 
      changes in root exudates in subtropical forests.
PG  - 3476-3488
LID - 10.1111/gcb.16685 [doi]
AB  - Root exudates are an important pathway for plant-microbial interactions and are 
      highly sensitive to climate change. However, how extreme drought affects root 
      exudates and the main components, as well as species-specific differences in 
      response magnitude and direction, are poorly understood. In this study, root 
      exudation rates of total carbon (C) and its components (e.g., sugar, organic 
      acid, and amino acid) were measured under the control and extreme drought 
      treatments (i.e., 70% throughfall reduction) by in situ collection of four tree 
      species with different growth rates in a subtropical forest. We also quantified 
      soil properties, root morphological traits, and mycorrhizal infection rates to 
      examine the driving factors underlying variations in root exudation. Our results 
      showed that extreme drought significantly decreased root exudation rates of total 
      C, sugar, and amino acid by 17.8%, 30.8%, and 35.0%, respectively, but increased 
      root exudation rate of organic acid by 38.6%, which were largely associated with 
      drought-induced changes in tree growth rates, root morphological traits, and 
      mycorrhizal infection rates. Specifically, trees with relatively high growth 
      rates were more responsive to drought for root exudation rates compared with 
      those with relatively low growth rates, which were closely related to root 
      morphological traits and mycorrhizal infection rates. These findings highlight 
      the importance of plant growth strategy in mediating drought-induced changes in 
      root exudation rates. The coordinations among root exudation rates, root 
      morphological traits, and mycorrhizal symbioses in response to drought could be 
      incorporated into land surface models to improve the prediction of climate change 
      impacts on rhizosphere C dynamics in forest ecosystems.

AB  - Plant-soil-microbiota interactions mediated by root exudates regulate plant 
      growth and drive rhizosphere microbial feedbacks. It remains unknown how root 
      exudates affect rhizosphere microbiota and soil functions in the course of forest 
      plantation restoration. The metabolic profiles of tree root exudates are expected 
      to shift with stand age, leading to variation in rhizosphere microbiota 
      structure, and in turn, potentially altering soil functions. To unravel the 
      effects of root exudates, a multi-omics study was conducted using untargeted 
      metabonomic profiling, high-throughput microbiome sequencing and functional gene 
      array. The interactions among root exudates, rhizosphere microbiota and nutrient 
      cycling-related functional genes were explored under 15- to 45-year-old Robinia 
      pseudoacacia plantations in the Loess Plateau region of China. Root exudate 
      metabolic profiles, rather than chemodiversity, markedly changed with an increase 
      in stand age. A total of 138 age-related metabolites were extracted from a key 
      module of root exudates. The relative contents of six biomarker metabolites, such 
      as glucose-1-phosphate, gluconic acid and N-acetylneuraminic acid, increased 
      distinctly over time. The biomarker taxa (16 classes) of rhizosphere microbiota 
      varied in a time-sensitive manner, which played potential roles in nutrient 
      cycling and plant health. Nitrospira, Alphaproteobacteria and Acidobacteria were 
      enriched in the rhizosphere of older stands. Key root exudates influenced 
      functional gene abundances in the rhizosphere via direct effects or indirectly 
      through biomarker microbial taxa (e.g., Nitrososphaeria). Overall, root exudates 
      and rhizosphere microbiota are essential for soil function maintenance in R. 
      pseudoacacia plantation restoration.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Identifying spatial patterns of biodiversity along elevational 
      gradients provides a unified framework for understanding these patterns and 
      predicting ecological responses to climate change. Moreover, microorganisms and 
      plants are closely interconnected (e.g., via the rhizosphere) and thus may share 
      spatial patterns of diversity and show similar relationships with environments. 
      METHODS: This study compared diversity patterns and relationships with 
      environments in host plants and rhizosphere microorganisms (including various 
      functional groups) along elevational gradients across three climatic zones. 
      RESULTS: We found that above-and belowground diversity decreased monotonically or 
      showed a hump-shaped or U-shaped pattern along elevation gradients. However, the 
      diversity patterns of plants, bacteria, and fungi varied depending on the taxon 
      and climatic zone. Temperature and humidity strongly contribute to above-and 
      belowground diversity patterns and community composition along elevational 
      gradients. Nonetheless, soil factors might be important regulators of diversity 
      patterns and the community composition of plants and microorganisms along these 
      gradients. Structural equation modeling revealed that environmental factors had a 
      stronger direct effect on rhizosphere microbial diversity than host plant 
      diversity. DISCUSSION: In sum, spatial patterns of diversity and their 
      relationships with environments in rhizosphere microorganisms and their host 
      plants differed at the regional scale. Different functional groups (e.g., 
      pathogen, mycorrhiza and nitrifier) of soil microorganisms may have divergent 
      elevational patterns and environmental responses. These data improve our 
      understanding of elevational diversity patterns, and provide new insights into 
      the conservation of biodiversity and ecosystem management, especially under 
      climate change.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Root-associated microorganisms promote plant growth and provide 
      protection from stresses. Halophytes are the fundamental components maintaining 
      ecosystem functions of coastal salt marshes; however, it is not clear how their 
      microbiome are structured across large spatial scales. Here, we investigated the 
      rhizosphere bacterial communities of typical coastal halophyte species 
      (Phragmites australis and Suaeda salsa) in temperate and subtropical salt marshes 
      across 1,100 km in eastern China. METHODS: The sampling sites were located from 
      30.33 to 40.90 degrees N and 119.24 to 121.79 degrees E across east China. A total of 36 plots 
      were investigated in the Liaohe River Estuary, the Yellow River Estuary, 
      Yancheng, and Hangzhou Bay in August 2020. We collected shoot, root, and 
      rhizosphere soil samples. the number of pakchoi leaves, total fresh and dry 
      weight of the seedlings was counted. The soil properties, plant functional 
      traits, the genome sequencing, and metabolomics assay were detected. RESULTS: The 
      results showed that soil nutrients (total organic carbon, dissolved organic 
      carbon, total nitrogen, soluble sugars, and organic acids) are high in the 
      temperate marsh, while root exudates (measured by metabolite expressions) are 
      significantly higher in the subtropical marsh. We observed higher bacterial alpha 
      diversity, more complex network structure, and more negative connections in the 
      temperate salt marsh, which suggested intense competition among bacterial groups. 
      Variation partitioning analysis showed that climatic, edaphic, and root exudates 
      had the greatest effects on the bacteria in the salt marsh, especially for 
      abundant and moderate subcommunities. Random forest modeling further confirmed 
      this but showed that plant species had a limited effect. CONCLUTIONS: Taken 
      together, the results of this study revealed soil properties (chemical 
      properties) and root exudates (metabolites) had the greatest influence on the 
      bacterial community of salt marsh, especially for abundant and moderate taxa. Our 
      results provided novel insights into the biogeography of halophyte microbiome in 
      coastal wetlands and can be beneficial for policymakers in decision-making on the 
      management of coastal wetlands.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Pinus yunnanensis is a major silvicultural species in Southwest 
      China. Currently, large areas of twisted-trunk Pinus yunnanensis stands severely 
      restrict its productivity. Different categories of rhizosphere microbes evolve 
      alongside plants and environments and play an important role in the growth and 
      ecological fitness of their host plant. However, the diversity and structure of 
      the rhizosphere microbial communities between P. yunnanensis with two different 
      trunk types-straight and twisted-remain unclear. METHODS: We collected the 
      rhizosphere soil of 5 trees with the straight and 5 trees with the twisted trunk 
      type in each of three sites in Yunnan province. We assessed and compared the 
      diversity and structure of the rhizosphere microbial communities between P. 
      yunnanensis with two different trunk types by Illumina sequencing of 16S rRNA 
      genes and internal transcribed spacer (ITS) regions. RESULTS: The available 
      phosphorus in soil differed significantly between P. yunnanensis with straight 
      and twisted trunks. Available potassium had a significant effect on fungi. 
      Chloroflexi dominated the rhizosphere soils of the straight trunk type, while 
      Proteobacteria was predominant in the rhizosphere soils of the twisted trunk 
      type. Trunk types significantly explained 6.79% of the variance in bacterial 
      communities. CONCLUSION: This study revealed the composition and diversity of 
      bacterial and fungal groups in the rhizosphere soil of P. yunnanensis with 
      straight and twisted trunk types, providing proper microbial information for 
      different plant phenotypes.

AB  - Rhizosphere microorganisms play a key role in affecting plant quality and 
      productivity through its interaction with plant root system. To figure out the 
      bottleneck of the decline of yield and quality in the traditional Chinese 
      medicinal herbs Glehnia littoralis they now encounter, it is important to study 
      the dynamics of rhizosphere microbiota during the cultivation of G. littoralis. 
      In the present study, the composition, diversity and function of rhizosphere 
      microbes at different development stages of G. littoralis, as well as the 
      correlation between rhizosphere microbes and environmental factors were 
      systematically studied by high-throughput sequencing. There were significant 
      differences between the rhizosphere microbes at early and middle-late development 
      stages. More beneficial bacteria, such as Proteobacteria, and more symbiotic and 
      saprophytic fungi were observed at the middle-late development stage of G. 
      littoralis, while beneficial bacteria such as Actinobacteria and polytrophic 
      transitional fungi were abundant at all development stages. The results of 
      redundancy analysis show that eight environmental factors drive the changes of 
      microflora at different development stages. pH, soil organic matter (SOM) and 
      available phosphorus (AP) had important positive effects on the bacterial and 
      fungal communities at the early development stage; saccharase (SC) and nitrate 
      nitrogen (NN) showed significant positive effects on the bacterial and fungal 
      communities at the middle and late stages; while urease (UE), available potassium 
      (AK), and alkaline phosphatase (AKP) have different effects on bacterial and 
      fungal communities at different development stages. Random forest analysis 
      identified 47 bacterial markers and 22 fungal markers that could be used to 
      distinguish G. littoralis at different development stages. Network analysis 
      showed that the rhizosphere microbes formed a complex mutualistic symbiosis 
      network, which is beneficial to the growth and development of G. littoralis. 
      These results suggest that host development stage and environmental factors have 
      profound influence on the composition, diversity, community structure and 
      function of plant rhizosphere microorganisms. This study provides a reference for 
      optimizing the cultivation of G. littoralis.

AB  - Root activity regulates rhizosphere soil carbon (C) dynamics, thereby profoundly 
      affecting soil C sequestration and associated climate feedback. However, whether 
      and how rhizosphere soil organic C (SOC) sequestration responds to atmospheric N 
      deposition remains unclear. We distinguished and quantified the direction and 
      magnitude of soil C sequestration between the rhizosphere and bulk soil of a 
      spruce (Picea asperata Mast.) plantation after 4-year field N additions. 
      Moreover, the contribution of microbial necromass C to SOC accumulation under N 
      addition was further compared between the two soil compartments, considering the 
      crucial role of microbial necromass in soil C formation and stabilization. The 
      results showed that although both the rhizosphere and bulk soil facilitated SOC 
      accumulation in response to N addition, the rhizosphere exerted a greater C 
      sequestration than that of bulk soil. Specifically, compared to the control, SOC 
      content increased 15.03 mg/g and 4.22 mg/g in the rhizosphere and bulk soil under 
      N addition, respectively. Further numerical model analysis showed that SOC pool 
      in the rhizosphere increased by 33.39 % induced by N addition, which was nearly 
      four times of that in the bulk soil (7.41 %). The contribution of increased 
      microbial necromass C to SOC accumulation induced by N addition was significantly 
      higher in the rhizosphere (38.76 %) than that in the bulk soil (31.31 %), which 
      was directly related to the greater accumulation of fungal necromass C in the 
      rhizosphere. Our findings highlighted the vital role of the rhizosphere processes 
      in regulating soil C dynamics under elevating N deposition, and also provided a 
      clear evidence for importance of the microbial-derived C in the SOC sequestration 
      from the rhizosphere perspective.

AB  - Rigidoporus microporus, which causes white root rot disease (WRD) in Hevea 
      brasiliensis, is a looming threat to rubber plantation in Malaysia. The current 
      study was conducted to determine and evaluate the efficiency of fungal 
      antagonists (Ascomycota) against R. microporus in rubber trees under laboratory 
      and nursery conditions. A total of 35 fungal isolates established from the rubber 
      tree rhizosphere soil were assessed for their antagonism against R. microporus by 
      the dual culture technique. Trichoderma isolates can inhibit the radial growth of 
      R. microporus by 75% or more in the dual culture test. Strains of T. asperellum, 
      T. koningiopsis, T. spirale, and T. reesei were selected to assess the 
      metabolites involved in their antifungal activity. Results indicated that T. 
      asperellum exhibited an inhibitory effect against R. microporus in both volatile 
      and non-volatile metabolite tests. All Trichoderma isolates were then tested for 
      their ability in producing hydrolytic enzymes such as chitinase, cellulase and 
      glucanase, indole acetic acid (IAA), siderophores production, and phosphate 
      solubilization. From the positive results of the biochemical assays, T. 
      asperellum and T. spirale were selected as the biocontrol candidates to be 
      further tested in vivo against R. microporus. The nursery assessments revealed 
      that rubber tree clone RRIM600 pretreated with only T. asperellum or with the 
      combination of T. asperellum and T. spirale was able to reduce the disease 
      severity index (DSI) and exert higher suppression of R. microporus compared to 
      other pretreated samples, with the average DSI below 30%. Collectively, the 
      present study demonstrates that T. asperellum represents a potential biocontrol 
      agent that should be further explored to control R. microporus infection on 
      rubber trees.

AB  - Ring nematodes are obligate ectoparasites on crops and natural herbaceous and 
      woody plants, and some species are of economic importance and cause damage to 
      roots of several crops. Recent integrative taxonomical analyses recognized the 
      existence of two cryptic species within the Criconema annuliferum morphotype in 
      Spain. In this study, we corroborated that morphometric, morphological and a 
      multi-locus analysis (including the ribosomal markers D2-D3 expansion segments of 
      28S rRNA, ITS rRNA, 18S RNA, and the mitochondrial DNA cytochrome oxidase I gene) 
      identified a new lineage clearly separated from C. annuliferum, C. 
      paraannuliferum and C. plesioannuliferum. The new lineage was described herein as 
      Criconema pseudoannuliferum sp. nov., confirming that C. annuliferum species 
      complex species complex comprises a hyper-cryptic species complex. This research 
      analysed soil samples from the rhizosphere of maritime pine (Pinus pinaster Ait.) 
      forests in Bermeja-Crestellina Mountain, located at the western part of Malaga 
      province, southern Spain. The integrative taxonomical analyses revealed the 
      occurrence of a new cryptic species identified using females, males and juveniles 
      with detailed morphology, morphometry and molecular markers, described herein as 
      Criconema pseudoannuliferum sp. nov. All molecular markers (D2-D3, ITS, 18S and 
      COI) were obtained from the same individual that was also used for morphological 
      and morphometric analyses. This research demonstrated the hidden diversity within 
      the C. annuliferum species complex species complex can reach to four lineages 
      under ribosomal and mitochondrial gene markers for one morphospecies group, which 
      includes four species, viz. C. annuliferum, C. paraannuliferum, C. 
      plesioannuliferum, and C. pseudoannuliferum sp. nov. Criconema pseudoannuliferum 
      sp. nov. was detected in moderate soil density in two maritime pine forests (5 
      and 25 nematodes/500 cm(3) of soil) suggesting that does not cause damage to 
      maritime pine.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Rhizobacterial communities and their metabolites can affect plant 
      growth, development, and stress resistance, as well as the biosynthesis and 
      accumulation of bioactive compounds in medicinal plants. This relationship has 
      been well-characterized in many medicinal herbs, although much less commonly in 
      medicinal trees. METHODS: Here, we analyzed the composition and structure of 
      Cinnamomum migao rhizobacterial communities across nine growing regions in 
      Yunnan, Guizhou and Guangxi, China, as well as differences in soil properties and 
      fruit bioactive compounds. RESULTS: Results showed that the C. migao 
      rhizobacterial communities exhibited high species richness, but location-specific 
      differences in structure. Site-specific differences in soil properties and 
      bioactive compounds were also observed. Furthermore, rhizobacterial community 
      compositions were correlated with both soil properties and fruit bioactive 
      compounds, metabolism-related functions were most common in C. migao 
      rhizobacteria. DISCUSSION: Several bacterial genera, including Acidothermus, 
      Acidibacter, Bryobacter, Candidatus_Solibacter, and Acidimicrobiales, potentially 
      promote the biosynthesis and accumulation of 1,8-cineole, cypressene, limonene, 
      and alpha-terpineol, Nitrospira and Alphaproteobacteria may play an inhibitory role. 
      Finally, our results emphasized the critical role that soil pH and nitrogen 
      levels play in driving rhizobacterial community structure, and specific 
      functional bacteria can also counteract with soil properties, Acidibacter and 
      Nitrospira can affect soil pH and nitrogen effectiveness. Overall, this study 
      provides additional insight into the complex correlation of rhizosphere 
      microorganisms with bioactive ingredients and soil properties of medicinal 
      plants.

TI  - Biostimulation of Salicornia europaea L. crops with plant growth-promoting

      profile.
LID - lxad036 [pii]
LID - 10.1093/jambio/lxad036 [doi]
AB  - AIM: The objective of the work was to assess the effect of biostimulation with 
      selected plant growth-promoting bacteria on growth and metabolite profile of 
      Salicornia europaea. METHODS AND RESULTS: Salicornia europaea seeds were 
      inoculated with different combinations of plant growth-promoting bacteria 
      Brevibacterium casei EB3, Pseudomonas oryzihabitans RL18, and Bacillus 
      aryabhattai SP20. Plants germinated from inoculated seeds were grown either in 
      laboratory conditions or in a saline crop field. Fresh and dry weight were 
      determined at the end of the experiment, for biomass quantification. The 
      microbiological quality of fresh shoots for human consumption as salad greens was 
      assessed, and the persistence of the inoculated strains in the plant rhizosphere 
      was confirmed by next-generation sequencing (Illumina) of the 16S rDNA gene. The 
      primary metabolite profile of biostimulated plants was characterized by 
      GC-TOF-MS.In laboratory conditions, inoculation with the two strains Br. casei 
      EB3 and Ps. oryzihabitans RL18 caused the most significant increase in biomass 
      production (fresh and dry weight), and caused a shift in the central metabolic 
      pathways of inoculated plants toward amino acid biosynthesis. In the field 
      experiment, no significant biostimulation effect was detected with any of the 
      tested inoculants. Seed inoculation had no significant effect on the 
      microbiological quality of the edible parts. The persistence of inoculants was 
      confirmed in both experiments. CONCLUSIONS: Manipulation of the plant microbiome 
      can trigger primary metabolic reconfiguration and modulate the plant metabolism 
      while promoting plant growth.

TI  - Gender Effects of Dioecious Plant Populus cathayana on Fungal Community and 
      Mycorrhizal Distribution at Different Arid Zones in Qinghai, China.

AB  - Dioecious plants have a wide distribution in nature and gender effect may cause 
      significant alterations in rhizosphere fungal community and soil properties. 
      However, little is known regarding changes in response to dioecious plants. This 
      study aimed to investigate the effects that the dioecious plant, Populus 
      cathayana, and regions of different arid levels have on the fungal community, 
      mycorrhizal distribution, soil enzymatic activities, and nutrient contents. This 
      study characterized fungal and soil factors from the rhizosphere of the dioecious 
      plant Populus cathayana located in the semi-humid regions (Chengguan), semi-arid 
      regions (Sining, Haiyan) and arid regions (Ulan, Chaka). Rhizosphere soil was 
      collected from each site and gender, and the total fungal genomic DNA was 
      extracted. DNA amplicons from fungal ITS region were generated and subjected to 
      Illumina Miseq sequencing. A total of 5 phyla, 28 classes, 92 orders, 170 
      families, and 380 genuses were observed. AMF distribution peaked at Chaka, which 
      did not conform to the trend. Gender had significant effects on fungal 
      communities: there were obvious differences in fungal OTUs between genders. Alpha 
      diversity raised at first and then decreased. RDA results showed available P, 
      available K, pH, ALP activity, ammonium N, EC, water content and catalase 
      activity were the key contributors in sample areas. Our results suggested 
      potential interaction effects between plant gender and fungal community.

AB  - Soil fungi play an important role in nutrient cycling, mycorrhizal symbiosis, 
      antagonism against pathogens, and organic matter decomposition. However, our 
      knowledge about the community characteristics of soil fungi in relation to bamboo 
      varieties is still limited. Here, we compared the fungal communities in different 
      soil compartments (rhizosphere vs. bulk soil) of moso bamboo (Phyllostachys 
      edulis) and its four varieties using ITS high-throughput sequencing technology. 
      The fungal alpha diversity (Shannon index) in bulk soil was significantly higher than 
      that in rhizosphere soil, but it was not affected by bamboo variety or 
      interactions between the soil compartment and bamboo variety. Soil compartment 
      and bamboo variety together explained 31.74% of the variation in fungal community 
      diversity. Soil compartment and bamboo variety were the key factors affecting the 
      relative abundance of the major fungal taxa at the phylum and genus levels. Soil 
      compartment mainly affected the relative abundance of the dominant fungal phylum, 
      while bamboo variety primarily influenced the dominant fungal genus. Network 
      analysis showed that the fungal network in rhizosphere soil was more complex, 
      stable, and connected than that in bulk soil. A FUNGuild database analysis 
      indicated that both soil compartment and bamboo variety affect fungal functions. 
      Our findings provide new insights into the roles of both soil compartments and 
      plant species (including variety) in shaping soil fungal communities.

AB  - Few studies have focused on the growth, soil quality and sustainability of 
      medicinal plants under different soil conditions. In this study, the spatial 
      heterogeneity of soil physical and chemical properties, the diversity of 
      rhizosphere soil microbial community structure, and the characteristics of growth 
      of the wild and cultivated medicinal plant, Siberian fritillary (Fritillaria 
      pallidiflora Schrek) were analyzed, and the soil quality and ecosystem 
      sustainability were comprehensively evaluated. The results showed that there was 
      significant spatial variability of soil nutrients in the different habitats. 
      Nitrate nitrogen (NO(3)-N) was strongly variable, while those of the soil organic 
      carbon (SOC) and available phosphorus (AP) were moderately variable. There was 
      little variability among the soil available potassium (AK), electrical 
      conductivity (EC), pH and ammonium nitrogen (NH(4)-N). Inverse Distance Weighting 
      spatial interpolation showed that SOC, NO(3)-N, NH(4)-H and EC were highly 
      distributed in the southeastern part of the wild area, and the soil was more 
      acidic in the original habitat than in the planting habitat. There was little AK 
      and AP in the native habitat, and there was a high content in the planting 
      habitat. Simultaneously, the soil microbial communities of the two soils also 
      differed. The wild-type soil showed a "fungal" type, while the planted soil 
      showed a "bacterial" type. Pathogenic bacteria were among the primary microflora 
      in the planting area. In general, it is difficult to maintain the sustainable 
      development and geo-herbalism of F. pallidiflora in today's cultivation mode 
      because of the significant differences in soil nature, spatial heterogeneity and 
      microbial community structure for the growth of F. pallidiflora. Therefore, 
      future planting should focus on transforming it from intensive to mountain forest 
      planting. This is highly significant for improving the planting efficiency of F. 
      pallidiflora, protecting their geo-herbalism and germplasm resources, and 
      maintaining the stability and sustainable development of the ecosystem.

TI  - Plant Disease Resistance-Related Pathways Recruit Beneficial Bacteria by 
      Remodeling Root Exudates upon Bacillus cereus AR156 Treatment.

AB  - The environmentally friendly biological control strategy that relies on 
      beneficial bacterial inoculants to improve plant disease resistance is a 
      promising strategy. Previously, it has been demonstrated that biocontrol bacteria 
      treatments can change the plant rhizosphere microbiota but whether plant 
      signaling pathways, especially those related to disease resistance, mediate the 
      changes in rhizosphere microbiota has not been explored. Here, we investigated 
      the complex interplay among biocontrol strains, plant disease resistance-related 
      pathways, root exudates, rhizosphere microorganisms, and pathogens to further 
      clarify the biocontrol mechanism of biocontrol bacteria by using plant signaling 
      pathway mutants. Bacillus cereus AR156, which was previously isolated from forest 
      soil by our laboratory, can significantly control tomato bacterial wilt disease 
      in greenhouse and field experiments. Moreover, compared with the control 
      treatment, the B. cereus AR156 treatment had a significant effect on the soil 
      microbiome and recruited 35 genera of bacteria to enrich the rhizosphere of 
      tomato. Among them, the relative rhizosphere abundance of nine genera, including 
      Ammoniphilus, Bacillus, Bosea, Candidimonas, Flexivirga, Brevundimonas, 
      Bordetella, Dyella, and Candidatus_Berkiella, was regulated by plant disease 
      resistance-related signaling pathways and B. cereus AR156. Linear correlation 
      analysis showed that the relative abundances of six genera in the rhizosphere 
      were significantly negatively correlated with pathogen colonization in roots. 
      These rhizosphere bacteria were affected by plant root exudates that are 
      regulated by signaling pathways. IMPORTANCE Our data suggest that B. cereus AR156 
      can promote the enrichment of beneficial microorganisms in the plant rhizosphere 
      by regulating salicylic acid (SA) and jasmonic acid (JA)/ethylene (ET) signaling 
      pathways in plants, thereby playing a role in controlling bacterial wilt disease. 
      Meanwhile, Spearman correlation analysis showed that the relative abundances of 
      these beneficial bacteria were correlated with the secretion of root exudates. 
      Our study reveals a new mechanism for SA and JA/ET signals to participate in the 
      adjustment of plant resistance whereby the signaling pathways adjust the 
      rhizosphere microecology by changing the root exudates and thus change plant 
      resistance. On the other hand, biocontrol strains can utilize this mechanism to 
      recruit beneficial bacteria by activating disease resistance-related signaling 
      pathways to confine the infection and spread of pathogens. Finally, our data also 
      provide a new idea for the in-depth study of biocontrol mechanisms.

AB  - Thinning is an important silvicultural practice for improving the productivity 
      and wood production in plantation forest. Different intensities of thinning 
      management can affect tree growth and alter soil nutrient effectiveness, thus 
      affecting soil fungal community structure and diversity. Our objective is to 
      determine the soil factors and their regulatory mechanisms that influence stand 
      growth by thinning, and to provide data to support the establishment of large 
      diameter timber cultivation technology for Picea koraiensis. In this study, we 
      conducted medium- and high-intensity thinning in 43a P. koraiensis plantation 
      middle-aged forests and investigated the growth indexes, soil physicochemical 
      properties, and fungal community diversity in rhizosphere and non-rhizosphere 
      soils of the stands after thinning at different densities (904 plants/ha for 
      control, 644 plants/ha for 30% thinning intensity, and 477 plants/ha for 50% 
      thinning intensity). The results showed that all growth indicators (annual growth 
      of tree height, diameter at breast height, height under live branches and crown 
      width) of the plantation after high-intensity thinning (477 plants/ha) were 
      higher than those of the control (no thinning, significant) and medium-intensity 
      thinning (644 plants/ha). Mycorrhizal infection rate was higher at the beginning 
      of the growing season than at the end of the growing season, and increased 
      slightly with decreasing stand density. Compared to the control, all medium- and 
      high-intensity thinning treatments significantly improved soil nutrient content 
      (P < 0.05), including total carbon, total nitrogen, total phosphorus, total 
      potassium, Available phosphorus and Available potassium. Fungal diversity was 
      higher but lower in abundance than the control in both rhizosphere and 
      non-rhizosphere soils after thinning. The number of OTUs and fungal richness and 
      diversity indices of non-rhizosphere soil fungi were higher than those of 
      rhizosphere soil fungi. In conclusion, this study provides new evidence that 
      reasonable intercalation can increase the radial and vertical growth of P. 
      koraiensis plantation forests and promote the diversity of subsurface soil fungal 
      communities. It is shown that thinning intensity regulates biogeochemical cycles 
      in P. koraiensis plantation ecosystems by affecting soil nutrients and fungal 
      community structure. Therefore, 50% thinning intensity can be used to increase 
      timber production in plantation forests during large diameter timber cultivation 
      of P. koraiensis and improve predictions associated with achieving long-term 
      forest management strategies.

AB  - Legumes such as clover are cost-effective and environmentally friendly components 
      of strategies for remediating soils contaminated with heavy metals or organic 
      pollutants. However, the mechanisms by which clover remediates co-contaminated 
      soils are unclear. The present study explored the effects of phytoremediation by 
      clover on pollutant removal and the microbial community in soil co-contaminated 
      with cadmium (Cd) and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs). After 18 months of 
      phytoremediation, Cd removal increased from 20.25 % in the control to 40.65 % in 
      soil planted with clover, while PCB removal increased from 29.81 % to 60.02 %. 
      High-throughput sequencing analysis showed that the relative abundances of the 
      bacterial phylum Proteobacteria and the diazotrophic genus Rhizobium increased 
      significantly after phytoremediation. Random forest analysis showed that 
      bacterial and diazotrophic diversity significantly influenced Cd and PCB removal. 
      Furthermore, co-occurrence network and correlation analyses revealed that 
      Rhizobiales and Micromonosporales were the main bacteria associated with Cd 
      removal, while Rhizobiales, Burkholderiales, and Xanthomonadales were identified 
      as the main degraders of PCBs. PICRUSt functional prediction demonstrated that 
      the gene bphC, which is related to PCB degradation, was significantly increased 
      in the rhizosphere soil in the presence of clover. These results provide a better 
      understanding for further studies of remediation efficiency by clover, 
      rhizosphere microbial response and remediation mechanisms of co-contaminated 
      soils under in situ conditions in the field.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Assembly and co-occurrence of the host co-evolved microbiota are 
      essential ecological and evolutionary processes, which is not only crucial for 
      managing individual plant fitness but also ecological function. However, 
      understanding of the microbiome assembly and co-occurrence in higher plants is 
      not well understood. The tea plant was shown to contribute the forest fitness due 
      to the microbiome assembled in the phyllosphere; the landscape of microbiome 
      assembly in the tea plants and its potential implication on phyllosphere 
      homestasis still remains untangled. OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to deciphering 
      of the microbiome networks of the tea plants at a continental scale. It would 
      provide fundamental insights into the factors driving the microbiome assembly, 
      with an extended focus on the resilience towards the potential pathogen in the 
      phyllosphere. METHODS: We collected 225 samples from 45 locations spanning 
      approximately 2000-km tea growing regions across China. By integration of 
      high-throughput sequencing data, physicochemical properties profiling and 
      bioinformatics analyses, we investigated continental scale microbiome assembly 
      and co-occurrence in the tea plants. Synthetic assemblages, interaction assay and 
      RT-qPCR were further implemented to analyze the microbial interaction indexed in 
      phyllosphere. RESULTS: A trade-off between stochastic and deterministic processes 
      in microbiomes community assembly was highlighted. Assembly processes were 
      dominated by deterministic processes in bulk and rhizosphere soils, and followed 
      by stochastic processes in roots and leaves with amino acids as critical drivers 
      for environmental selection. Sphingobacteria and Proteobacteria ascended from 
      soils to leaves to sustain a core leaf taxa. The core taxa formed a close 
      association with a prevalent foliar pathogen in the co-occurrence network and 
      significantly attenuated the expression of a set of essential virulence genes in 
      pathogen. CONCLUSION: Our study unveils the mechanism underpinning microbiome 
      assembly in the tea plants, and a potential implication of the 
      microbiome-mediated resilience framework on the phyllosphere homeostasis.

TI  - Streptomyces sp. Strain PBR11, a Forest-Derived Soil Actinomycetia with 
      Antimicrobial Potential.
PG  - e0348922

LID - e03489-22
AB  - The Actinomycetia isolate PBR11 was isolated from the forest rhizosphere soil of 
      Pobitora Wildlife Sanctuary (PWS), Assam, India. The isolate was identified as 
      Streptomyces sp. with 92.91% sequence similarity to their closest type strain, 
      Streptomyces atrovirens NRRL B-16357 DQ026672. The strain demonstrated 
      significant antimicrobial activity against 19 test pathogens, including 
      multidrug-resistant (MDR) clinical isolates and dermatophytes. Phenol, 
      2,5-bis(1,1-dimethylethyl), is the major chemical compound detected by gas 
      chromatography-mass spectrometry in the ethyl acetate extract of PBR11 
      (EtAc-PBR11). The presence of the PKS type II gene (type II polyketide synthases) 
      and chitinase gene suggested that it has been involved in the production of 
      antimicrobial compounds. Metabolic profiling of the EtAc-PBR11 was performed by 
      thin-layer chromatography and flash chromatography resulted in the extraction of 
      two bioactive fractions, namely, PBR11Fr-1 and PBR11Fr-2. Liquid 
      chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry analysis of both the fractions 
      demonstrated the presence of significant antimicrobial compounds, including 
      ethambutol. This is the first report on the detection of antituberculosis drug in 
      the bioactive fractions of Streptomyces sp. PBR11. EtAc-PBR11 and PBR11Fr-1 
      showed the lowest MIC values (>0.097 and >0.048 mug/mL, respectively) against 
      Candida albicans MTCC 227, whereas they showed the highest MIC values (>0.390 and 
      >0.195 mug/mL, respectively) against Escherichia coli ATCC BAA-2469. The effects 
      of PBR11Fr-1 were investigated on the pathogens by using a scanning electron 
      microscope. The results indicated major morphological alterations in the 
      cytoplasmic membrane. PBR11Fr-1 exhibited low cytotoxicity on normal hepatocyte 
      cell line (CC-1) and the percent cell viability started to decline as the 
      concentration increased from 50 mug/mL (87.07% +/- 3.22%) to 100 mug/mL 
      (81.26% +/- 2.99%). IMPORTANCE Novel antibiotic breakthroughs are urgently required 
      to combat antimicrobial resistance. Actinomycetia are the principal producers of 
      antibiotics. The present study demonstrated the broad-spectrum antimicrobial 
      potential of an Actinomycetia strain Streptomyces sp. strain PBR11 isolated from 
      the PWS of Assam, India, which represents diverse, poorly screened habitats for 
      novel microorganisms. The strain displayed 92.4% sequence similarity with genes 
      of the closest type strain, indicating that the strain may represent a novel 
      taxon within the phylum Actinomycetota. The metabolomics studies of EtAc-PBR11 
      revealed structurally diverse antimicrobial agents, including the detection of 
      the antituberculosis drug ethambutol, in the bioactive fraction of Streptomyces 
      sp. PBR11 for the first time. The PBR11 strain also yielded positive results for 
      the antibiotic synthesis gene and the chitinase gene, both of which are 
      responsible for broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity. This suggests that the 
      untouched forest ecosystems have a tremendous potential to harbor potent 
      actinomycetia for future drug discovery.

TI  - Species of fast bulk-soil nutrient cycling have lower rhizosphere effects: A 
      nutrient spectrum of rhizosphere effects.
PG  - e3981
LID - 10.1002/ecy.3981 [doi]
AB  - Tree roots not only acquire readily-usable soil nutrients but also affect 
      microbial decomposition and manipulate nutrient availability in their surrounding 
      soils, that is, rhizosphere effects (REs). Thus, REs challenge the basic 
      understanding of how plants adapt to the environment and co-exist with other 
      species. Yet, how REs vary among species in response to species-specific bulk 
      soil nutrient cycling is not well-known. Here, we studied how plant-controlled 
      microbial decomposition activities in rhizosphere soils respond to those in their 
      corresponding bulk soils and whether these relations depend on species-specific 
      nutrient cycling in the bulk soils. We targeted 55 woody species of different 
      clades and mycorrhizal types in three contrasting biomes, namely a temperate 
      forest, a subtropical forest, and a tropical forest. We found that microbial 
      decomposition activities in rhizosphere soils responded linearly to those in 
      their corresponding bulk soils at the species level. Thereafter, we found that 
      REs (parameters in rhizosphere soils minus those in corresponding bulk soils) of 
      microbial decomposition activities had negative linear correlations with 
      microbial decomposition activities in corresponding bulk soils. A multiple factor 
      analysis revealed that soil organic carbon, total nitrogen, and soil water 
      content favored bulk soil decomposition activities in all three biomes, showing 
      that the magnitude of REs varied along a fast-slow nutrient cycling spectrum in 
      bulk soils. The species of fast nutrient cycling in their bulk soils tended to 
      have smaller or even negative REs. Therefore, woody plants commonly utilize both 
      positive and negative REs as a nutrient-acquisition strategy. Based on the 
      trade-offs between REs and other nutrient-acquisition strategies, we proposed a 
      push and pull conceptual model which can bring plant nutrient-acquisition cost 
      and plant carbon economics spectrum together in the future. This model will 
      facilitate not only the carbon and nutrient cycling but also the mechanisms of 
      species co-existence in forest ecosystems.

AB  - While investigating the role of the rhizosphere in the development of Acute Oak 
      Decline, bacterial strains belonging to the family Enterobacteriaceae were 
      isolated from rhizosphere soil following enrichment for the Enterobacterales. 
      Partial sequencing of several housekeeping genes showed that these strains could 
      not be assigned to an existing genus. Overall, 16 strains were investigated using 
      a polyphasic approach to determine their taxonomic status. This involved 
      phenotypic testing and fatty acid analysis paired with phylogenetic analyses of 
      16S rRNA and housekeeping gene sequences, as well as phylogenomic analysis of 
      whole genome sequences. Phylogenomic and phylogenetic analyses consistently 
      demonstrated that the 16 isolates could be separated into two distinct clusters 
      in a monophyletic clade situated between the genera Cedecea and Buttiauxella. The 
      two clusters could be genotypically and phenotypically differentiated from each 
      other and from their closest neighbours. As such we propose the description of 
      Dryocola boscaweniae gen. nov. sp. nov. (type strain H6W4(T) = CCUG 
      76177(T) = LMG 32610(T)) and Dryocola clanedunesis sp. nov. (type strain 
      H11S18(T) = CCUG 76181(T) = LMG 32611(T)).

TI  - Response of Rhizosphere Bacterial Communities to Near-Natural Forest Management 
      and Tree Species within Chinese Fir Plantations.

AB  - Near-natural forest management plays an important role in the maintenance of the 
      long-term productivity and soil fertility of plantations. We conducted 
      high-throughput absolute quantitative sequencing of 16S rRNA genes to compare the 
      structures and diversity of rhizosphere soil bacterial communities among a pure 
      Chinese fir (Cunninghamia lanceolata) plantation (S), a Cunninghamia 
      lanceolata-Castanopsis hystrix-Michelia hedyosperma mixed plantation (SHX), and a 
      Cunninghamia lanceolata-Castanopsis fissa mixed plantation (SD). The results 
      revealed that near-natural forest management improved the rhizosphere soil 
      properties of Chinese fir, especially the phosphorus content. Rhizosphere soil 
      bacterial communities of Chinese fir in SHX and SD contained higher total 
      absolute abundances and more unique operational taxonomic units (OTUs) than the 
      pure plantation forest. Planctomycetes and Actinobacteria were abundant in SD, 
      and Actinobacteria were enriched in SHX. The tree species also had an impact on 
      the rhizosphere soil bacterial communities. For the rhizosphere soils of 
      different tree species of SHX, the available phosphorus (AP) content of the 
      rhizosphere of Chinese fir significantly surpassed those of Castanopsis hystrix 
      and Michelia hedyosperma. Bacteria related to nitrogen fixing, such as 
      Burkholderiales and Rhizobiales, were more abundant in Chinese fir in SD than in 
      Castanopsis fissa. Acdiobacteria and Proteobacteria underpinned the differences 
      found in the compositions of soil bacteria. The pH and soil organic matter were 
      key variables influencing the rhizosphere soil bacterial communities. Our results 
      demonstrated that in Chinese fir plantations, 12 years of near-natural management 
      of introduced broad-leaved tree species can drive alterations of the 
      physicochemical characteristics, bacterial community structure, and composition 
      of rhizosphere soil, with tree species identity further influencing the 
      rhizosphere soil bacterial community. IMPORTANCE Near-natural forest management 
      is an important way to change the soil fertility decline and productivity 
      reduction of pure Chinese fir plantations. At present, many detailed studies have 
      been carried out on the impact of near-natural forest management on Chinese fir 
      plantations at home and abroad. However, there are still few studies on the 
      response of rhizosphere bacterial communities to near-natural forest management. 
      Our study determined absolute quantities of Chinese fir rhizosphere bacterial 
      communities in different mixed patterns. The results underscore the importance of 
      near-natural forest management for Chinese fir plantation rhizosphere bacterial 
      communities and provide new information on soil factors that affect rhizosphere 
      bacterial communities in South China.

AB  - Malus sieversii (Ldb.) Roem. is the original species of modern cultivated apple 
      and a key national essential conservation plant in China. In recent years, 
      degradation and death of wild apple has been exacerbated by imbalances in the 
      rhizosphere micro-ecosystems of wild apple forests due to soil nutrient loss, 
      grazing, climate change and pest and disease outbreaks. However, the structure, 
      diversity and response to environmental factors of wild apple rhizosphere 
      microbial communities are so far unclear. In this study, the rhizosphere 
      bacterial and eukaryotic communities of M. sieversii (Ldb.) Roem. in eight 
      regions of the Yili River were analyzed using 16S/18S rDNA high-throughput 
      sequencing technology. The results indicated that the bacterial operational 
      taxonomic units (OTUs), Shannon index, and community composition were 
      significantly lower in regions A, E, and F than in other regions. By contrast, 
      the dominant eukaryotic communities in all regions were relatively similar in 
      composition and differed less than the relative abundance of bacterial 
      communities. Geographical and climatic distance were found to be key factors 
      influencing the composition and diversity of wild apple rhizosphere microbial 
      communities through mantel analysis. Moreover, these factors above were more 
      correlated with bacterial diversity than with eukaryotes. This study identified 
      the structure of wild apple rhizosphere microbial communities in Xinjiang and 
      their interaction mechanisms under geographical and environmental gradients. It 
      provides guidance for the sustainable management and ecological construction of 
      wild apple forests in China.

TI  - Effect of Parthenium hysterophorus L. Invasion on Soil Microbial Communities in 
      the Yellow River Delta, China.
LID - 10.3390/microorganisms11010018 [doi]
LID - 18
AB  - Parthenium hysterophorus L., as an invasive plant, has negatively impacted the 
      ecosystem functioning and stability of the terrestrial ecosystem in China. 
      However, little information was available for its effects on microorganisms in 
      the Yellow River Delta (YRD), the biggest newly-formed wetland in China. In the 
      present study, high-throughput sequencing technology was used to obtain the 
      bacterial community in soils and roots of different plant species, including P. 
      hysterophorus and some native ones in the YRD. Our results showed that the 
      Proteobacteria, Acidobacteriota, Gemmatimonadota, and Actinobacteriota were 
      dominant in the rhizosphere soils of P. hysterophorus (84.2%) and Setaria viridis 
      (86.47%), and the bulk soils (80.7%). The Proteobacteria and Actinobacteriota 
      were dominant within the root of P. hysterophorus. A total of 2468 bacterial OTUs 
      were obtained from different groups among which 140 were observed in all the 
      groups; 1019 OTUs were shared by P. hysterophorus non-rhizosphere soil bacteria 
      (YNR) P. hysterophorus rhizosphere soil bacteria (YRR) groups. The indexes of the 
      ACE (823.1), Chao1 (823.19), Simpson (0.9971), and Shannon (9.068) were the 
      highest in the YRR groups, showing the greatest bacterial community diversity. 
      Random forest analysis showed that the Methylomirabilota and Dadabacteria (at the 
      phylum level) and the Sphingomonas, and Woeseia (at the genus level) were 
      identified as the main predictors among different groups. The LEfSe results also 
      showed the essential role of the Acidobacteriota in the YRR group. The 
      SourceTracker analysis of the bacterial community of the YRR group was mainly 
      from GBS groups (average 53.14%) and a small part was from YNR groups (average 
      6.56%), indicating that the P. hysterophorus invasion had a more significant 
      effect on native plants' rhizosphere microorganisms than soil microorganisms. Our 
      observations could provide valuable information for understanding the bacterial 
      diversity and structure of the soil to the invasion of P. hysterophorus.

TI  - Interactions between epiphytes during canopy soil formation: an experiment in a 
      lower montane cloud forest of southeast Mexico.
PG  - 468-477
LID - 10.1111/plb.13501 [doi]
AB  - In several montane forests around the world, epiphytes coexist in mats, sharing 
      the rhizosphere and forming histosol-type soils rich in nutrients. The role of 
      these epiphytes in the formation of canopy soil and the fitness costs that 
      epiphytes face when cohabiting in these mats are unknown. In a lower montane 
      cloud forest in central Veracruz, Mexico, a 2-year factorial experiment was 
      carried out with the presence/absence of ramets of Phlebodium areolatum 
      (Polypodiaceae), Tillandsia kirchhoffiana, T. multicaulis and T. punctulata 
      (Bromeliaceae). We examined (i) which epiphyte species contribute to the 
      formation of canopy soil, (ii) the role of epiphyte composition in the soil 
      nutrient composition, and (iii) the fitness costs faced by epiphytes when 
      cohabiting. Canopy soil formation highest when P. areolatum is present. Soil 
      nutrient content does not change with epiphyte composition, is influenced by the 
      microbiota, and P content decreases with the presence of epiphytes. The fitness 
      costs show that the species compete, decreasing their survival and growth, but 
      the competitive capacity differs between the species. We conclude that P. 
      areolatum is an ecosystem engineer that promotes the creation of canopy soil but 
      is a poor competitor. The results coincide with the model of succession by 
      facilitation. Canopy soil is a slow-created component whose nutrient content does 
      not depend on the epiphytic flora. In epiphyte mats, the dominant interactions 
      are competitive, but there is also facilitation.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The design of ecologically sustainable and plant-beneficial soil 
      systems is a key goal in actively manipulating root-associated microbiomes. 
      Community engineering efforts commonly seek to harness the potential of the 
      indigenous microbiome through substrate-mediated recruitment of beneficial 
      members. In most sustainable practices, microbial recruitment mechanisms rely on 
      the application of complex organic mixtures where the resources/metabolites that 
      act as direct stimulants of beneficial groups are not characterized. Outcomes of 
      such indirect amendments are unpredictable regarding engineering the microbiome 
      and achieving a plant-beneficial environment. RESULTS: This study applied network 
      analysis of metagenomics data to explore amendment-derived transformations in the 
      soil microbiome, which lead to the suppression of pathogens affecting apple root 
      systems. Shotgun metagenomic analysis was conducted with data from 'sick' vs 
      'healthy/recovered' rhizosphere soil microbiomes. The data was then converted 
      into community-level metabolic networks. Simulations examined the functional 
      contribution of treatment-associated taxonomic groups and linked them with 
      specific amendment-induced metabolites. This analysis enabled the selection of 
      specific metabolites that were predicted to amplify or diminish the abundance of 
      targeted microbes functional in the healthy soil system. Many of these 
      predictions were corroborated by experimental evidence from the literature. The 
      potential of two of these metabolites (dopamine and vitamin B(12)) to either 
      stimulate or suppress targeted microbial groups was evaluated in a follow-up set 
      of soil microcosm experiments. The results corroborated the stimulant's potential 
      (but not the suppressor) to act as a modulator of plant beneficial bacteria, 
      paving the way for future development of knowledge-based (rather than trial and 
      error) metabolic-defined amendments. Our pipeline for generating predictions for 
      the selective targeting of microbial groups based on processing assembled and 
      annotated metagenomics data is available at https://github.com/ot483/NetCom2 . 
      CONCLUSIONS: This research demonstrates how genomic-based algorithms can be used 
      to formulate testable hypotheses for strategically engineering the rhizosphere 
      microbiome by identifying specific compounds, which may act as selective 
      modulators of microbial communities. Applying this framework to reduce 
      unpredictable elements in amendment-based solutions promotes the development of 
      ecologically-sound methods for re-establishing a functional microbiome in agro 
      and other ecosystems. Video Abstract.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Microbial communities in the plant rhizosphere are critical for 
      nutrient cycling and ecosystem stability. However, how root exudates and soil 
      physicochemical characteristics affect microbial community composition in Populus 
      rhizosphere is not well understood. METHODS: This study measured soil 
      physiochemistry properties and root exudates in a representative forest consists 
      of four Populus species. The composition of rhizosphere bacterial and fungal 
      communities was determined by metabolomics and high-throughput sequencing. 
      RESULTS: Luvangetin, salicylic acid, gentisic acid, oleuropein, strigol, chrysin, 
      and linoleic acid were the differential root exudates extracted in the 
      rhizosphere of four Populus species, which explained 48.40, 82.80, 48.73, and 
      59.64% of the variance for the dominant and key bacterial or fungal communities, 
      respectively. Data showed that differential root exudates were the main drivers 
      of the changes in the rhizosphere microbial communities. Nitrosospira, 
      Microvirga, Trichoderma, Cortinarius, and Beauveria were the keystone taxa in the 
      rhizosphere microbial communities, and are thus important for maintaining a 
      stable Populus microbial rhizosphere. The differential root exudates had strong 
      impact on key bacteria than dominant bacteria, key fungi, and dominant fungi. 
      Moreover, strigol had positively effects with bacteria, whereas phenolic 
      compounds and chrysin were negatively correlated with rhizosphere microorganisms. 
      The assembly process of the community structure (keystone taxa and bacterial 
      dominant taxa) was mostly determined by stochastic processes. DISCUSSION: This 
      study showed the association of rhizosphere microorganisms (dominant and keystone 
      taxa) with differential root exudates in the rhizosphere of Populus plants, and 
      revealed the assembly process of the dominant and keystone taxa. It provides a 
      theoretical basis for the identification and utilization of beneficial 
      microorganisms in Populus rhizosphere.

AB  - The under-forest economy in the agroforestry system can improve land use 
      efficiency, protect ecological environment, and promote arable land sustainable 
      development. However, the effects of soil moisture in the forest and irrigation 
      strategies on the healthy growth of intercropping crops are still incomplete. 
      Here, considering the organic Panax notoginseng cultivated under pine forests 
      (PPF) as the research object, we explored the effects of different soil moisture 
      on the physiological state, yield, quality and disease occurrence of PPF. Our 
      results suggested that 80-85% and 95-100% field capacity (FC) treatments were 
      more conducive to increased photosynthetic rate and biomass accumulation of PPF, 
      but 50-55% and 65-70% FC treatments were more conducive to the accumulation of 
      saponins in PPF leaves. Notably, the root rot index of PPF was highest under 
      95-100% FC (19.51) treatment, significantly higher than that under 65-70% FC 
      (8.44) and 80-85% FC (10.21) treatments. Further, the rhizosphere microorganisms 
      of PPF under different soil moisture treatments were sequenced, and the 
      sequencing data analysis revealed that high soil moisture (95-100% FC) could 
      destroy the microbial diversity balance and cause the accumulation of pathogens 
      (Fusarium oxysporum and Ilyonectria radicicola), leading to a high incidence of 
      root rot. The incidence of PPF root rot was negatively correlated with 
      rhizosphere microbial diversity. Overall, our results highlight that the 
      quantitative irrigation (80-85% FC) is conducive to maintaining the balance 
      between yield, saponin content and disease occurrence of PPF, providing a 
      practical basis for PPF irrigation strategy and promoting the sustainable 
      development of PPF agroforestry system.

AB  - Organic fertilization is a major contributor to the spread of antibiotic 
      resistance genes (ARGs) in the agroecosystem, which substantially increases the 
      risk of ARGs acquisition and their transmission into human food chains. 
      Earthworms are among the most vital soil faunas involved in the link between 
      belowground and aboveground, and silicon is beneficial for soil health and plant 
      stress resistance. This study aims to explore the effect of different amendment 
      strategies (earthworm and/or silicon) and the related influencing factors on the 
      alleviation of ARGs using high-throughput qPCR. The results showed that the 
      application of earthworms and silicon fertilizers reduced the absolute abundance 
      of ARGs in the rhizosphere soils, either singly or in combination. According to 
      the structural equation model and random forest analysis, mobile genetic elements 
      are the major factors enhancing ARGs transfers and the treatment affects ARGs in 
      direct or indirect ways. Our results highlight the role of "rhizosphere effect" 
      in alleviating antibiotic resistance and suggest that silicon fertilizers, 
      together with the earthworms, can be considered as a sustainable and natural 
      solution to mitigate high-risk ARGs spread in the soil-plant systems. Our 
      findings provide guidance in formulating strategies for halting the spread of 
      ARGs in the agroecosystem.

AB  - The Mediterranean basin is drastically affected by intense and frequent droughts, 
      which jeopardize the diversity and survival of its forest, for example, Pinus 
      pinaster forests. The dynamics of the bacterial communities inhabiting the 
      rhizosphere of Pinus pinaster and other plants from a pine dominated forest under 
      contrasting hydric conditions was monitored. The forest was located in Sierra de 
      Oria (southeast Spain), and it was mainly composed by P. pinaster, P. halepensis, 
      woody shrub species and herbaceous plants. 18 trees visually belonging to P. 
      pinaster located along the perimeter and across the forest were selected for the 
      analysis. All the trees were separated at least 50 m each other. Although all of 
      them belonged to P. pinaster morphologically according to visual identification, 
      the genotyping of the roots confirmed that they corresponded to P. pinaster, P. 
      halepensis, and other plant species different from genus Pinus, although in the 
      last case it was not possible to identify the plant species. At a distance less 
      than 50 cm from the trunk, the litter and topsoil were removed, and the soil 
      closely attached to non-suberified roots (rhizosphere soil) was collected (depth 
      of 5-25 cm). Sampling was carried out in two seasons with contrasting temperature 
      and rainfall patterns: on July 18, 2017 (summer) and April 24, 2018 (spring). 
      After rhizosphere soil DNA and RNA extraction (and cDNA synthesis), a 
      metabarcoding approach was followed by sequencing the V3-V4 hypervariable regions 
      of the 16S rRNA gene and its derived transcripts by Illumina MiSeq platform. 
      Sequencing reads were bioinformatically processed; specifically, they were 
      filtered, trimmed, clustered into ASV (Amplicon Sequence Variants), and 
      taxonomically identified. As a result, a total of 1,123,209 and 1,089,359 quality 
      sequences were obtained from DNA and RNA-derived libraries, which resulted in 
      5,241 and 5,231 ASVs, respectively. Total communities (DNA) were mainly dominated 
      by phyla Proteobacteria, Acidobacteria, Actinobacteria, Verrucomicrobia and 
      Bacteroidetes in summer and spring, while potentially active populations (RNA 
      libraries) were rich in Proteobacteria, Acidobacteria, Candidate division WPS-1, 
      Actinobacteria and Verrucomicrobia both in summer and spring. On the other hand, 
      DNA libraries were mainly dominated by genera Sphingomonas and acidobacterial 
      groups Gp4 and Gp6, while potentially active bacteria (RNA) were rich in 
      acidobacterial Gp3, Gp4, Gp6 and Phenylobacterium, although their relative 
      abundance depended on the considered season. This dataset can provide valuable 
      information about bacterial candidates which could be used as bioindicators of 
      drought conditions. In addition to shifts in the bacterial relative abundance due 
      to seasonal changes, the ratio RNA-based cDNA:DNA could be calculated as proxy of 
      the potential activity of bacterial taxa. Moreover, these data could aid in 
      developing bioformulations based on microorganisms which could be resistant to 
      desiccation and involved in the drought resistance mechanisms of the host plant.

AB  - Applying plant growth-promoting rhizobacteria (PGPR) improves the efficiency of 
      soil-borne disease control and is considered a sustainable practice. However, the 
      effect of PGPR on the fungal community, especially pathogenic fungi and 
      arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF), remains unclear. In this study, we examined 
      the effects of a compound microbial agent (consisting of Bacillus subtilis HG-15 
      and Bacillus velezensis JC-K3) on the incidence and yield of wheat under low salt 
      stress, as well as compared the diversity and community composition of the 
      rhizosphere fungal and AMF communities of wheat in the CK (not inoculated 
      bacterial agent) and BIO (inoculated with a bacterial agent) groups. Chlorophyll 
      relative content (SPAD), net photosynthesis rate (Pn), transpiration rate (Tr), 
      leaf water use efficiency (WUE (L)), grains per spike and wheat yield in the BIO 
      group increased more than in the CK group. The number of diseased plants and 
      disease incidence was observed to be reduced. The relative efficacy reached 
      79.80%. We classified 1007 fungal operational taxonomic units (OTU) based on 
      Miseq sequencing data: 11 phyla, 173 families, 319 genera, and 521 species. 
      Fifty-four OTUs were classified from the AMF effective sequences, including 1 
      phylum, 3 families, 3 genera, and 17 species. The inoculation of bacterial agents 
      reduced the relative abundance of pathogen genera such as Gibberella, Fusarium, 
      Cladosporium, and Alternaria in wheat rhizosphere. It increased the relative 
      abundance of AMF species such as Glomus-group-B-Glomus-lamellosu-VTX00193, 
      Glomus-viscosum-VTX00063, and Glomus-Glo2-VTX00280. In addition, pH, EC, 
      exchangeable K, available N, total N, organic matter, and olsen P were the main 
      driving forces for shaping wheat rhizosphere fungi. The pH value was positively 
      correlated with the relative abundance of fungal communities in soil, especially 
      Gibberella, Cladosporium, Fusarium, and Alternaria. In summary, inoculation with 
      Bacillus subtilis HG-15 and Bacillus velezensis JC-K3 affected wheat yield, 
      incidence, rhizosphere soil chemical properties, rhizosphere fungi, and AMF 
      fungal diversity and community. The findings may provide a theoretical foundation 
      and strain support for constructing efficient PGPR-community and clarifying its 
      mechanism of pathogenic bacteria inhibition.

TI  - Root exudation of carbon and nitrogen compounds varies over the day-night cycle 
      in pea: The role of diurnal changes in internal pools.
PG  - 962-974
LID - 10.1111/pce.14523 [doi]
AB  - Rhizodeposition is the export of organic compounds from plant roots to the soil. 
      Carbon allocation towards rhizodeposition has to be balanced with allocation for 
      other physiological functions, which depend on both newly assimilated and stored 
      nonstructural carbohydrate (NSC). To test whether the exudation of primary 
      metabolites scales with plant NSC status, we studied diurnal dynamics of NSC and 
      amino acid (AA) pools and fluxes within the plant and the rhizosphere. These 
      diurnal dynamics were measured in the field and under hydroponic-controlled 
      conditions. Further, C-limiting treatments offered further insight into the 
      regulation of rhizodeposition. The exudation of primary metabolites fluctuated 
      diurnally. The diurnal dynamics of soluble sugars (SS) and AA concentrations in 
      tissues coincided with exudate pool fluctuations in the rhizosphere. SS and AA 
      pools in the rhizosphere increased with NSC and AA pools in the roots. C 
      starvation treatments offset the balance of exudates: AA exudate content in the 
      rhizosphere significantly decreased while SS exudate content remained stable. Our 
      results suggest that rhizodeposition is to some extent controlled by plant C:N 
      status. We propose that SS exudation is less controlled than AA exudation because 
      N assimilation depends on controlled C supply while SS exudation relies to a 
      greater extent on passive diffusion mechanisms.

TI  - Impacts of Ecological Shading by Roadside Trees on Tea Foliar Nutritional and

      Plantation.

AB  - Roadside trees not only add aesthetic appeal to tea plantations, but also serve 
      important ecological purposes for the shaded tea plants. In this study, we 
      selected tea orchards with two access roads, from east to west (EW-road) and from 
      south to north (SN-road), and the roadside trees formed three types of ecological 
      shading of the adjoining tea plants; i.e., south shading (SS) by the roadside 
      trees on the EW-road, and east shading and west shading (ES and WS) by the 
      roadside trees on the SN-road. We studied the impacts of ecological shading by 
      roadside trees on the tea plants, insects, and soil microbes in the tea 
      plantation, by measuring the contents of soluble nutrients, bioactive compounds 
      in the tea, and tea quality indices; and by investigating the population 
      occurrence of key species of insects and calculating insect community indexes, 
      while simultaneously assaying the soil microbiome. The results vividly 
      demonstrated that the shading formed by roadside tree lines on the surrounding 
      tea plantation (SS, ES, and WS) had adverse effects on the concentration of tea 
      soluble sugars but enhanced the foliar contents of bioactive components and 
      improved the overall tea quality, in contrast to the no-shading control tea 
      plants. In addition, the roadside tree lines seemed to be beneficial for the tea 
      plantation, as they reduced pest occurrence, and ES shading enhanced the 
      microbial soil diversity in the rhizosphere of the tea plants.

TI  - First Report of Binucleate Rhizoctonia AG-G Causing Root Rot of Japanese Bay Tree 
      (Machilus thunbergii) in Korea.
LID - 10.1094/PDIS-04-22-0982-PDN [doi]
AB  - Machilus thunbergii Sieb. & Zucc., commonly known as Japanese bay tree, is a 
      large evergreen tree belonging to the Lauraceae family and is widely distributed 
      in Asia, including Korea in subtropical and tropical forest areas (Wu et al., 
      2006). In April 2021, a root rot disease of 2-year-old Japanese bay trees was 
      observed in a nursery on Wando Island in Korea. Tree roots exhibited brown to 
      black discoloration, root rot, and deterioration, and leaves were severely wilted 
      followed by plant death, with a disease incidence of approximately 30%. 
      Symptomatic roots were surface sterilized with 1% NaOCl for 5 min and washed 
      three times with distilled water. The root tissues were dried and plated on 
      potato dextrose agar (PDA) and vegetable juice agar (V8) media. After 3-4 days of 
      incubation at 25  C, brown Rhizoctonia fungal-like colonies grew on both culture 
      media. Hyphae of two representative isolates (CMML21-35 and CMML21-36) exhibited 
      typical characteristics of Rhizoctonia, including a constriction of branching 
      hyphae (Alvarez et al., 2013). In addition, two nuclei in each mycelial cell were 
      observed after staining of mycelia with 0.1% Safranin O. The two isolates were 
      identified as binucleate Rhizoctonia based on the microscopic observation. To 
      confirm identification of the isolates, the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) and 
      large subunit (LSU) regions were sequenced using two primer sets, ITS1/ITS4 and 
      LROR/LR5 (White et al., 1990; Vilgalys and Hester 1990). BLASTn search analysis 
      revealed that the ITS sequence of isolates had 99.66% (582 base pair matched of 
      584) sequence similarity with the sequences of binucleate Rhizoctonia (accession 
      numbers JF519837 and AY927327, respectively) and the LSU sequence matched well 
      with the sequence of Rhizoctonia sp. AG-G (accession number MN977413; similarity 
      99.56% and 910 base pair matched of 914). The sequences were deposited in GenBank 
      under accession numbers OM049427 and OM049428 for ITS, OM679289 and OM679290 for 
      LSU. Phylogenetic analysis of ITS and LSU regions revealed that the isolates 
      grouped with binucleate Rhizoctonia anastomosis group AG-G (Teleomorph: 
      Ceratobasidium sp.) with a high bootstrap value. Accordingly, the morphological 
      and molecular characteristics confirmed the causal pathogen as binucleate 
      Rhizoctonia AG-G (Jiang et al., 2016; Gonzalez et al. 2016). To test 
      pathogenicity, a 2-year-old Japanese bay tree was inoculated by creating a hole 
      in the soil near the root rhizosphere and placing 1.5g of ground mycelia obtained 
      from a 5 day-old broth culture at two time points one week apart (Bartz et al., 
      2010). The control pot was inoculated with sterilized ddH(2)O. Inoculated and 
      control plant pots were incubated in plastic boxes with 100% relative humidity at 
      25 ℃ for five days. After that, the pots were placed in the greenhouse at 23-25 
      ℃. One month post inoculation, initial disease symptoms were observed, and after 
      two months, severe foliar wilting and eventual plant death occurred. The 
      non-inoculated control remained healthy. The pathogen was re-isolated from 
      infected roots, fulfilling Koch's postulates. The experiment was conducted three 
      times with three replications. This is the first report of root rot of Japanese 
      bay tree caused by binucleate Rhizoctonia AG-G in Korea and in the world. 
      Previously, a pathogenic binucleate Rhizoctonia AG-G was isolated from colonized 
      apple tree roots in orchards in Italy (Kelderer et al., 2012). The present study 
      implies that this pathogen potentially causes a negative impact on the nursery 
      and forest industries, thus further research on the screening for pathogenicity 
      in other tropical and subtropical trees and also apple, which is an important 
      crop in Korea, is needed.

TI  - The effect of root hairs on exudate composition: a comparative non-targeted 
      metabolomics approach.
PG  - 823-840
LID - 10.1007/s00216-022-04475-9 [doi]
AB  - Root exudation is a major pathway of organic carbon input into soils. It affects 
      soil physical properties, element solubility as well as speciation, and impacts 
      the microbial community in the rhizosphere. Root exudates contain a large number 
      of primary and secondary plant metabolites, and the amount and composition are 
      highly variable depending on plant species and developmental stage. Detailed 
      information about exudate composition will allow for a better understanding of 
      exudate-driven rhizosphere processes and their feedback loops. Although 
      non-targeted metabolomics by high-resolution mass spectrometry is an established 
      tool to characterize root exudate composition, the extent and depth of the 
      information obtained depends strongly on the analytical approach applied. Here, 
      two genotypes of Zea mays L., differing in root hair development, were used to 
      compare six mass spectrometric approaches for the analysis of root exudates. 
      Reversed-phase liquid chromatography and hydrophilic interaction liquid 
      chromatography combined with time-of-flight mass spectrometry (LC-TOF-MS), as 
      well as direct infusion Fourier-transform ion cyclotron resonance mass 
      spectrometry (DI-FT-ICR-MS), were applied with positive and negative ionization 
      mode. By using the same statistical workflow, the six approaches resulted in 
      different numbers of detected molecular features, ranging from 176 to 889, with a 
      fraction of 48 to 69% of significant features (fold change between the two 
      genotypes of > 2 and p-value < 0.05). All approaches revealed the same trend 
      between genotypes, namely up-regulation of most metabolites in the root hair 
      defective mutant (rth3). These results were in agreement with the higher total 
      carbon and nitrogen exudation rate of the rth3-mutant as compared to the 
      corresponding wild-type maize (WT). However, only a small fraction of features 
      were commonly found across the different analytical approaches (20-79 features, 
      13-31% of the rth3-mutant up-regulated molecular formulas), highlighting the need 
      for different mass spectrometric approaches to obtain a more comprehensive view 
      into the composition of root exudates. In summary, 111 rth3-mutant up-regulated 
      compounds (92 different molecular formulas) were detected with at least two 
      different analytical approaches, while no WT up-regulated compound was found by 
      both, LC-TOF-MS and DI-FT-ICR-MS. Zea mays L. exudate features obtained with 
      multiple analytical approaches in our study were matched against the metabolome 
      database of Zea mays L. (KEGG) and revealed 49 putative metabolites based on 
      their molecular formula.

AB  - In forests, mycorrhizal fungi regulate carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) dynamics. We 
      evaluated the interplay among ectomycorrhizas (ECM), ecosystem C fluxes, tree 
      productivity, C and N exchange and isotopic fractionation along the 
      soil-ECM-plant continuum in a Mediterranean beech forest. From bud break to leaf 
      shedding, we monitored: net ecosystem exchange (NEE, a measure of the net 
      exchange of C between an ecosystem and the atmosphere), leaf area index, stem 
      growth, N concentration, delta(13) C and delta(15) N in rhizosphere soil, ectomycorrhizal 
      fine root tips (ERT), ECM-free fine root portions (NCR) and leaves. Seasonal 
      changes in ERT relative biomass were strictly related to NEE and mimicked those 
      detected in the radial growth. The analysis of delta(13) C in ERT, leaves and NCR 
      highlighted the impact of canopy photosynthesis on ERT development and an 
      asynchronous seasonal C allocation strategy between ERT and NCR at the root tips 
      level. Concerning N, delta(15) N of leaves was negatively related to that of ERT and 
      dependent on seasonal (15) N differences between ERT and NCR. Our results unravel 
      a synchronous C allocation towards ERT and tree stem driven by the increasing NEE 
      in spring-early summer. Moreover, they highlighted a phenology-dependent (15) N 
      fractionation during N transfer from ECM to their hosts. This evidence, obtained 
      in mature beech trees under natural conditions, may improve the knowledge of 
      Mediterranean forests functionality.

AB  - Compared with the ordinary single-season shooting among woody bamboos in Poaceae, 
      the attribute of full-year shooting in Cephalostachyum pingbianense represents a 
      unique shooting type or mechanism. Nevertheless, except for the overall 
      physiological mechanism, the effect of ecological factors, especially soil 
      microorganisms, on this full-year shooting characteristic remains unclear. In 
      this study, 16S rRNA and ITS rRNA genes were sequenced using the Illumina 
      platform. Our aims were to detect the seasonal changes in rhizospheric microbial 
      communities of C. pingbianense and to discover the correlations of soil microbes 
      with soil properties and bamboo shoot productivity. The results showed that 
      seasonal change had no significant effect on bacterial alpha diversity, but 
      significantly affected bacterial and fungal community structures as well as 
      fungal richness. Among all soil properties examined, soil temperature, soil 
      moisture and organic matter were the predominant factors affecting bacterial 
      community diversity and structure. Soil temperature and soil moisture also 
      significantly influenced fungal community structure, while available phosphorus 
      had the greatest effect on fungal diversity. In each season, bacterial genera 
      Acidothermus, Roseiarcus, and Bradyrhizobium, along with fungal genera Saitozyma, 
      Mortierella, Trichoderma, etc., were dominant in bacterial and fungal 
      communities, respectively. Bacterial community functions in four seasons were 
      dominated by chemoheterotrophy, cellulolysis, and nitrogen fixation. Saprotrophic 
      fungi occupied a high proportion in soil samples of all seasons. In addition, 
      correlation analysis revealed that the bamboo shoot productivity was positively 
      correlated with multiple microbial taxa involved in carbon and nitrogen cycles. 
      It is proposed that highly abundant microbes involved in carbohydrate degradation 
      and nitrogen fixation in the rhizosphere soil may contribute to the attribute of 
      producing bamboo shoots all year round in C. pingbianense. This study is among 
      the few cases revealing the connection between bamboo shooting characteristics 
      and soil microorganisms, and provides new physiological and ecological insights 
      into the forest management of woody bamboos.

AB  - The interaction between plants and microbes dominates plant growth and fitness in 
      specific environments. The study of the relationship between plant genotypes and 
      rhizobacterial community structure would provide a deep insight into the 
      recruitment strategies of plants toward soil bacteria. In this study, three 
      genotypes of 18-year-old mature poplar (H1, H2, and H3) derived from four 
      different parents were selected from a germplasm nursery of Populus deltoides. 
      Rhizosphere soil carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus properties as well as the 16S 
      rDNA sequences of rhizobacterial communities were analyzed to determine the 
      relationship between poplar genotypes and rhizobacterial communities assembly. 
      The results showed there were significant differences in the diversity (Chao1, 
      ACE index, and Shannon index) of rhizobacterial communities between H1 and H2, as 
      well as between H2 and H3, but no difference between H1 and H3. Principal 
      component analysis also revealed a similar structure of rhizobacterial 
      communities between H1 and H3, whereas the rhizobacterial communities of H2 
      demonstrated significant differences from H1 and H3. Linear discriminant effect 
      size analysis indicated that there were 11 and 14 different biomarkers in the H1 
      and H3 genotype, respectively, but 42 in the H2 genotype. Co-occurrence network 
      analysis indicated that the rhizobacterial communities of H2 had a distinct 
      network structure compared to those of the other two genotypes, whereas H1 and H3 
      had a similar pattern of co-occurrence network. Threshold indicator taxa analysis 
      revealed that 63 genera responded significantly to NO(3) (-)-N content and 58 
      genera to NH(4) (+)-N/NO(3) (-)-N ratio. Moreover, the stochastic assembly 
      process was found to be decreased with increasing NO(3) (-)-N content and 
      fluctuated with increasing NH(4) (+)-N/NO(3) (-)-N ratio. All results indicated 
      that the structure of poplar rhizobacterial communities were influenced by host 
      genotypes, and available nitrogen might play a dominant role in the assembly of 
      rhizobacterial communities. This study would promote the future selection and 
      utilization of rhizobacteria in poplar breeding.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Ralstonia solanacearum (Rs) is a soilborne phytopathogen that causes 
      bacterial wilt and substantial yield losses in many plants, such as tomatoes. A 
      resistant tomato cultivar can recruit a beneficial microbiome from soil to resist 
      Rs. However, whether this recruitment is inheritable from resistant parent to 
      progeny has not been determined. RESULTS: In the present study, we investigated 
      the rhizosphere microbiomes of tomatoes with clear kinship and different 
      resistance against Rs. Resistant tomatoes grown with the additions of natural 
      soil or its extract showed lower disease indexes than those grown in the sterile 
      soil, demonstrating the importance of soil microbiome in resisting Rs. The 
      results of 16S ribosomal RNA gene amplicon sequencing revealed that the resistant 
      cultivars had more robust rhizosphere microbiomes than the susceptible ones. 
      Besides, the resistant progeny HF12 resembled its resistant parent HG64 in the 
      rhizosphere microbiome. The rhizosphere microbiome had functional consistency 
      between HF12 and HG64 as revealed by metagenomics. Based on multi-omics analysis 
      and experimental validation, two rhizobacteria (Sphingomonas sp. Cra20 and 
      Pseudomonas putida KT2440) were enriched in HF12 and HG64 with the ability to 
      offer susceptible tomatoes considerable protection against Rs. Multiple aspects 
      were involved in the protection, including reducing the virulence-related genes 
      of Rs and reshaping the transcriptomes of the susceptible tomatoes. CONCLUSIONS: 
      We found promising bacteria to suppress the tomato bacterial wilt in sustainable 
      agriculture. And our research provides insights into the heritability of 
      Rs-resistant tomato rhizobacteria, echoing the inheritance of tomato genetic 
      material. Video Abstract.

LID - 5131
AB  - The article summarizes multivariate field trials of gel-forming soil conditioners 
      for agriculture and urban landscaping in various climatic conditions from arid 
      (O.A.E., Uzbekistan) to humid (Moscow region, Russia). The field test program 
      included environmental monitoring of weather data, temperature, water-air 
      regimes, salinity, alkalinity, and biological activity of various soils (sandy 
      and loamy sandy Arenosols, Retisols, loamy Serozems), productivity and yield of 
      plants (lawns, vegetables) and their quality, including pathogen infestation. The 
      evolutionary line of polymer superabsorbents from radiation-crosslinked 
      polyacrylamide (1995) to the patented "Aquapastus" material (2014-2020) with 
      amphiphilic fillers and biocidal additives demonstrated not only success, but 
      also the main problems of using hydrogels in soils (biodegradation, osmotic 
      collapse, etc.), as well as their technological solutions. Along with innovative 
      materials, our know-how consisted in the intelligent soil design of capillary 
      barriers for water accumulation and antipathogenic and antielectrolyte protection 
      of the rhizosphere. Gel-forming polymer conditioners and new technologies of 
      their application increase the productivity of plant crops and the quality of 
      biomass by 30-50%, with a 1.3-2-fold saving of water resources and reliable 
      protection of the topsoil from pathogens and secondary salinization. The results 
      can be useful to a wide range of specialists from chemical technologists to 
      agronomists and landscapers.

AB  - An introduction of exotic or non-native trees may fail due to a lack of suitable 
      fungal partners. We planted exotic Pinus radiata in Xifeng, Guizhou Southwest 
      China. Strategies to introduce P. radiata seedlings either colonized with an 
      ectomycorrhizal fungus (EcMF), Lactarius deliciosus, or expect them to form 
      familiar/new associations with local EcMF in a new habitat were studied to know 
      how P. radiata could be successfully established over a period of 2.5 years. 
      Plant height and needle nutrient acquisition, the persistence of the 
      co-introduced L. deliciosus, and fungal community composition in rhizosphere soil 
      and root tips were analyzed. In addition, a greenhouse bioassay experiment of 
      local soil to assess the differences in the EcMF community between exotic and 
      native pine seedlings was also conducted. The current results demonstrated that 
      P. radiata could establish in the Xifeng plantation with or without co-introduced 
      L. deliciosus. The co-introduced L. deliciosus might be naturalized with P. 
      radiata in the new area since it has been fruited for 2 years with high relative 
      abundance in mycorrhizosphere soil. L. deliciosus pre-colonization significantly 
      altered the mycorrhizosphere fungal composition and it had a positive correlation 
      with nitrogen acquisition of P. radiata. Host identity had no effect on fungal 
      composition since exotic P. radiata and native P. massoniana recruited similar 
      local fungal communities in early establishment or in plantation. The 
      cosmopolitan species Suillus placidus, with high relative abundance, formed a 
      familiar association with P. radiata. The greenhouse bioassay experiment further 
      showed that Suillus sp. contributed relatively higher total extracellular enzymes 
      by forming ectomycorrhizas with P. radiata and the same type of ectomycorrhiza of 
      P. radiata and P. massoniana showed different enzymatic functions. Our study 
      indicated that exotic P. radiata could be a suitable tree capable to get 
      established successfully in the Xifeng plantation either by interaction with the 
      co-introduced L. deliciosus or with a local EcMF, but we should be cautious about 
      large-scale planting of P. radiata. L. deliciosus persisted in plantation and 
      more attention should be paid to local EcMF community changes induced by the 
      introduced L. deliciosus.

AB  - Recent policies and silvicultural management call for forest regeneration that 
      involve the selection of tree species able to cope with low soil nutrient 
      availability in forest ecosystems. Understanding the impact of different tree 
      species on the rhizosphere processes (e.g., enzyme activities) involved in 
      nutrient mobilisation is critical in selecting suitable species to adapt forests 
      to environmental change. Here, we visualised and investigated the rhizosphere 
      distribution of enzyme activities (cellobiohydrolase, leucine-aminopeptidase, and 
      acid phosphomonoesterase) using zymography. We related the distribution of enzyme 
      activities to the seedling root morphological traits of European beech (Fagus 
      sylvatica) and Norway spruce (Picea abies), the two most cultivated temperate 
      tree species that employ contrasting strategies in soil nutrient acquisition. We 
      found that spruce showed a higher morphological heterogeneity along the roots 
      than beech, resulting in a more robust relationship between rhizoplane-associated 
      enzyme activities and the longitudinal distance from the root apex. The 
      rhizoplane enzyme activities decreased in spruce and increased in beech with the 
      distance from the root apex over a power-law equation. Spruce revealed broader 
      rhizosphere extents of all three enzymes, but only acid phosphomonoesterase 
      activity was higher compared with beech. This latter result was determined by a 
      larger root system found in beech compared with spruce that enhanced 
      cellobiohydrolase and leucine-aminopeptidase activities. The root hair zone and 
      hair lengths were significant variables determining the distribution of enzyme 
      activities in the rhizosphere. Our findings indicate that spruce has a more 
      substantial influence on rhizosphere enzyme production and diffusion than beech, 
      enabling spruce to better mobilise nutrients from organic sources in 
      heterogeneous forest soils.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Acute Oak Decline (AOD) is a decline disease first reported on native 
      oaks in the UK, but in recent years reports from further afield such as Europe 
      and the Middle East, indicate that the distribution and host range is increasing 
      at an alarming rate. The stem weeping symptoms of the disease partially develop 
      due to polymicrobial-host interaction, caused by several members of the order 
      Enterobacterales. While investigating the rhizosphere soil of AOD-unaffected 
      trees, termed 'healthy' trees, and diseased oaks suffering from Acute Oak Decline 
      (AOD), an enrichment method designed for enhanced recovery of Enterobacterales 
      led to the recovery of several isolates that could not be classified as any 
      existing species. These isolates showed a close relationship to the genus 
      Leclercia, of which both species are of clinical importance, but the type species 
      Leclercia adecarboxylata also displays plant growth-promoting properties in the 
      rhizosphere. RESULTS: Partial sequencing of four housekeeping genes revealed 
      similarity to the genus Leclercia with varying degrees of relatedness. As such a 
      complete polyphasic approach was used to determine the true taxonomic position of 
      these isolates. This involved whole genome sequencing, phylogenomic analysis, 
      phylogenetic analysis of both the 16S rRNA and four housekeeping gene sequences, 
      combined with phenotypic testing and fatty acid analysis. Both the phylogenomic 
      and phylogenetic analyses separated the isolates into four clusters, two of which 
      were contained in the Leclercia clade. The remaining two clusters formed a 
      separate lineage far removed from any currently defined species. Further 
      investigation into the role of the isolates as plant growth-promoting bacteria as 
      well as plant pathogens was investigated computationally, revealing a number of 
      plant growth-promoting traits as well as virulence genes related to motility, 
      adhesion and immune modulation. CONCLUSION: Based on the genotypic and phenotypic 
      data presented here, these isolates could be differentiated from each other and 
      their closest neighbours. As such we propose the description of Leclercia tamurae 
      sp. nov. (type strain H6S3(T) = LMG 32609(T) = CCUG 76176(T)), Silvania gen. 
      nov., Silvania hatchlandensis sp. nov. (type strain H19S6(T) = LMG 
      32608(T) = CCUG 76185(T)) and Silvania confinis sp. nov. (type strain 
      H4N4(T) = LMG 32607(T) = CCUG 76175(T)). Due to their interesting protein 
      annotations and alignments, these species warrant further investigation for their 
      role in relation to plant health.

AB  - Land-use conversion affects the composition and assembly of plant-associated 
      microbiomes, which in turn affects plant growth, development, and ecosystem 
      functioning. However, agroforestry systems, as sustainable land types, have 
      received little attention regarding the dynamics of different plant-associated 
      microbes. In this study, we used high-throughput sequencing technology to analyze 
      the assembly mechanisms and the driving factors of pine- and Panax notoginseng 
      (P.n.)-associated microbiomes during the conversion of different pine forests 
      (Pinus kesiya var. langbianensis and Pinus armandii) into P.n.-pine agroforestry 
      systems. The results showed that the conversion of pure pine forest into 
      P.n.-pine agroforestry systems significantly altered the diversity of 
      pine-associated fungi rather than the community structure, and the community 
      structure of P.n.-associated fungi rather than the diversity. Additionally, 
      plant-associated fungi were more responsive to land-use change than bacteria. 
      Main effect analysis revealed that compartment rather than genotype was the 
      driving factor of pine- and P.n.-associated microbiomes, but P.n. cultivation 
      also significantly affected the assembly of pine-associated microbiomes. In 
      addition, there was a transfer of P.n. endophytes to pine trees in agroforestry 
      systems and the beneficial microbiomes (Massilia, Marmoricola, Herbaspirillum, 
      etc.) were enlarged in pine roots. Therefore, the diversity of the assembly 
      mechanisms of P.n.- and pine-associated microbiomes played an important role in 
      the P.n.--pine agroforestry systems and were the basis for the sustainable 
      development of the P.n.--pine agroforestry systems.

AB  - Siderophore-positive bacteria present in the rhizosphere and in bulk soil assist 
      plants by either inhibiting phytopathogen proliferation or increasing plant 
      growth. The bacterial diversity of the Shisham forest ecosystem in the Tarai 
      region of the Western Himalayas was studied and used for siderophore production, 
      taking into account the large-scale dieback and wilt-induced mortality in 
      Dalbergia sissoo (common name: shisham) plantation forests and the importance of 
      soil microbes in tree health. In addition, Pseudomonas, Burkholderia, and 
      Streptomyces were prominent siderophore-positive bacteria in Shisham forests. 
      Pseudomonas species are known for their remarkable siderophore-producing ability. 
      Bacterial siderophores inhibit pathogen growth by rapidly lowering the number of 
      ferric ions in the rhizosphere. The Pseudomonas monteilii strain MN759447 was 
      isolated from a D. sissoo plantation forest at the Agroforestry Research Centre, 
      Pantnagar, Uttarakhand (28 degrees 58'N 79 degrees 25'E/28.97 degrees N 79.41 degrees E). It produces a 
      significant number of siderophore units (80.36% in total). A two-stage 
      optimization of growth factors was attempted in the strain MN759447 for better 
      siderophore recovery. In the first-stage single-factor experiment, among the five 
      variables studied, only pH, NH(4)NO(3) concentration, and Fe concentration 
      affected siderophore synthesis. In the second stage, an optimization of pH, 
      NH(4)NO(3) concentration, and Fe concentration for improved growth and enhanced 
      siderophore production was carried out using a Box-Behnken design with response 
      surface methodology. By using LC-MS, two derivatives of pseudomonine, salicylic 
      acid, and kynurenic acid were detected as siderophores in the purified XAD-2 
      methanol extract of the P. monteilii strain MN759447. In addition to siderophore 
      production, the P. monteilii strain MN759447 also exhibited a broad range of 
      antagonistic activity against Aspergillus calidoustus (65%), Fusarium oxysporum 
      (41.66%), Talaromyces pinophilus (65%), and Talaromyces verruculosus (65.1%) that 
      are linked to sissoo mortality. To our knowledge, this is the first report on 
      siderophore-producing bacteria isolated, identified, and characterized from the 
      D. sissoo Roxb. forest habitat. This strain can also be developed as a commercial 
      product.

TI  - Hidden Tenants: Microbiota of the Rhizosphere and Phyllosphere of Cordia 
      dodecandra Trees in Mayan Forests and Homegardens.
LID - 10.3390/plants11223098 [doi]
LID - 3098
AB  - During domestication, the selection of cultivated plants often reduces microbiota 
      diversity compared with their wild ancestors. Microbiota in compartments such as 
      the phyllosphere or rhizosphere can promote fruit tree health, growth, and 
      development. Cordia dodecandra is a deciduous tree used by Maya people for its 
      fruit and wood, growing, to date, in remnant forest fragments and homegardens 
      (traditional agroforestry systems) in Yucatan. In this work, we evaluated the 
      microbiota's alpha and beta diversity per compartment (phyllosphere and 
      rhizosphere) and per population (forest and homegarden) in the Northeast and 
      Southwest Yucatan regions. Eight composite DNA samples (per 
      compartment/population/region combination) were amplified for 16S-RNA (bacteria) 
      and ITS1-2 (fungi) and sequenced by Illumina MiSeq. Bioinformatic analyses were 
      performed with QIIME and phyloseq. For bacteria and fungi, from 107,947 and 
      128,786 assembled sequences, 618 and 1092 operating taxonomic units (OTUs) were 
      assigned, respectively. The alpha diversity of bacteria and fungi was highly 
      variable among samples and was similar among compartments and populations. A 
      significant species turnover among populations and regions was observed in the 
      rhizosphere. The core microbiota from the phyllosphere was similar among 
      populations and regions. Forests and homegarden populations are reservoirs of the 
      C. dodecandra phyllosphere core microbiome and significant rhizosphere 
      biodiversity.

TI  - Variation in Community Structure of the Root-Associated Fungi of Cinnamomum 
      camphora Forest.
LID - 10.3390/jof8111210 [doi]
LID - 1210
AB  - Plant-associated microbial communities play essential roles in the vegetative 
      cycle, growth, and development of plants. Cinnamomum camphora is an evergreen 
      tree species of the Lauraceae family with high ornamental, medicinal, and 
      economic values. The present study analyzed the composition, diversity, and 
      functions of the fungal communities in the bulk soil, rhizosphere, and root 
      endosphere of C. camphora at different slope positions by high-throughput 
      sequencing. The results showed that the alpha diversity of the fungal communities 
      in the bulk soil and rhizosphere of the downhill plots was relatively higher than 
      those uphill. A further analysis revealed that Mucoromycota, the dominant fungus 
      at the phylum level, was positively correlated with soil bulk density, total soil 
      porosity, mass water content, alkaline-hydrolyzable nitrogen, maximum field 
      capacity, and least field capacity. Meanwhile, the prevalent fungus at the class 
      level, Mortierellomycetes, was positively correlated with total phosphorus and 
      available and total potassium, but negatively with alkaline-hydrolyzable 
      nitrogen. Finally, the assignment of the functional guilds to the fungal 
      operational taxonomic units (OTUs) revealed that the OTUs highly enriched in the 
      downhill samples compared with the uphill samples, which were saprotrophs. Thus, 
      this study is the first to report differences in the fungal community among the 
      different soil/root samples and between C. camphora forests grown at different 
      slope positions. We also identified the factors favoring the root-associated 
      beneficial fungi in these forests, providing theoretical guidance for managing C. 
      camphora forests.

AB  - Mycorrhizal fungi boost host plant growth by improving roots' ability to absorb 
      nutrients and water from the rhizosphere soil. In this study, a mass inoculum of 
      the ectomycorrhizal fungus Scleroderma polyrhizum was produced on wheat grains 
      and incorporated into polybags during seed sowing of Pinus gerardiana, with the 
      expectation that the roots of the germinating seedlings would form a mycorrhizal 
      association with S. polyrhizum. For 2 years, the seedlings' growth parameters 
      were measured at 3-month intervals. The seedlings raised in inoculated bags 
      exhibited ectomycorrhizal anatomy and higher growth indices like absolute growth 
      rate, relative growth rate, sturdiness quotient, volume index, quality index etc. 
      The growth parameters of 2-year-old inoculated seedlings were 44.36 to 94.36 
      percent higher than control. Shoot dry weight increased the most (94.36 percent), 
      followed by root volume (93.59 percent), shoot fresh weight (91.42 percent), root 
      fresh weight (79.46 percent), and collar diameter increased the least (49.30 
      percent). Two-year-old seedlings were outplanted in two locations: one within and 
      one beyond its normal zone of occurrence. Inoculated seedlings fared better at 
      both sites in terms of survival and growth. S. polyrhizum inoculation has 
      accelerated the growth metrics of P. gerardiana seedlings. Thus, it can be 
      recommended that the P. gerardiana nursery should be raised by artificial 
      inoculation with S. polyrhizum to produce healthy, tall planting stock in a 
      shorter nursery time while also lowering maintenance costs.

LID - 18
AB  - Advances in next-generation sequencing technologies have accelerated the momentum 
      of metagenomic studies, which is increasing yearly. The metagenomics field is one 
      of the versatile applications in microbiology, where any interaction in the 
      environment involving microorganisms can be the topic of study. Due to this 
      versatility, the number of applications of this omics technology reached its 
      horizons. Agriculture is a crucial sector involving crop plants and 
      microorganisms interacting together. Hence, studying these interactions through 
      the lenses of metagenomics would completely disclose a new meaning to crop health 
      and development. The rhizosphere is an essential reservoir of the microbial 
      community for agricultural soil. Hence, we focus on the R&D of metagenomic 
      studies on the rhizosphere of crops such as rice, wheat, legumes, chickpea, and 
      sorghum. These recent developments are impossible without the continuous 
      advancement seen in the next-generation sequencing platforms; thus, a brief 
      introduction and analysis of the available sequencing platforms are presented 
      here to have a clear picture of the workflow. Concluding the topic is the 
      discussion about different pipelines applied to analyze data produced by 
      sequencing techniques and have a significant role in interpreting the outcome of 
      a particular experiment. A plethora of different software and tools are 
      incorporated in the automated pipelines or individually available to perform 
      manual metagenomic analysis. Here we describe 8-10 advanced, efficient pipelines 
      used for analysis that explain their respective workflows to simplify the whole 
      analysis process.

TI  - Mycorrhizal diversity and community composition in co-occurring Cypripedium 
      species.
PG  - 107-118
LID - 10.1007/s00572-022-01095-0 [doi]
AB  - Orchids commonly rely on mycorrhizal fungi to obtain the necessary resources for 
      seed germination and growth. Whereas most photosynthetic orchids typically 
      associate with so-called rhizoctonia fungi to complete their life cycle, there is 
      increasing evidence that other fungi may be involved as well and that the 
      mycorrhizal communities associated with orchids may be more diverse. Coexisting 
      orchid species also tend to associate with different fungi to reduce competition 
      for similar resources and to increase long-term population viability. However, 
      few studies have related the mycorrhizal communities in the rhizosphere to 
      communities found in the roots of closely related coexisting orchid species. In 
      this study, we used high-throughput sequencing to investigate the diversity and 
      community composition of orchid mycorrhizal fungi in the roots and the 
      rhizosphere of four Cypripedium species growing in forests in Northeast China. 
      The results showed that the investigated Cypripedium species associated with a 
      wide variety of fungi including members of Tulasnellaceae, Psathyrellaceae, and 
      Herpotrichiellaceae, whereas members of Russulaceae, Cortinariaceae, 
      Thelephoraceae, and Herpotrichiellaceae showed high abundance in rhizosphere 
      soils. The diversity of fungi detected in the rhizosphere soil was much higher 
      than that in the roots. The observed variation in fungal communities in 
      Cypripedium roots was not related to forest site or orchid species. On the other 
      hand, variation in mycorrhizal communities of rhizosphere soil was significantly 
      related to sampling site. These results indicate that orchid mycorrhizal 
      communities in the rhizosphere display considerable variation among sites and 
      that orchids use only a subset of the locally available fungi. Future studies 
      focusing on the fine-scale spatial distribution of orchid mycorrhizal fungi and 
      more detailed assessments of local environmental conditions will provide novel 
      insights into the mechanisms explaining variation of fungal communities in both 
      orchid roots and the rhizosphere.

TI  - Effects of potential allelochemicals in a water extract of Abutilon theophrasti 
      Medik. on germination and growth of Glycine max L., Triticum aestivum L., and Zea 
      mays L.
PG  - 2155-2165

AB  - BACKGROUND: Velvetleaf (Abutilon theophrasti Medik.), primarily a cropland weed, 
      exerts adverse impacts on the productivity of various crops, including soybean 
      (Glycine max L.), wheat (Triticum aestivum L.), and maize (Zea mays L.), by 
      hindering their vegetative growth. However, the interference mechanism of 
      velvetleaf on the three crops remains unclear. RESULTS: The inhibitory effect of 
      velvetleaf water extract on the germination and growth of soybean, wheat, and 
      maize was determined in pot experiments and field trials. Four phenolic acids 
      were identified as allelochemicals: protocatechuic acid (PA), gallic acid (GA), 
      chlorogenic acid (CHA), and vanillic acid (VA). These allelochemicals were 
      detected in different parts (leaves, roots, and stems) of velvetleaf, and in the 
      rhizosphere soil of tested crops over the range of 1.19-556.23 mum kg(-1) . These 
      allelochemicals were administered in approximate concentrations as in velvetleaf 
      roots and rhizosphere soil, and their effects varied with crop species and 
      velvetleaf parts. The allelochemicals generally had low-dose stimulation and 
      high-dose inhibition effects on the growth of soybean, wheat, and maize. 
      Furthermore, the biomass distribution of these crops was affected by 
      allelochemicals in the soil. In field trials, the allelochemicals significantly 
      (P < 0.05) inhibited the growth of all tested crops over the whole growth period, 
      and PA showed a significant (P < 0.05) inhibitory effect on the yield of soybean, 
      wheat, and maize. CONCLUSION: GA, PA, CHA, and VA in velvetleaf aqueous extracts 
      were identified as allelochemicals that play an inhibitory role on three crops. (c)

TI  - Diversity and Taxonomy of Soil Bacterial Communities in Urban and Rural Mangrove 
      Forests of the Panama Bay.
LID - 10.3390/microorganisms10112191 [doi]
LID - 2191
AB  - Mangrove ecosystems are threatened worldwide by a wide range of factors including 
      climate change, coastal development, and pollution. The effects of these factors 
      on soil bacterial communities of Neotropical mangroves and their temporal 
      dynamics is largely undocumented. Here we compared the diversity and taxonomic 
      composition of bacterial communities in the soil of two mangrove forest sites of 
      the Panama Bay: Juan Diaz (JD), an urban mangrove forest in Panama City 
      surrounded by urban development, with occurrence of five mangrove species, and 
      polluted with solid waste and sewage; and Bayano (B), a rural mangrove forest 
      without urban development, without solid waste pollution, and with the presence 
      of two mangrove species. Massive amplicon sequencing of the V4 region of the 16S 
      rRNA gene and community analyses were implemented. In total, 20,691 bacterial 
      amplicon sequence variants were identified, and the bacterial community was more 
      diverse in the rural mangrove forest based on Faith's phylogenetic diversity 
      index. The three dominant phyla of bacteria found and shared between the two 
      sites were Proteobacteria, Desulfobacterota, and Chloroflexi. The ammonia 
      oxidizing archaea class Nitrosphaeria was found among the top 10 most abundant. 
      Dominant genera of bacteria that occurred in the two mangrove sites were: 
      BD2-11_terrestrial_group (Gemmatimonadota), EPR3968-O8a-Bc78 
      (Gammaproteobacteria), Salinimicrobium (Bacteroidetes), Sulfurovum 
      (Campylobacteria), and Woeseia (Gammaproteobacteria) of which the first three and 
      Methyloceanibacter had increased in relative abundance in the transition from 
      rainy to dry to rainy season in the urban mangrove forest. Altogether, our study 
      suggests that factors such as urban development, vegetation composition, 
      pollution, and seasonal changes may cause shifts in bacterial diversity and 
      relative abundance of specific taxa in mangrove soils. In particular, taxa with 
      roles in biogeochemical cycles of carbon, nitrogen, sulfur, and phosphorus, and 
      on rhizosphere taxa, could be important for mangrove plant resilience to 
      environmental stress.

TI  - Agricultural Crops Grown in Laboratory Conditions on Chernevaya Taiga Soil 
      Demonstrate Unique Composition of the Rhizosphere Microbiota.
LID - 10.3390/microorganisms10112171 [doi]
LID - 2171
AB  - Chernevaya taiga in West Siberia is a unique environment, with gigantism of 
      grasses and shrubs. Exceptionally high productivity of plants is determined by 
      the synergistic interaction of various factors, with a special role belonging to 
      microorganisms colonizing the plant roots. This research explored whether 
      agricultural plants can recruit specific microorganisms from within virgin 
      Chernevaya Umbrisol and thus increase their productivity. Radish and wheat plants 
      were grown on the Umbrisol (T1) and control Retisol of Scotch pine forest stand 
      (T3) soils in the phytotron, and then a bacterial community analysis of the 
      rhizosphere was performed using high-throughput sequencing of the 16S rRNA genes. 
      In laboratory experiments, the plant physiological parameters were significantly 
      higher when growing on the Umbrisol as compared to the Retisol. Bacterial 
      diversity in T1 soil was considerably higher than in the control sample, and the 
      principal coordinate analysis demonstrated apparent differences in the bacterial 
      communities associated with the plants. Agricultural plants growing in the T1 
      soil form specific prokaryotic communities, with dominant genera Chthoniobacter, 
      Pseudomonas, Burkholderia, and Massilia. These communities also include less 
      abundant but essential for plant growth nitrifiers Cand. Nitrosocosmius and 
      Nitrospira, and representatives of Proteobacteria, Bacilli, and Actinobacteria, 
      known to be gibberellin-producers.

TI  - Isolation and identification of plant growth-promoting rhizobacteria from tall 
      fescue rhizosphere and their functions under salt stress.
PG  - e13817

AB  - Soil salinity has become one of the major factors that threaten tall fescue 
      growth and turf quality. Plants recruit diverse microorganisms in the rhizosphere 
      to cope with salinity stress. In this study, 15 plant growth-promoting 
      rhizobacteria (PGPR) were isolated from the salt-treated rhizosphere of tall 
      fescue and were annotated to 10 genera, including Agrobacterium, Fictibacillus, 
      Rhizobium, Bhargavaea, Microbacterium, Paenarthrobacter, Pseudarthrobacter, 
      Bacillus, Halomonas, and Paracoccus. All strains could produce indole-3-acetic 
      acid (IAA). Additionally, eight strains exhibited the ability to solubilize 
      phosphate and potassium. Most strains could grow on the medium containing 600 mM 
      NaCl, such as Bacillus zanthoxyli and Bacillus altitudinis. Furthermore, Bacillus 
      zanthoxyli and Bacillus altitudinis were inoculated with tall fescue seeds and 
      seedlings to determine their growth-promoting effect. The results showed that 
      Bacillus altitudinis and mixed culture significantly increased the germination 
      rate of tall fescue seeds. Bacillus zanthoxyli can significantly increase the 
      tillers number and leaf width of seedlings under salt conditions. Through the 
      synergistic effect of FaSOS1, FaHKT1, and FaHAK1 genes, Bacillus zanthoxyli helps 
      to expel the excess Na(+) from aboveground parts and absorb more K(+) in roots to 
      maintain ion homeostasis in tall fescue. Unexpectedly, we found that Bacillus 
      altitudinis displayed an inapparent growth-promoting effect on seedlings under 
      salt stress. Interestingly, the mixed culture of the two strains was also able to 
      alleviate, to some extent, the effects of salt stress on tall fescue. This study 
      provides a preliminary understanding of tall fescue rhizobacteria and highlights 
      the role of Bacillus zanthoxyli in tall fescue growth and salt tolerance.

AB  - Nitrogen (N) availability is significant in different ecosystems, but the 
      response of forest plant-microbial symbionts to global N deposition remains 
      largely unexplored. In this study, the effects of different N concentration 
      levels on four types of fungi, Suillus granulatus (Sg), Pisolithus tinctorius 
      (Pt), Pleotrichocladium opacum (Po), and Pseudopyrenochaeta sp. (Ps), isolated 
      from the roots of Pinus tabulaeformis were investigated in vitro. Then, the 
      effects of the fungi on the growth performance, nutrient uptake, and rhizosphere 
      soil microbial community structure of P. tabulaeformis under different N addition 
      conditions (0, 40, and 80 kg hm(-2) year(-1)) were examined. The biomass and 
      phytohormone contents of the Sg, Pt and Po strains increased with increasing N 
      concentration, while those of the Ps strain first increased and then decreased. 
      All four fungal strains could effectively colonize the plant roots and form a 
      strain-dependent symbiosis with P. tabulaeformis. Although the effects depended 
      on the fungal species, the growth and root development of inoculated seedlings 
      were higher than those of uninoculated seedlings under N deficiency and normal N 
      supply conditions. However, these positive effects disappeared and even became 
      negative under high N supply conditions. The inoculation of the four fungal 
      strains also showed significant positive effects on the shoot and root nutrient 
      contents of P. tabulaeformis. Fungal inoculation significantly increased 
      different microbial groups and the total soil microorganisms but decreased the 
      microbial diversity under N deficiency stress. In summary, exogenous symbiotic 
      fungal inoculations could increase the growth performance of P. tabulaeformis 
      under N deficiency and normal N supply conditions, but the effects were negative 
      under excessive N addition.

TI  - Environmental Response to Root Secondary Metabolite Accumulation in Paeonia 
      lactiflora: Insights from Rhizosphere Metabolism and Root-Associated Microbial 
      Communities.

AB  - Paeonia lactiflora is a commercial crop with horticultural and medicinal value. 
      Although interactions between plants and microbes are increasingly evident and 
      considered to be drivers of ecosystem service, the regulatory relationship 
      between microbial communities and the growth and root metabolites of P. 
      lactiflora is less well known. Here, soil metabolomics indicated that 
      carbohydrates and organic acids were enriched in the rhizosphere (RS) with higher 
      diversity. Moreover, the variation of root-associated microbiotas between the 
      bulk soil (BS) and the RS of P. lactiflora was investigated via 16S rRNA and 
      internally transcribed spacer (ITS) amplicon sequencing. The RS displayed a 
      low-diversity community dominated by copiotrophs, whereas the BS showed an 
      oligotroph-dominated, high-diversity community. Hierarchical partitioning showed 
      that cation exchange capacity (CEC) was the main factor affecting microbial 
      community diversity. The null model and the dispersion niche continuum index 
      (DNCI) suggested that stochastic processes (dispersal limitation) dominated the 
      community assembly of both the RS and BS. The bacterial-fungal interkingdom 
      networks illustrated that the RS possessed more complex and stable co-occurrence 
      patterns. Meanwhile, positive link numbers and positive cohesion results revealed 
      more cooperative relationships among microbes in the RS. Additionally, random 
      forest model prediction and two partial least-squares path model (PLS-PM) 
      analyses showed that the P. lactiflora root secondary metabolites were 
      comprehensively impacted by soil water content (SWC), mean annual precipitation 
      (MAP), pH (abiotic), and Alternaria (biotic). Collectively, this study provides a 
      theoretical basis for screening the microbiome associated with the active 
      components of P. lactiflora. IMPORTANCE Determining the taxonomic and functional 
      components of the rhizosphere microbiome, as well as how they differ from those 
      of the bulk soil microbiome, is critical for manipulating them to improve plant 
      growth performance and increase agricultural yields. Soil metabolic profiles can 
      help enhance the understanding of rhizosphere exudates. Here, we explored the 
      regulatory relationship across environmental variables (root-associated microbial 
      communities and soil metabolism) in the accumulation of secondary metabolites of 
      P. lactiflora. Overall, this work improves our knowledge of how the rhizosphere 
      affects soil and microbial communities. These observations improve the 
      understanding of plant-microbiome interactions and introduce new horizons for 
      synthetic community investigations as well as the creation of microbiome 
      technologies for agricultural sustainability.

AB  - While investigating the bacterial populations of environmental samples taken from 
      a mix of healthy and Acute Oak Decline afflicted Quercus robur (pedunculate or 
      English oak) rhizosphere soil samples and swabs of bleeding lesions on Tilia spp. 
      (lime) and Quercus rubra (red oak) trees, several strains belonging to the order 
      Enterobacterales were isolated using selective media and enrichment broth. Seven 
      strains from the Q. robur rhizosphere, three strains from Tilia spp. and one from 
      Q. rubra were investigated, with their taxonomic status determined via a 
      polyphasic taxonomic approach. Initially stains were identified as potential 
      members of the recently described genus Scandinavium, based on the partial 
      sequencing of three housekeeping genes. Further analysis of phenotypic traits, 
      including fatty acid profiles, coupled with 16S rRNA gene and phylogenomic 
      analysis of whole genome sequences were applied to a subset of the strains. 
      Phylogenetic and phylogenomic analysis repeatedly placed the isolates in a 
      monophyletic clade within Scandinavium, with four distinct clusters observed, one 
      of which corresponded to Scandinavium goeteborgense, the type species of the 
      genus. The remaining three clusters could be phenotypically and genotypically 
      differentiated from each other and S. goeteborgense. As such, we describe three 
      novel species of the genus, for which we propose the names Scandinavium hiltneri 
      sp. nov. (type strain H11S7(T) = LMG 32612(T) = CCUG 76179(T)), Scandinavium 
      manionii sp. nov. (type strain H17S15(T) = LMG 32613(T) = CCUG 76183(T)) and 
      Scandinavium tedordense sp. nov. (type strain TWS1a(T) = LMG 32614(T) = CCUG 
      76188(T)). Additionally, the descriptions of the genus Scandinavium and the type 
      species, S. goeteborgense, are emended.

LID - 1112
AB  - The plant- and soil-associated microbial communities are critical to plant health 
      and their resilience to stressors, such as drought, pathogens, and pest 
      outbreaks. A better understanding of the structure of microbial communities and 
      how they are affected by different environmental factors is needed to predict and 
      manage ecosystem responses to climate change. In this study, we carried out a 
      country-wide analysis of fungal communities associated with Pinus sylvestris 
      growing under different environmental conditions. Needle, shoot, root, mineral, 
      and organic soil samples were collected at 30 sites. By interconnecting the 
      high-throughput sequencing data, environmental variables, and soil chemical 
      properties, we were able to identify key factors that drive the diversity and 
      composition of fungal communities associated with P. sylvestris. The fungal 
      species richness and community composition were also found to be highly dependent 
      on the site and the substrate they colonize. The results demonstrated that 
      different functional tissues and the rhizosphere soil of P. sylvestris are 
      associated with diverse fungal communities, which are driven by a combination of 
      climatic (temperature and precipitation) and edaphic factors (soil pH), and stand 
      characteristics.

AB  - Increasing food demand coupled with climate change pose a great challenge to 
      agricultural systems. In this review we summarize recent advances in our 
      knowledge of how plants, together with their associated microbiota, shape 
      rhizosphere processes. We address (molecular) mechanisms operating at the 
      plant-microbe-soil interface and aim to link this knowledge with actual and 
      potential avenues for intensifying agricultural systems, while at the same time 
      reducing irrigation water, fertilizer inputs and pesticide use. Combining 
      in-depth knowledge about above and belowground plant traits will not only 
      significantly advance our mechanistic understanding of involved processes but 
      also allow for more informed decisions regarding agricultural practices and plant 
      breeding. Including belowground plant-soil-microbe interactions in our breeding 
      efforts will help to select crops resilient to abiotic and biotic environmental 
      stresses and ultimately enable us to produce sufficient food in a more 
      sustainable agriculture in the upcoming decades.

TI  - A quick and simple spectrophotometric method to determine total carbon 
      concentrations in root exudate samples of grass species.
PG  - 273-281

AB  - PURPOSE: Root exudates are key components driving belowground interaction between 
      plant, microbes and soil. High-end analytical approaches provide advanced 
      insights into exudate metabolite diversity, however, the amount of total carbon 
      (C) released by roots should always be determined as the most basic parameter 
      when characterizing root exudation as it (i) provides quantitative information of 
      C exuded into the surrounding soil and (ii) allows to relate the abundance of 
      individual exudate compounds to total C released. Here we propose a simple and 
      quick, spectrophotometry-based method to quantify total dissolved organic carbon 
      (DOC) concentration in exudation samples that is based on measuring the 
      absorption of a pre-filtered but otherwise untreated exudate sample at 260 nm 
      (DOC(260)). METHOD: Exudate samples collected from different grass genotypes (Zea 
      mays, Oryza sativa, Hordeum vulgare) grown in various experimental settings 
      (soil, hydroponic) were analysed with the DOC(260) assay and results were 
      compared with C concentrations obtained by liquid TOC-analyser. CONCLUSION: We 
      demonstrated that the DOC(260) method allowed for quick and inexpensive 
      measurements of total dissolved organic carbon concentrations in exudate samples 
      from grass species grown under nutrient sufficient as well as under P deficient 
      conditions. Interestingly, DOC(260) failed to predict DOC concentrations in 
      exudate samples from plants grown under Zn and Fe deficiency suggesting a strong 
      shift in metabolite composition under micronutrient deficiency. Even though the 
      applicability of the DOC(260) method remains to be tested on exudate samples 
      originating from dicots and plants exposed to other environmental stresses (e.g. 
      pathogen attack, heavy metal stress, etc), it will help to increase our 
      understanding of root exudation and related rhizosphere processes in the future.

TI  - Long-term continuous mono-cropping of Macadamia integrifolia greatly affects soil 
      physicochemical properties, rhizospheric bacterial diversity, and metabolite 
      contents.

AB  - Macadamia integrifolia is the most economically important Proteaceae crop known 
      for its edible nuts. The present study was conducted to examine the effect of 
      continuous cultivation (for 1, 5, and 20 years) of M. integrifolia on soil 
      quality, bacterial diversity, and metabolites. Soil rhizospheres from three 
      different Macadamia rhizosphere orchards, 1-year monoculture orchard (CK), 5-year 
      monoculture orchard (Y5), and 20-year monoculture orchard (Y20), were analyzed 
      through metagenomic and metabolomic profiling. The soil physicochemical 
      properties, including organic matter, and available nutrients (P, N, and K) were 
      first increased significantly (p < 0.05) from the CK to the Y5 group and then 
      decreased (p < 0.05) from the Y5 to the Y20 group. The soil pH continuously 
      decreased (p < 0.05) over time from CK to Y20. Metagenomic profiling revealed 
      that Actinobacteria, Acidobacteria, and Proteobacteria were the top three 
      abundant phyla with their inconsistent relative abundance patterns from CK to Y20 
      (CK: 23.76%, Y5: 34. 06%, and Y20: 31.55%), (CK: 13.59%, Y5: 18.59%, and Y20: 
      21.35%), and (CK: 27.59%, Y5: 15.98%, and Y20: 17.08%), respectively. 
      Furthermore, the Y5 rhizospheres had a higher number of beneficial bacterial 
      genera belonging to Proteobacteria and Actinobacteria than the Y20 rhizospheres. 
      The KEGG annotation analysis revealed that cellular processes, organism systems, 
      metabolism, and genetic information were the most enriched functional categories. 
      CAZy database screening indicated the highest enrichment of glycoside hydrolases 
      following the glycoside transferases and carbohydrate-binding modules. 
      Differential metabolite analysis revealed the highest number of metabolites (11) 
      in the Y5 group than in the Y20 group (6). It is concluded that continuous 
      monoculture of M. integrifolia improves the soil physicochemical properties, 
      bacterial diversity, and metabolite contents in short-term planted orchards 
      which, however, are deteriorated in long-term planted orchards.

AB  - Understanding plant-microbe interactions could provide the basis for improved 
      phytoremediation, microbial resource utilization, and secondary metabolite 
      production. Rhizosphere bacterial communities are strongly influenced by abiotic 
      factors such as soil nutrient availability and the composition of such 
      communities exhibits differentiation under different host plants. In a deciduous 
      broad-leaved forest in Anhui Province, eastern China, the rhizospheric bacteria 
      of three different tree species of the Rosaceae family (Sorbus alnifolia, Cerasus 
      serrulata, and Photinia beauverdiana) were studied, with the bacteria of the bulk 
      soil as controls. Bacterial community composition was determined using the 
      Illumina platform for high-throughput sequencing of 16S rRNA genes. The results 
      showed that the bacterial community composition varied between rhizospheric and 
      bulk soils, and dominant bacterial phyla as Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria, and 
      Acidobacteria were found in both soils. Information on predicted functional genes 
      and pathways revealed significant differences between rhizospheric and bulk soil 
      bacteria. It provided ample evidence for the different metabolic characteristics 
      of the rhizosphere bacterial communities of the three tree species. Electrical 
      conductivity (22.72%), total phosphorus concentration (21.89%), and urease 
      activity (22%) were the main drivers for changes in the composition of the 
      rhizosphere bacterial communities from the three tree species.

AB  - Nelumbo nucifera (N. nucifera) is an important aquatic economic crop with high 
      edible, medicinal, ornamental, and ecological restoration values. Aerenchyma 
      formation in N. nucifera root is an adaptive trait to the aquatic environment in 
      long-term evolution. In this study, light microscopy, electron microscopy, and 
      molecular biology techniques were used to study the process of the aerenchyma 
      development and cytological events in N. nucifera root and the dynamic changes of 
      aerenchyma formation under the treatment of exogenous 21% oxygen, ethylene (ET), 
      and ET synthesis i + nhibitor 1-methylcyclopropene (1-MCP). The results showed 
      that programmed cell death (PCD) occurred during the aerenchyma formation in N. 
      nucifera root. Plasmalemma invagination and vacuole membrane rupture appeared in 
      the formation stage, followed by nuclear deformation, chromatin condensation and 
      marginalization, and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick end 
      labeling (TUNEL) detection was positive at this time. In the expansion stage of 
      the aerenchyma development, cytoplasmic degradation and many vesicles appeared in 
      the cytoplasm, and organelles began to degrade. Then the plasma membrane began to 
      degrade, and the degradation of the cell wall was the last PCD step. After 21% 
      oxygen was continuously filled in the rhizosphere environment of N. nucifera 
      roots, the area of aerenchyma in N. nucifera roots was smaller than that in the 
      control group. Moreover, ET induced the earlier occurrence of aerenchyma in N. 
      nucifera root, but also, the area of aerenchyma became larger than that of the 
      control. On the contrary, 1-MCP inhibited the occurrence of aerenchyma to some 
      extent. Therefore, the formation of aerenchyma in N. nucifera root resulted from 
      PCD, and its formation mode was schizo-lysigenous. A hypoxic environment could 
      induce aerenchyma formation in plants. ET signal was involved in aerenchyma 
      formation in N. nucifera root and had a positive regulatory effect. This study 
      provides relevant data on the formation mechanism of plant aerenchyma and the 
      cytological basis for exploring the regulation mechanism of plant aerenchyma 
      formation.

AB  - In comparison with ectomycorrhizal (EM) tree species, arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) 
      trees have different litter quality and nitrogen cycle modes, which may affect 
      mycorrhizal colonization and the community composition and diversity. However, 
      available studies addressing the mycorrhizal fungal colonization rate, diversity 
      and community composition in mixed forest stands composed of AM and EM trees are 
      rare. In the present study, we assessed litter quality, soil physicochemical 
      properties and correlated them with mycorrhizal community characteristics in 
      rhizosphere soils of monoculture and mixture plantation stands of AM tree species 
      (Fraxinus mandschurica Rupr.) and EM tree species (Larix gmelinii Rupr., Picea 
      koraiensis Nakai) in Northeast China. We hypothesized that (1) the effect of 
      mixture pattern on mycorrhizal colonization rate and diversity would change with 
      tree species, (2) the effect of mixture pattern on mycorrhizal community 
      composition would be less pronounced in comparison with that of tree species. We 
      found that mixture did not change AMF colonization rate regardless of mixture 
      identity, whereas mixture and tree species exerted significant effects on EMF 
      colonization rate. For AMF community, both M-AS (Fraxinus mandschurica Rupr. and 
      Picea koraiensis Nakai) and M-AL (Fraxinus mandschurica Rupr. and Larix gmelinii 
      Rupr.) mixtures significantly increased Pielou index and Simpson index, whereas 
      only M-AS significantly increased Sobs. For EMF community, mixture significantly 
      affected examined diversity indices except for Chao1. Mixture significantly 
      shifted AMF and EMF community, and the magnitude was tree species dependent. The 
      dominant genera in AMF and EMF communities in plantation stands were Glomus and 
      Tomentella, respectively. The EnvFit analysis showed that the determinant factors 
      of EMF community are soil moisture, pH, nitrate nitrogen content, dissolved 
      organic nitrogen content, soil organic matter content, soil organic carbon/total 
      nitrogen and litter carbon/total nitrogen. In conclusion, mixed conifer-broadleaf 
      trees significantly changed soil physicochemical properties, litter quality as 
      well as mycorrhizal fungi community diversity and composition.

TI  - Modelling the Rhizosphere Priming Effect in Combination with Soil Food Webs to 
      Quantify Interaction between Living Plant, Soil Biota and Soil Organic Matter.
LID - 10.3390/plants11192605 [doi]
LID - 2605
AB  - A model of rhizosphere priming effect under impact of root exudate input into 
      rhizosphere soil was developed as an important process of the plant-soil 
      interaction. The model was based on the concept of nitrogen (N) mining, 
      compensating for the N scarcity in exudates for microbial growth by accelerating 
      SOM mineralisation. In the model, N deficiency for microbial growth is covered 
      ("mined") by the increased SOM mineralisation depending on the C:N ratio of the 
      soil and exudates. The new aspect in the model is a food web procedure, which 
      calculates soil fauna feeding on microorganisms, the return of faunal by-products 
      to SOM and mineral N production for root uptake. The model verification 
      demonstrated similar magnitude of the priming effect in simulations as in the 
      published experimental data. Model testing revealed high sensitivity of the 
      simulation results to N content in exudates. Simulated CO(2) emission from the 
      priming can reach 10-40% of CO(2) emission from the whole Ah horizon of boreal 
      forest soil depending on root exudation rates. This modeling approach with 
      including food web activity allows quantifying wider aspects of the priming 
      effect functioning including ecologically important available N production.

AB  - Mangroves are often exposed to heavy metals that accumulate in the food chain, 
      generate toxicity to mangrove plants and affect microbial diversity. This study 
      determined the abundance of genes associated with resistance and tolerance to 
      heavy metals in the rhizosphere microbiome of Avicennia germinans from a 
      semi-arid mangrove of La Guajira-Colombia by metagenomics and genomics approach. 
      Twenty-eight genes associated with tolerance and 49 genes related to resistance 
      to heavy metals were detected. Genes associated with tolerance and resistance to 
      Cu, especially cusA and copA, were the most abundant. The highest number of genes 
      for tolerance and resistance were for Zn and Co, respectively. The isolate Vibrio 
      fluvialis showed the ability to tolerate Cu, Ni, Zn, and Cd. This work used a 
      complementary approach of metagenomics and genomics to characterize the potential 
      of mangrove microorganisms to tolerate and resist heavy metals and the influence 
      of salinity on their abundance.

AB  - Rhizosphere bacterial diversity and community structure are important factors 
      involving in plant growth. However, the exact process of how plant rhizosphere 
      bacterial community structures is assembled remains unclear. To investigate the 
      role of bacterial chemotaxis to rhizosphere secretions in the establishment of 
      rhizosphere microbial community in Casuarina equisetifolia, we screened bacteria 
      strains derived from the rhizosphere of Casuarina equisetifolia L. using top 
      three chemicals of the plant root exudates (2,4-di-tert-butylphenol, methyl 
      stearate, and arginine) as chemoattractant. Among 72 bacterial strains, five 
      showed strong chemotaxis to 2,4-di-tert-butylphenol, six to methyl stearate, and 
      eleven to arginine, with the highest bacterial chemotaxis occurring at a 
      concentration of 60 muM. This indicates that arginine is a more important 
      chemoattractant than 2,4-di-tert-butylphenol, methyl stearate in the 
      establishment of rhizosphere microbial community in Casuarina equisetifolia. 
      Bacterial community assembly analysis using different chemoattractants and 
      chemoattractants-plus-bacteria combinations were then performed by burying 
      laboratory prepared bags of sterlized soil into C. equisetifolia forest. Bacteria 
      diversity and enrichment analyses using 16S rDNA sequencing at 7 and 14 days 
      after burying showed that arginine-plus-Ochrobactrum sp. and Pantoea sp. 
      treatment exhibited the greatest similarity to the natural forest bacterial 
      community. Our date provides new insights into how chemoattractants and 
      chemotactic bacteria strains shape the rhizosphere microbial community of C. 
      equisetifolia, which constitutes foundational information for future management 
      of these communities.

TI  - Bacterial community in soil and tree roots of Picea abies shows little response 
      to clearcutting.

LID - 10.1093/femsec/fiac118 [doi]
AB  - Clearcutting represents a standard management practice in temperate forests with 
      dramatic consequences for the forest ecosystem. The removal of trees responsible 
      for the bulk of primary production can result in a complex response of the soil 
      microbiome. While studies have shown that tree root-symbiotic ectomycorrhizal 
      fungi disappear from soil and decomposing fine roots of trees become a hotspot 
      for fungal decomposition, the fate of the bacterial component of the soil 
      microbiome following clearcutting is unclear. Here, we investigated the response 
      of bacterial community composition for 2 years following clearcutting of a Picea 
      abies stand in soil, rhizosphere and tree roots, by 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing. 
      While in the first few months after clearcutting there was no significant 
      response of bacterial community composition in the rhizosphere and soil, 
      bacterial communities associated with tree roots underwent more profound changes 
      over time. Acidobacteria were abundant in rhizosphere and soil, while Firmicutes 
      were strongly represented in the roots. In addition, bacterial communities on 
      decomposing roots were significantly different from those on pre-clearcut live 
      roots. Compared with fungi, the response of bacterial communities to clearcutting 
      was much less pronounced, indicating independent development of the two microbial 
      domains.

TI  - First Report of Dieback of Quercus suber Trees Associated with Phytophthora 
      quercina in Morocco.
LID - 10.1094/PDIS-08-22-1795-PDN [doi]
AB  - Cork oak (Quercus suber L.) is an evergreen tree native to SW Europe and NW 
      Africa. It covers 2.106 ha in the western Mediterranean basin, forms 
      heterogeneous forest ecosystems and represents an important source of income 
      derived from cork production. While in Iberia, Italy, Tunisia and Algeria, 
      drought and several endemic pathogens have been associated with cork oak decline 
      (Moricca et al. 2016; Smahi et al. 2017), in Morocco there is no evidence, apart 
      from overgrazing and human intervention (Fennane and Rejdali 2015), of a pathogen 
      associated with oak decline. In December 2019, extensive dieback and mortality of 
      60-year-old cork oak trees were observed in a natural stand of ca 150 ha located 
      5 km east from Touazithe, in Maamora forest, Morocco (34 degrees 13'38''N, 6 degrees 14'51''W - 
      87 m a.s.l.). Two years before, Q. suber seedlings from a local nursery were 
      planted to increase tree density. Symptoms in trees and planted seedlings 
      included chlorosis, reddish-brown discoloration of the whole crown and dieback 
      starting in the upper crown. Root rot and lack of fine roots were observed. Tree 
      mortality was estimated at ca 30%, and disease incidences of trees and seedlings 
      were 45 and 70%, respectively. A Phytophthora species was consistently isolated 
      from the rhizosphere of 3 symptomatic trees randomly selected at the site using 
      leaves as bait (Jung et al. 1996). On carrot agar Phytophthora colonies were 
      uniform and cottonwool-like. Sporangia were typically terminal, with ovoid, and 
      obpyriform shape, mostly papillate, measuring 30.7 +/- 4.7 microm length and 22.7 +/- 4.1 
      microm wide. Oogonia were produced in single culture, and they were globose to 
      subglobose, elongated to ellipsoid, 32.1 +/- 2.9 microm in diameter and 46.1 +/- 4.8 microm 
      in length. Oospores were usually spherical, thick-walled, and measured 28.1 +/- 2.4 
      microm. Antheridia were paragynous, mostly spherical, measuring 12.2 +/- 1.4 microm. 
      Isolates had minimum and maximum temperatures of 5  degrees C and 30  degrees C, respectively, 
      and a growth optimum at 20  degrees C. Apart from the small size of sporangia, features 
      were typical of Phytophthora quercina Jung. The identity of a representative 
      strain (TJ1500) was corroborated by sequencing the ITS and mitochondrial cox1 
      gene regions, and BLAST search in GenBank showed 100% homology with sequences of 
      the ex-type culture of P. quercina (KF358229 and KF358241 accessions, 
      respectively). Both sequences of the representative isolate were submitted to 
      GenBank (accessions OP086243 and OP290549). The strain TJ1500 is currently stored 
      within the culture collections of the Mendel University in Brno and the 
      University of Sassari. Its pathogenicity was verified and compared with a P. 
      cinnamomi strain in a soil infestation test with one-year-old cork oak seedlings 
      (Corcobado et al. 2017). Five months after inoculation, the symptoms described 
      were observed in the seedlings, and fine root weight of plants inoculated with 
      the TJ1500 strain and P. cinnamomi was reduced by 19 and 42%, respectively, in 
      relation to non-inoculated controls. The pathogen was re-isolated from the 
      necrotic roots, thus fulfilling Koch's postulates. So far, P. quercina has been 
      reported associated with chronic mortality of cork oak in new plantations in 
      Spain (Martin-Garcia et al. 2015; Jung et al. 2016) and natural forests in Italy 
      (Seddaiu et al. 2020). To our knowledge this is the first report of P. quercina 
      in Morocco. Givenat Morocco is an important cork producing country, our finding 
      warns about the risk this pathogen poses to Q. suber and other North African 
      oaks.

AB  - The rhizosphere is one of the most dynamic interfaces on the Earth. Understanding 
      the magnitudes of rhizosphere effects (RE, difference in bio-physicochemical 
      properties between rhizosphere and bulk soils) on soil microbial communities and 
      their moderators is important for studying on below-ground carbon (C) cycling. A 
      comprehensive meta-analysis was conducted to quantify the REs on soil microbial 
      biomass, community structure, respiration, and C-degrading enzymes. We found that 
      REs on soil C and nutrients, total microbial biomass, the abundance of specific 
      microbial groups, fungi to bacteria ratio, respiration, and C-degrading enzymes 
      were positive, but the magnitudes were varied with biomes, plant functional 
      types, and mycorrhizal types. REs on microbial biomass, respiration, and 
      C-degrading enzymes increased with the increase of mean annual temperature and 
      mean annual precipitation, but decreased with the increase of soil clay, C, 
      nitrogen (N), and phosphorus (P) contents. The REs on microbial biomass and 
      respiration also increased as the REs on soil C:N:P increased. Compared with bulk 
      soil, per unit rhizosphere soil C supported more microbial biomass, per unit of 
      which respired more C, leading to faster C decomposition in rhizosphere. Our 
      findings indicate that the increase in microbial biomass, co-metabolism induced 
      by labile and energy-rich organic C of root exudates, and overflow respiration 
      induced by stoichiometric imbalance together contribute to the enhanced C 
      decomposition in rhizosphere. The global pattern of REs on soil microbial 
      communities is critical to revealing the plant-microbe-soil interactions in 
      terrestrial ecosystems.

TI  - Sugarcane Rhizosphere Bacteria Community Migration Correlates with Growth Stages 
      and Soil Nutrient.

LID - 10303
AB  - Plants and rhizosphere bacterial microbiota have intimate relationships. As 
      neighbors of the plant root system, rhizosphere microorganisms have a crucial 
      impact on plant growth and health. In this study, we sampled rhizosphere soil of 
      sugarcane in May (seedling), July (tillering), September (elongation) and 
      November (maturity), respectively. We employ 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing to 
      investigate seasonal variations in rhizosphere bacteria community structure and 
      abundance, as well as their association with soil edaphic factors. The results 
      demonstrate that soil pH, total nitrogen (TN) and available nitrogen (AN) 
      decrease substantially with time. Rhizosphere bacteria diversity (Shannon) and 
      the total enriched OTUs are also significantly higher in July relative to other 
      months. Bacteria OTUs and functional composition exhibit a strong and significant 
      correlation with soil temperature (Tem), suggesting that Tem was the potential 
      determinant controlling rhizosphere bacteria diversity, enriched OTUs as well as 
      functional composition. Redundancy analysis (RDA) point toward soil total 
      potassium (TK), pH, TN, Tem and AN as principal determinant altering shifting 
      bacteria community structure. Variation partitioning analysis (VPA) analysis 
      further validate that a substantial proportion of variation (70.79%) detected in 
      the rhizosphere bacteria community structure was attributed to edaphic factors. 
      Mfuzz analysis classified the bacterial genera into four distinct clusters, with 
      cluster two exhibiting a distinct and dramatic increase in July, predominantly 
      occupied by Allocatelliglobosispora. The stochastic forest model found the key 
      characteristic bacterial populations that can distinguish the four key growth 
      periods of sugarcane. It may help us to answer some pending questions about the 
      interaction of rhizosphere microorganisms with plants in the future.

TI  - Phytophthora x cambivora as a Major Factor Inciting the Decline of European Beech 
      in a Stand within the Southernmost Limit of Its Natural Range in Europe.

AB  - The objective of this study was to investigate the role of the oomycete 
      Phytophthorax cambivora in the decline affecting European beech (Fagus sylvatica) 
      in the Nebrodi Regional Park (Sicily, southern Italy). In a survey of a beech 
      forest stand in the heart of the park, Phytophthorax cambivora was the sole 
      Phytophthora species recovered from the rhizosphere soil and fine roots of trees. 
      Both A1 and A2 mating type isolates were found. Direct isolation from the stem 
      bark of trees showing severe decline symptoms and bleeding stem cankers yielded 
      exclusively P. gonapodyides, usually considered as an opportunistic pathogen. The 
      mean inoculum density of P.x cambivora in the rhizosphere soil, as determined 
      using the soil dilution plating method and expressed in terms of colony forming 
      units (cfus) per gm of soil, the isolation frequency using leaf baiting, and the 
      percentage of infected fibrous roots from 20 randomly selected beech trees with 
      severe decline symptoms (50 to 100 foliage transparency classes) were 31.7 cfus, 
      80%, and 48.6%, respectively. These were significantly higher than the 
      corresponding mean values of 20 asymptomatic or slightly declining trees, 
      suggesting P.x cambivora is a major factor responsible for the decline in the 
      surveyed stand.

TI  - Microbial respiratory thermal adaptation is regulated by r-/K-strategy dominance.
PG  - 2489-2499
LID - 10.1111/ele.14106 [doi]
AB  - Microbial thermal adaptation is considered to be one of the core mechanisms 
      affecting soil carbon cycling. However, the role of microbial community 
      composition in controlling thermal adaptation is poorly understood. Using 
      microbial communities from the rhizosphere and bulk soils in an 8-year warming 
      experiment as a model, we experimentally demonstrate that respiratory thermal 
      adaptation was much stronger in microbial K-strategist-dominated bulk soils than 
      in microbial r-strategist-dominated rhizosphere soils. Soil carbon availability 
      exerted strong selection on the dominant ecological strategy of the microbial 
      community, indirectly influencing respiratory thermal adaptation. Our findings 
      shed light on the linchpin of the dominant ecological strategy exhibited by the 
      microbial community in determining its respiratory thermal adaptation, with 
      implications for understanding soil carbon losses under warming.

TI  - [Community structure of phyllosphere fungi associated with dominant tree species 
      in a broad-leaved Korean pine forest of Changbai Mountain, Northeast China].
PG  - 2405-2412
LID - 10.13287/j.1001-9332.202209.035 [doi]
AB  - Forest is the main component of terrestrial ecosystems that harbors about 40% of 
      the existing species on the earth. As a vital component of biodiversity, 
      phyllosphere microbes in the canopy play a critical and unique role in 
      maintaining plant health, improving host resistance, and influencing global 
      biogeochemical cycle. However, the studies on the community structure of 
      phyllosphere fungi in natural forests are scarce as compared to that on 
      rhizosphere microbes. Consequently, we know litter about how phyllosphere fungi 
      associates with leaf traits. In this study, we analyzed fungal community 
      composition of canopy leaves of six dominant tree species (i.e., Pinus 
      koraiensis, Tilia amurensis, Quercus mongolica, Acer mono, Fraxinus mandshurica, 
      and Ulmus japonica), in a broad-leaved Korean pine forest of Changbai Mountain 
      Nature Reserve in Jilin Province, using high-throughput sequencing. We compared 
      the differences of phyllosphere fungal community structure and functional groups 
      of different dominant tree species. Moreover, 14 key leaf functional traits of 
      their host trees were measured to investigate the relationships between fungal 
      community composition and leaf functional traits. We found that the dominant 
      phyla and class of phyllosphere fungi were Ascomycota and Basidiomycota, and 
      Dothideomycetes and Taphrinomycetes, respectively. Results of LEfSe analysis 
      indicated that all the tree species except Ulmus japonica had significant 
      biomarkers, such as the Eurotiomycetes of Pinus koraiensis and the Ascomycetes of 
      Quercus mongolica. The main functional groups of phyllosphere fungi were 
      pathotroph. The results of redundancy and envfit analysis showed that functional 
      traits related to plant nutrient acquisition as well as resistance to diseases 
      and pests were the main factors influencing the community structure of 
      phyllosphere fungi.

AB  - Pinus bungeana is a native but endangered plant species in China, with high 
      ornamental value and adaptability to drought and cold. The relationship between 
      the soil community structure and endophytic microbes in the tissues of P. 
      bungeana under different health statuses is poorly understood. In this study, the 
      endophytic bacterial and fungal communities of P. bungeana under different health 
      statuses were compared and analyzed in the Xiong'an New Area. Using 
      high-throughput deep sequencing [16S and internal transcribed spacer (ITS) rRNA] 
      techniques, the effect of the health status of P. bungeana on the microbial 
      communities in bulk soil, rhizospheric soil, roots, stems, and leaves was 
      determined in this study. We observed that the diversity of the bacterial and 
      fungal communities of the aboveground parts (stems and leaves) of healthy P. 
      bungeana plants was much higher than that of the unhealthy plants. However, the 
      diversity of bacterial and fungal communities in the belowground parts (bulk 
      soil, rhizospheric soil, and roots) showed almost no difference in microbial 
      community richness, indicating that the possible cause of illness was transmitted 
      in a "top-down" manner. Furthermore, there were significant differences in the 
      microbial diversity and community structure in different ecological niches of P. 
      bungeana (P < 0.01). Proteobacteria and Actinobacteria were the dominant 
      bacterial phyla, while Ascomycota, Basidiomycota, and Mortierellomycota were the 
      predominant fungal phyla. Redundancy analysis (RDA) revealed that soil organic 
      matter (SOM), total phosphorous (TP), total potassium (TK), total nitrogen (TN), 
      water content (WC), power of hydrogen (pH), total carbon (TC), and the ratio of 
      carbon to nitrogen (C/N) were significantly correlated with the composition of 
      the microbial communities. Altogether, these results provide a scientific basis 
      for further studies on the mechanism underlying the "aboveground-underground" 
      microbial interactions in plantation forests, which can aid in promoting the 
      healthy and sustainable development of the Millennium Xiulin forest in the 
      Xiong'an New Area.

LID - 10.1111/gcb.16432 [doi]
AB  - Increased belowground C allocation of trees, especially enhanced rhizodeposition, 
      might lead to long-term C sequestration in forest soil. Microbes are crucial 
      players in this complex process of forming stable soil organic carbon (SOC).

AB  - As the excessive use of chemical fertilizers harms organisms and adversely 
      affects the soil environment, the replacement of chemical fertilizers with 
      biological fertilizers has attracted widespread attention as an environmental 
      protection strategy. In this study, the effects of rhizosphere bacteria 
      inoculation on growth of Pinus sylvestris var. mongolica seedlings, soil 
      parameters, soil microbial community structure, and the biocontrol of damping-off 
      were studied by pot experiments. The results showed that all three rhizosphere 
      bacteria (Pseudomonas chlororaphis, Pseudomonas extremaustralis, and 
      Acinetobacter lwoffii A07) tested exhibited growth-promoting properties, such as 
      the production of indole-3-acetic acid, hydrolase, siderophores, and hydrogen 
      cyanide; nitrogen fixation; and phosphorus solubilization. The application of the 
      three bacteria increased plant biomass, root structure, and nutrient content and 
      also increased soil nutrient content and enzyme activity. Bacterial inoculation 
      promoted the growth of beneficial bacteria and antagonistic bacteria by adjusting 
      the physicochemical properties of the soil, thereby improving the bacterial 
      community structure. Among the soil features, available nitrogen, total nitrogen, 
      available potassium, and urease activity were the main influencing factors. In 
      addition, it was also found that bacterial inoculation significantly increased 
      the activities of plant superoxide dismutase, catalase, peroxidase, and other 
      defense enzymes; enhanced plant disease resistance; effectively inhibited 
      damping-off; and promoted plant growth. In summary, the application of three 
      rhizosphere bacteria systematically affected the interaction between plants, soil 
      parameters, and soil microbial communities. These results provide a basis for 
      understanding how rhizosphere bacteria promote the growth of P. sylvestris var. 
      mongolica, thereby offering a promising sustainable alternative to chemical 
      fertilizers.

AB  - Saline soils resulting from anthropogenic activity and climate change present a 
      challenge to future food security. Towards addressing this, we isolated and 
      characterized halotolerant bacteria from a Malaysian mangrove forest, and 
      explored their effect on morpho-physiological and biochemical parameters of 
      banana plantlets under salt stress. A total of 88 rhizobacterial and 16 
      endophytic bacterial isolates collected from the roots and rhizosphere of 
      Rhizophora apiculata, Avicennia alba and Sonneratia alba, were found to tolerate 
      up to 400 mM of sea salt. Based on best performance in multiple plant growth 
      traits, three rhizobacterial strains RB1, RB3 and RB4 and three endophytic 
      bacterial strains EB1, EB2 and EB3 were used for further analysis. The 
      rhizobacterial strains were identified as Bacillus sp. and endophytic bacteria as 
      Pseudomonas sp. based on 16 S rRNA gene sequence. SEM observation confirmed 
      colonization of each strain on banana plantlet roots. When colonized plantlets 
      were subjected to 90 mM salt and compared to uninoculated (control) and mock 
      inoculated plants, improved plant growth was observed with each of the strains, 
      especially with bacterial strains EB3 and RB3. Biochemical analysis of plantlets 
      revealed that root colonization with EB3 and RB3 enhanced levels of plant 
      chlorophyll (> 5-fold), carotenoid (> 2.85-fold) and proline (2.6-fold and 
      2.3-fold), while plantlets also showed reduced MDA content (0.45-fold and 
      0.51-fold), significantly reduced generation of ROS (0.23-fold and 0.47-fold) and 
      lower levels of electrolyte leakage (0.77 and 0.51-fold). Antioxidant enzymes 
      also showed enhanced activity with EB3 and RB3. Our results indicate that these 
      halotolerant Bacillus and Pseudomonas strains from the mangrove have 
      multifunctional plant growth promoting activity and can reduce salt stress in 
      bananas. This data provides a reference for exploring halotolerant microbes from 
      hypersaline environments to overcome salt stress in plants.

AB  - Dioecious plants show sexual differences in resistance traits to abiotic 
      stresses. However, the effects of exogenous pesticide application on female and 
      male plant growth and their associated adaptation mechanisms are unclear. Our 
      study investigated the effects of the broad-spectrum pesticide lambda-cyhalothrin 
      (lambda-CY) on dioecious Populus cathayana growth and explored the factors through 
      which lambda-CY changed the rhizosphere bacterial community and physicochemical soil 
      properties via sex-specific metabolomics. The sequential application of lambda-CY 
      significantly suppressed male shoot- and root biomass, with little effect on the 
      growth of females. Females possessed a higher intrinsic chemo-diversity within 
      their root exudates, and their levels of various metabolites (sugars, fatty 
      acids, and small organic acids) increased after exposure to lambda-CY with 
      consequences on bacterial community composition. Maintaining high bacterial alpha 
      diversity and recruiting specific bacterial groups slowed down the loss of 
      rhizosphere nutrients in females. In contrast, the reduction in bacterial alpha 
      diversity and network structure stability in males was associated with lower 
      rhizosphere nutrient availability. Spearman's correlation analysis revealed that 
      several bacterial groups were positively correlated with the root secretion of 
      lipids and organic acids, suggesting that these metabolites can affect the soil 
      bacterial groups actively involved in the nutrient pool. This study provided 
      novel insights that root exudates and soil microbial interactions may mediate 
      sex-specific differences in response to pesticide application.

AB  - In the Gurbantunggut Desert of northwest China, the main habitat of Rhombomys 
      opimus (great gerbil) is under the thickets of Haloxylon ammodendron, the main 
      construction species. In the long-term coexistence, continuous gerbil activities 
      (burrowing, defecating, and gnawing) limited the growth of H. ammodendron, 
      affected the root microenvironment under the H. ammodendron forest, and weakened 
      the desert ecosystem. However, there is a lack of general understanding about the 
      response of desert soil microhabitats to such gerbil disturbance. Accordingly, 
      this study examined the effects of different intensities of gerbil disturbance 
      (none, mild, moderate, or severe disturbances) on soil nutrients content and used 
      high-throughput sequencing to explore the change in diversity and structure of 
      microbial communities (bacteria and fungi) in H. ammodendron rhizosphere at 
      different soil depths (0-20, 20-40, and 40-60 cm). In the arid desert ecosystem, 
      compared with the soil fungal community, the alpha diversity of the soil 
      bacterial community was significantly affected by gerbil disturbance. Meanwhile, 
      both soil depth and gerbil disturbance significantly impacted the beta diversity 
      and relative abundance of soil bacterial and fungal communities. In addition, 
      gerbil disturbance significantly altered the soil characteristics affecting the 
      distribution and composition of soil microbial communities in H. ammodendron 
      rhizosphere, especially the soil bacterial community. This survey provides 
      evidence that remold impact of gerbil disturbance on soil microenvironment of H. 
      ammodendron rhizosphere in desert ecosystems in northwest China, which helps to 
      further understand the potential correlations with changes in the microbial 
      community at a regional scale.

      soil microorganisms (rhizosphere and bulk soils) in Chinese fir seedlings exposed 
      to successive planting soils (first-generation Chinese fir seedings, FCP. 
      second-generation Chinese fir seedings, SCP. third-generation Chinese fir 
      seedings, TCP) and broadleaf tree species soil (Phoebe zhennan S. Lee et F. N. 
      Wei, CK) were examined with high-throughput sequencing technology. Our findings 
      revealed that the diversity and richness of bacterial and fungal communities were 
      remarkably reduced in TCP than FCP and SCP, and were remarkably different between 
      FCP and SCP. At the phylum level, the fungi with greatest relative abundance were 
      Basidiomycota (5.74-32.88%) and Ascomycota (57.63-87.38%), while the bacteria 
      with the greatest relative abundance were Acidobacteria (23.16-31.17%) and 
      Proteobacteria (24.71-29.32%) for all treatments in both soil types. 
      Additionally, the relative abundance of some pathogens (Penicillium and 
      Burkholderia) was significantly higher in TCP than in FCP and SCP, suggesting 
      that the presence of pathogens is an important factor in increasing the incidence 
      of soil-borne sickness. Moreover, changes in fungal and bacterial communities 
      were predominantly driven by soil dissolved organic carbon (DOC), DOC/DON ratio 
      (DOCN), NO(3) (-)-N, microbial biomass carbon (MBC), and MBC/MBN ratio (MBCN). 
      Overall, the long-term monoculture of Chinese fir promotes the microecological 
      imbalance of rhizosphere and bulk soil, and remarkably reduced soil microbial 
      community diversity. These results can provide a scientific support for the 
      implementation of future management measures for fir plantations (e.g., 
      fertilization, addition of microbial fungicides, and construction of mixed 
      forests).

AB  - Biodegradable microplastics (MPs) can impact the accumulation of cadmium (Cd) by 
      plants, however, its mechanisms have not been fully understood. In this study, 
      two biodegradable MPs, polypropylene carbonate (PPC) and polylactic acid (PLA), 
      were used to examine their influences on the uptake of Cd in rice plants. Results 
      showed that PPC significantly reduced the accumulation of Cd in rice root and 
      aerial part, whereas PLA increased the Cd concentrations in rice root. The random 
      forest analysis revealed that the bacterial biomarkers enriched by two MPs were 
      different at genus level. Niche breadths were significantly reduced under Cd 
      stress, and PPC alleviated this environmental pressure for entire bacterial 
      community, whereas PLA reduced the niche breadth for whole community and abundant 
      taxa, which was further verified by co-occurrence network and normalized 
      stochasticity ratio model. The abundant taxa of group PPC were primarily governed 
      by deterministic process while rare taxa were more driven by stochastic process. 
      Structural equation model and Mantel analysis identified that the niche breadth 
      imposed a strong selection on Cd accumulation after co-exposure. This study 
      reveals the underlying mechanism of assembly process and niche breadth of rice 
      rhizosphere microbiome on Cd accumulation by rice plants.

AB  - To study the effects of different regeneration methods on the growth and 
      bacterial community diversity of Populus x euramericana cv. '74/76' (poplar 107), 
      we investigated the growth of poplar 107 trees under three regeneration methods 
      in 2017 and 2020, and sequenced the 16S rDNA V5-V7 regions in stem endophytic, 
      root endophytic, and rhizosphere soil bacteria present in samples from the three 
      regeneration methods using the Illumina high-throughput sequencing platform. The 
      growth analysis showed that stump grafting regeneration (ST) and stump sprouting 
      regeneration (SP) presented similar tree height and diameter at breast height 
      (DBH), which were significantly lower by planted seedling regeneration (CK). The 
      high-throughput sequencing results showed that the rhizosphere soil bacteria 
      appeared to be significantly more diverse and rich than the root and stem 
      endophytic bacteria. Cluster analysis showed that the similarity of bacterial 
      community structure among the rhizosphere soil, root, and stem was small. Thus, 
      the three sample types showed significant differences in bacteria. While 
      comparing the two years, 2020 was significantly more diverse and rich than 2017. 
      With the increase in stand age, the abundance of Proteobacteria increased and the 
      abundance of Acidobacteria decreased. Among the three regeneration methods, ST 
      significantly increased the diversity of stem endophytic bacteria. Chthoniobacter 
      was enriched in SP, which promoted the decomposition of organic matter, and more 
      plant growth promoting rhizobacteria (PGPR) were accumulated in the rhizosphere 
      of SP and ST. The composition of the bacterial community was similar in the three 
      regeneration methods, but the community composition was different. Regeneration 
      and transformation of poplar plantations can be better carried out by stump 
      grafting and stump sprouting.

TI  - Evaluating the Rhizosphere and Endophytic Microbiomes of a Bamboo Plant in 
      Response to the Long-Term Application of Heavy Organic Amendment.
LID - 10.3390/plants11162129 [doi]
LID - 2129
AB  - Root-associated bacteria play a major role in plant health and productivity. 
      However, how organic amendment influences root-associated bacteria is uncertain 
      in Lei bamboo (Phyllostachys praecox) plantations. Here, we compared the 
      rhizosphere and endophytic microbiomes in two Lei bamboo plantations with (IMS) 
      and without (TMS) the application of organic amendment for 16 years. The results 
      showed IMS significantly increased (p < 0.05) the relative abundance of 
      Proteobacteria and significantly decreased (p < 0.05) the relative abundance of 
      Acidobacteria, Bacteroidetes, and Verrucomicrobiota. The root endophytic 
      Proteobacteria and Acidobacteria were significantly higher in abundance (p < 
      0.05) in the IMS than in the TMS, while Actinobacteria and Firmicutes were 
      significantly lower in abundance. Five taxa were assigned to Proteobacteria and 
      Acidobacteria, which were identified as keystones in the rhizosphere soil 
      microbiome, while two species taxonomically affiliated with Proteobacteria were 
      identified as keystones in the root endophytic microbiota, indicating this phylum 
      can be an indicator for a root-associated microbiome in response to IMS. The soil 
      pH, soil total organic carbon (TOC), total nitrogen (TN), total phosphorus (TP), 
      available potassium (AK), and TOC:TP ratio were significantly correlated (p < 
      0.05) with the bacterial community composition of both rhizosphere soils and root 
      endophytes. TMS increased the microbial network complexity of root endophytes but 
      decreased the microbial network complexity of rhizosphere soil. Our results 
      suggest IMS shapes the rhizosphere and endophytic bacterial community 
      compositions and their interactions differently, which should be paid attention 
      to when designing management practices for the sustainable development of forest 
      ecosystems.

      an exotic plantation (Pinus-Eucalyptus) in south-central Chile. We focused on 
      rhizosphere-inhabiting and peloton-associated OMF in a native forest (Andes 
      Cordillera) and a mixed forest (Coastal Cordillera). The native terrestrial 
      orchids G. lutea and C. collicensis were localized, mycorrhizal root segments 
      were taken to isolate peloton-associated OMF, and rhizosphere soil was taken to 
      perform the metabarcoding approach. The results revealed that Basidiomycota and 
      Ascomycota were the main rhizosphere-inhabiting fungal phyla, showing significant 
      differences in the composition of fungal communities in both sites. Sebacina was 
      the most-abundant OMF genera in the rhizosphere of G. lutea growing in the native 
      forest soil. In contrast, Thanatephorus was the most abundant mycorrhizal taxa 
      growing in the rhizosphere of orchids from the Coastal Cordillera. Besides, other 
      OMF genera such as Inocybe, Tomentella, and Mycena were detected. The diversity 
      of OMF in pelotons differed, being mainly related to Ceratobasidium sp. and 
      Tulasnella sp. These results provide evidence of differences in OMF from pelotons 
      and the rhizosphere soil in G. lutea growing in the Andes Cordillera and a 
      selection of microbial communities in the rhizosphere of C. collicensis in the 
      Coastal Cordillera. This raises questions about the efficiency of propagation 
      strategies based only on mycorrhizal fungi obtained by culture-dependent methods, 
      especially in orchids that depend on non-culturable taxa for seed germination and 
      plantlet development.

AB  - Forest soil microbiomes have crucial roles in carbon storage, biogeochemical 
      cycling and rhizosphere processes. Wildfire season length, and the frequency and 
      size of severe fires have increased owing to climate change. Fires affect 
      ecosystem recovery and modify soil microbiomes and microbially mediated 
      biogeochemical processes. To study wildfire-dependent changes in soil 
      microbiomes, we characterized functional shifts in the soil microbiota (bacteria, 
      fungi and viruses) across burn severity gradients (low, moderate and high 
      severity) 1 yr post fire in coniferous forests in Colorado and Wyoming, USA. We 
      found severity-dependent increases of Actinobacteria encoding genes for heat 
      resistance, fast growth, and pyrogenic carbon utilization that might enhance 
      post-fire survival. We report that increased burn severity led to the loss of 
      ectomycorrhizal fungi and less tolerant microbial taxa. Viruses remained active 
      in post-fire soils and probably influenced carbon cycling and biogeochemistry via 
      turnover of biomass and ecosystem-relevant auxiliary metabolic genes. Our 
      genome-resolved analyses link post-fire soil microbial taxonomy to functions and 
      reveal the complexity of post-fire soil microbiome activity.

AB  - Plant and soil microbial community composition play a central role in maintaining 
      ecosystem functioning. Most studies have focused on soil microbes in the bulk 
      soil, the rhizosphere and inside plant roots, however, less is known about the 
      soil community that exists within soil aggregates, and how these soil communities 
      influence plant biomass production. Here, using field-conditioned soil collected 
      from experimental ungrazed and grazed grasslands in Inner Mongolia, China, we 
      examined the composition of microbiomes inside soil aggregates of various size 
      classes, and determined their roles in plant-soil feedbacks (PSFs), 
      diversity-productivity relationships, and diversity-dependent overyielding. We 
      found that grazing induced significantly positive PSF effects, which appeared to 
      be mediated by mycorrhizal fungi, particularly under plant monocultures. Despite 
      this, non-additive effects of microbiomes within different soil aggregates 
      enhanced the strength of PSF under ungrazed grassland, but decreased PSF strength 
      under intensively grazed grassland. Plant mixture-related increases in PSF 
      effects markedly enhanced diversity-dependent overyielding, primarily due to 
      complementary effects. Selection effects played far less of a role. Our work 
      suggests that PSF contributes to diversity-dependent overyielding in grasslands 
      via non-additive effects of microbiomes within different soil aggregates. The 
      implication of our work is that assessing the effectiveness of sustainable 
      grassland restoration and management on soil properties requires inspection of 
      soil aggregate size-specific microbiomes, as these are relevant determinants of 
      the feedback interactions between soil and plant performance.

LID - 10.1099/ijsem.0.005538 [doi]
AB  - In this study, we isolated a novel Gram-stain-positive, aerobic, motile, 
      rod-shaped bacterium, named GX 13764(T), from the rhizosphere soil of a decayed 
      mangrove plant Kandelia candel collected from Beihai, Guangxi, PR China, and 
      characterized using a polyphasic taxonomic approach. The strain exhibited 
      yellow-orange, round, convex, shiny, smooth, opaque and 2-3 mm diameter colonies 
      on marine agar 2216 media after 3 days of incubation at 30  degrees C and was capable of 
      growth at 4-45  degrees C (optimum, 30  degrees C), pH 5.0-9.0 (optimum, pH 7.0) and 0-4 % NaCl 
      (w/v; optimum, 2 %). The strain was positive for catalase and negative for the 
      oxidase. The main cellular fatty acid was anteiso-C(15:0), iso-C(15:0), 
      iso-C(16:0) and iso-C(14:0). The cell-wall peptidoglycan comprised 
      meso-diaminopimelic acid and the main menaquinone was MK-7. The polar lipids 
      included one diphosphatidylglycerol, one phosphatidylglycerol, two glycolipids, 
      two unidentified phospholipids and three unidentified lipids. Based on 16S rRNA 
      gene analysis, GX 13764(T) presented the highest sequence similarity to 
      Metabacillus mangrovi KCTC 33872(T) (97.04 %). The DNA G+C content of the type 
      strain was 44.2 mol%. The average nucleotide identity values between GX 13764(T) 
      and M. mangrovi KCTC 33872(T), Metabacillus idriensis DSM 19097(T) and 
      Metabacillus indicus LMG 22858(T) were 69.39, 68.87 and 68.95 %, respectively, 
      with digital DNA-DNA hybridization values of 19.9, 19.5 and 19.5 %, respectively. 
      Based on the polyphasic data, strain GX 13764(T) should be nominated as a novel 
      species of the genus Metabacillus, for which the name Metabacillus kandeliae sp. 
      nov. is proposed. The type strain is GX 13764(T) (=MCCC 1K06654(T)=KCTC 
      43366(T)).

TI  - Nitrogen and sulfur fertilizers promote the absorption of lead and cadmium with 
      Salix integra Thunb. by increasing the bioavailability of heavy metals and 
      regulating rhizosphere microbes.

AB  - Fertilization is an effective agronomic strategy to improve the efficiency of 
      phytoextraction by Salix integra Thunb. However, the specific effects of the 
      simultaneous application of nitrogen (N) and sulfur (S) fertilizers in the 
      rhizosphere remain unclear. We investigated the bioavailability of lead (Pb) and 
      Cadmium (Cd) along with the microbial metabolic functions and community structure 
      in the rhizosphere soil of S. integra after the application of N (0, 100, and 
      200 kg.ha(-1).year(-1)) and S (0, 100, and 200 kg.ha(-1).year(-1)) fertilizers 
      for 180 days. The simultaneous application of N and S fertilizers significantly 
      enhanced the absorption of Pb and Cd by S. integra, whereas this effect was not 
      observed for the single application of N or S fertilizer. The contents of 
      acid-soluble Pb and Cd in the rhizosphere soil significantly increased after 
      either single or combined fertilize applications. The microbial metabolic 
      activity was enhanced by the N and S fertilizers, whereas the microbial diversity 
      markedly decreased. The metabolic patterns were mainly affected by the 
      concentration of N fertilizer. The dominant fungi and bacteria were similar under 
      each treatment, although the relative abundances of the dominant and special 
      species differed. Compared to the N200S100 and N200S200 treatments, the N100S100 
      and N100S200 treatments resulted in fewer pathogenic fungi and more rhizosphere 
      growth-promoting bacteria, which promoted phytoremediation by S. integra. 
      Redundancy analysis indicated that the pH and nitrate content were the key 
      factors affecting the structure of the microbial community. Collectively, the 
      results suggest interactive effects between N and S fertilizers on the 
      rhizosphere soil, providing a potential strategy for plant-microbial remediation 
      by S. integra.

AB  - Phosphorus (P) is a nutrient limiting plant growth in subtropical regions. 
      However, our understanding of how soil P responds to an increase in stand age is 
      rather poor. In particular, little is known about how bioavailable P pools 
      (soluble P, exchangeable P, hydrolyzable P, and ligand P) shift with a change in 
      stand age. Moreover, the P cycle in rhizosphere soil has the most direct and 
      significant influence on plants. The aim of the present study was to determine 
      the concentrations of total P in various rhizosphere soil bioavailable P 
      fractions in 5-, 9-, 19-, 29-, and 35-year-old stands of Pinus massoniana Lamb. 
      According to the results, total P (TP) concentration and N:P ratio in rhizosphere 
      soil first decreased, and then increased with an increase in stand age. Soluble P 
      concentration decreased first, and then increased with an increase in stand age; 
      exchangeable P and ligand P decreased first, and then tended to be stable with an 
      increase in stand age, whereas hydrolyzable P increased first, and then 
      decreased. Structural Equation Model results suggested that ligand P and soluble 
      P were the major factor affecting the TP. In addition, soil microorganisms and 
      acid phosphatase-driven hydrolyzable P play a crucial role in soil bioavailable P 
      cycling. Overall, the results of our study provide a mechanistic understanding of 
      soil bioavailable P cycling under low available P conditions, and a basis for an 
      effective P management strategy for the sustainable development of P. massoniana 
      plantations.

TI  - Physiological and biochemical characterization of copper-toxicity tolerance 
      mechanism in grass species native to Pampa Biome and Atlantic Forest for use in 
      phytoremediation.

LID - 10.1007/s11356-022-22570-3 [doi]
AB  - Orchards and vineyards account for significant copper (Cu) accumulation in the 
      soil due to frequent Cu fungicide applications to control leaf diseases. Although 
      grass species are distributed in these areas likely because of their 
      physiological mechanisms to combat Cu toxicity-related stress, the aim of the 
      present study is to identify grass species presenting biochemical-physiological 
      responses that feature adaptive Cu toxicity tolerance mechanisms. Three grass 
      species native to the Pampa and Atlantic Forest biomes (Paspalum notatum, P. 
      plicatulum, and P. urvillei) and an exotic species (Cynodon dactylon) were 
      tested. Plants were cultivated in pots filled with 4 kg of typic Hapludalf soil, 
      under two Cu availability, control, and toxicity conditions (80 mg Cu kg 
      soil(-1)). Photosynthetic parameters, relative growth rate, root dry matter, 
      shoot dry matter, the activity of stress-fighting enzymes (superoxide dismutase 
      and guaiacol peroxidase), root biometry, soluble organic carbon, soil pH, and 
      electrical conductivity were evaluated. P. notatum and P. urvillei have 
      physiological characteristics that allow high translocation factor and Cu 
      accumulation in the root and shoot, and it allows their use in phytoremediation 
      processes due to (1) greater activity of stress-fighting enzymes such as POD in 
      the shoot; (2) to larger diameter roots, which allow greater Cu complexation in 
      them - they are lesser sensitive to stress caused by Cu than the other species; 
      and (3) greater soluble organic carbon exudation in the rhizosphere than species 
      P. plicatulum and C. dactylon, which can complex Cu(2+) and reduce the presence 
      of forms toxic to plants.

AB  - Increasing atmospheric nitrogen (N) deposition has resulted in phosphorus (P) 
      limitation in multiple terrestrial ecosystems, yet how plants coordinate 
      aboveground and belowground strategies to adapt to such P deficiency remains 
      unclear. In this study, we conducted a field N fertilization experiment in two 
      alpine coniferous plantations (Picea asperata Mast. and Pinus armandii Franch.) 
      with different soil N availability on the eastern Tibetan Plateau of China, to 
      examine N addition effects on plant nutrient limiting status and plant adaptive 
      strategies corresponding to aboveground P conservation and belowground P 
      acquisition. The results showed that N addition aggravated P deficiency in both 
      plantations, as indicated by decreased needle P concentrations and increased N:P 
      ratios, and that plant strategies for addressing such P deficiency differed in 
      the two plantations with different initial soil N availabilities. In the P. 
      asperata plantation with relatively high N availability, significantly enhanced 
      needle phosphatase activity and shifts in P fraction allocation (downregulation 
      of the structural P fraction and increased allocation to the residual P fraction) 
      co-occurred with increased rhizosphere effects on phosphatase activity under N 
      addition, indicating a synergistic strategy of aboveground P conservation and 
      belowground P mining to alleviate P deficiency. In the P. armandii plantation 
      with relatively low N availability, however, N addition only enhanced phosphatase 
      activity and increased allocation to residual P fraction in the aboveground but 
      had little effect on belowground P acquisition-associated traits, suggesting a 
      decoupling relationship between aboveground P conservation and belowground P 
      acquisition. This study highlights the vital significance of initial soil 
      nutrient availability in regulating the coordination of aboveground and 
      belowground strategic alternatives, emphasizing the need to integrate soil 
      nutrient conditions for a holistic understanding of forest adaptation to 
      anthropogenic N enrichment.

AB  - Rhizosphere soil microbial communities substantially impact plant growth by 
      regulating the nutrient cycle. However, dynamic changes in soil microbiota under 
      different tree ages have received little attention. In this study, changes in 
      soil physicochemical properties, as well as bacterial diversity and community 
      structures (by high-throughput Illumina MiSeq sequencing), were explored in 
      pomelo trees of different ages (i.e., 10, 20, and 30 years) under red and paddy 
      soils cultivated by farmers with high fertilizer input. Moreover, soil factors 
      that shape the bacterial community, such as soil pH, AP (available phosphorous), 
      AK (available potassium), and AN (available nitrogen), were also investigated. 
      Results showed that pH significantly decreased, while AP, AK, and AN increased 
      with increasing tree age under red soil. For paddy soil, pH was not changed, 
      while AP was significantly lower under 10-year-old pomelo trees, and AK and AN 
      contents were minimum under 30-year-old pomelo trees. Both soil types were 
      dominated by Proteobacteria, Acidobacteria, and Actinobacteria and showed 
      contrasting patterns of relative abundance under different tree age groups. 
      Bacterial richness and diversity decreased with increasing tree age in both soil 
      types. Overall, bacterial community composition was different under different 
      tree ages. RDA analysis showed that soil pH, AP, and AN in red soil, and pH and 
      AP in paddy soil showed the most significant effects in changing the bacterial 
      community structure. A random forest model showed Sinomonas and Streptacidiphilus 
      in red soil, while Actinoallomurus and Microbacterium in paddy soil were the most 
      important genera explaining the differences among different age groups. The 
      ternary plot further revealed that genera enrichment for Age_30 was higher than 
      that for Age_10 and Age_20 in red soil, whereas specific genera enrichment 
      decreased with increasing tree age under paddy soil. Co-occurrence network 
      revealed that bacterial species formed a complex network structure with 
      increasing tree age, indicating a more stable microbial association under 20 and 
      30 years than 10-year-old pomelo trees. Hence, contrasting patterns of changes in 
      soil physicochemical properties and soil microbial communities were recorded 
      under different tree ages, and tree ages significantly affected the bacterial 
      community structure and richness. These findings provide valuable information 
      regarding the importance of microbes for the sustainable management of pomelo 
      orchards by optimizing fertilizer input for different ages of trees.

AB  - The rhizosphere is a hotspot for denitrification. The nitrous oxide (N2O) 
      reductase among denitrifiers and nondenitrifying N2O reducers is the only known 
      N2O sink in the biosphere. We hypothesized that the composition of 
      root-associated N2O-reducing communities when establishing on annual crops depend 
      on soil type and plant species, but that assembly processes are independent of 
      these factors and differ between nosZ clades I and II. Using a pot experiment 
      with barley and sunflower and two soils, we analyzed the abundance, composition, 
      and diversity of soil and root-associated N2O reducing communities by qPCR and 
      amplicon sequencing of nosZ. Clade I was more abundant on roots compared to soil, 
      while clade II showed the opposite. In barley, this pattern coincided with N2O 
      availability, determined as potential N2O production rates, but for sunflower no 
      N2O production was detected in the root compartment. Root and soil nosZ 
      communities differed in composition and phylogeny-based community analyses 
      indicated that assembly of root-associated N2O reducers was driven by the 
      interaction between plant and soil type, with inferred competition being more 
      influential than habitat selection. Selection between clades I and II in the 
      root/soil interface is suggested, which may have functional consequences since 
      most clade I microorganisms can produce N2O.

AB  - Consequences of interactions between ectomycorrhizal fungi (EcMF) and 
      non-mycorrhizal rhizosphere fungi (NMRF) for plant carbon (C) allocation 
      belowground and nutrient cycling in soil remain unknown. To address this topic, 
      we performed a mesocosm study with Norway spruce seedlings [Picea abies (L.) H. 
      Karst] inoculated with EcMF, NMRF, or a mixture of both (MIX). (14) CO(2) pulse 
      labelling of spruce was applied to trace and visualize the (14) C incorporation 
      into roots, rhizohyphosphere and hyphosphere. Activities and localization of 
      enzymes involved in the C, nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) cycling were 
      visualized using zymography. Spruce seedlings inoculated with EcMF and NMRF 
      allocated more C to soils (EcMF: 10.7%; NMRF: 3.5% of total recovered C) compared 
      to uninoculated control seedlings. The (14) C activity in the hyphosphere was 
      highest for EcMF and lowest for NMRF. In the presence of both, NMRF and EcMF 
      (MIX), the (14) C activity was 64% lower compared with EcMF inoculation alone. 
      This suggests a suppressed C allocation via EcMF likely due to the competition 
      between EcMF and NMRF for N and P. Furthermore, we observed 57% and 49% higher 
      chitinase and leucine-aminopeptidase activities in the rhizohyphosphere of EcMF 
      compared to the uninoculated control, respectively. In contrast, beta-glucosidase 
      activity (14.3 nmol cm(-2)  h(-1) ) was highest in NMRF likely because NMRF 
      consumed rhizodeposits efficiently. This was further supported by that enzyme 
      stoichiometry in soil with EcMF shifted to a higher investment of nutrient 
      acquisition enzymes (e.g., chitinase, leucine-aminopeptidase, acid phosphatase) 
      compared to NMRF inoculation, where investment in beta-glucosidase increased. In 
      conclusion, the alleviation of EcMF from C limitation promotes higher activities 
      of enzymes involved in the N and P cycle to cover the nutrient demand of EcMF and 
      host seedlings. In contrast, C limitation of NMRF probably led to a shift in 
      investment towards higher activities of enzymes involved in the C cycle.

TI  - Eco-Stoichiometric Characteristics of Rhizosphere and Bulk Soils of Smilax china 
      L. along Vertical Zone Spectrum of Fanjing Mountain.

AB  - To explore the correlations between nutrients and stoichiometric characteristics 
      in the rhizosphere and bulk soils of understory Smilax china L. in forest 
      ecosystems at different altitudes and to clarify the rhizosphere effect of 
      understory vegetation in forest ecosystems and its response strategy to altitude, 
      providing a theoretical basis for better forest ecological environment protection 
      and high-quality development in Fanjing Mountain. Understory Smilax china L. at 
      four different altitudes were selected, with the differences and influencing 
      factors of carbon (C), nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P) and potassium (K) mass 
      fractions and stoichiometric ratios in their rhizosphere and bulk soils analyzed. 
      The average mass fractions of total C, total N and alkali-hydrolyzed N in the 
      rhizosphere and bulk soils of Smilax china L. at different altitudes were 224.43 
      and 181.55 g.kg(-1); 9.56 and 6.81 g.kg(-1); and 648.19 and 600.70 g.kg(-1), 
      respectively. The rhizosphere effect of Smilax china L. was significant at 
      altitudes of 500 m and 1000 m but became not so prominent with the rise of 
      altitude. The C:N ratio in the rhizosphere and bulk soils ranged from 19.51 to 
      39.75 and the C:P ratio ranged from 225.29 to 543.05. C accumulation is greater 
      than N accumulation in the rhizosphere and bulk soils of Smilax china L., and 
      both present P limitation. Based on the comprehensive analysis of the mass 
      fractions and eco-stoichiometric ratios of soil nutrients, the P limitation in 
      Fanjing Mountain forest ecosystem is commonly seen and should be addressed.

TI  - Beneficial and pathogenic plant-microbe interactions during flooding stress.
PG  - 2875-2897
LID - 10.1111/pce.14403 [doi]
AB  - The number and intensity of flood events will likely increase in the future, 
      raising the risk of flooding stress in terrestrial plants. Understanding flood 
      effects on plant physiology and plant-associated microbes is key to alleviate 
      flooding stress in sensitive species and ecosystems. Reduced oxygen supply is the 
      main constrain to the plant and its associated microbiome. Hypoxic conditions 
      hamper root aerobic respiration and, consequently, hydraulic conductance, 
      nutrient uptake, and plant growth and development. Hypoxia favours the presence 
      of anaerobic microbes in the rhizosphere and roots with potential negative 
      effects to the plant due to their pathogenic behaviour or their soil 
      denitrification ability. Moreover, plant physiological and metabolic changes 
      induced by flooding stress may also cause dysbiotic changes in endosphere and 
      rhizosphere microbial composition. The negative effects of flooding stress on the 
      holobiont (i.e., the host plant and its associated microbiome) can be mitigated 
      once the plant displays adaptive responses to increase oxygen uptake. Stress 
      relief could also arise from the positive effect of certain beneficial microbes, 
      such as mycorrhiza or dark septate endophytes. More research is needed to explore 
      the spiralling, feedback flood responses of plant and microbes if we want to 
      promote plant flood tolerance from a holobiont perspective.

AB  - Deciphering the relationships between microbes and their host plants is critical 
      for a better understanding of microbial diversity maintenance and community 
      stability. Here, we investigated fungal diversity and community assembly in the 
      phyllosphere and rhizosphere of 13 tree species in a subtropical common-garden 
      experiment. The results showed that fungal community structures significantly 
      differed across compartments (leaf, root, and soil) and different tree species. 
      Higher alpha-diversity was observed in the phyllosphere than in the roots and 
      rhizospheric soil. Fungal community composition (beta-diversity) was significantly 
      affected by both compartment and species identity. The fungal community 
      compositions were significantly correlated with soil pH in the roots and the 
      soils as well as with soil nitrate and leaf total phosphorus in the leaves. We 
      found that fungal community assemblies were mainly driven by deterministic 
      processes, regardless of compartments. Moreover, host preference analyses 
      indicated that stronger plant/fungus preferences occurred in leaves than in roots 
      and soils. Our results highlight the differences in tree mycobiome between 
      aboveground and belowground compartments and have important implications for the 
      promotion of biodiversity conservation and management sustainability for the 
      subtropical forest. IMPORTANCE Subtropical mountain forests are widely 
      distributed in Southern China and are characterized by high biodiversity. The 
      interactions between plants and fungi play pivotal roles in biodiversity 
      maintenance and community stability. Nevertheless, knowledge of fungal diversity 
      and of the community assembly patterns of woody plants is scarce. Here, we 
      investigated fungal diversity and community assembly in the phyllosphere and 
      rhizosphere of 13 tree species in a common-garden experiment. We found that both 
      compartment and plant identity influenced fungal diversity, community, and guild 
      compositions, while deterministic processes mainly governed the fungal community 
      assembly, especially in the rhizospheric fungal communities. Our results 
      demonstrate that tree leaves represent stronger host/fungi preferences than do 
      roots and soils. Together, our findings enhance the understanding of the roles of 
      compartment and plant identity in structuring fungal communities as well as 
      promote fungal diversity maintenance in subtropical mountain forest ecosystems.

AB  - Wetwood disease of poplar limits the processing and manufacturing of poplar, and 
      the pathogenic bacteria of wet heartwood are poorly known. We used 
      high-throughput sequencing methods to analyze the bacterial community of the 
      heartwood, sapwood, root tissue, and rhizosphere soil of Populus x euramericana 
      cv. "74/76" (poplar 107) in wetwood trees and healthy trees to explore the cause 
      of poplar wetwood disease. Bacterial diversity and community structure were 
      analyzed, and the correlation between wood properties and bacterial relative 
      abundance was analyzed to explore their relationship. Two alpha-diversity indices 
      of endophytic bacteria in the heartwood of wetwood trees were significantly 
      (p < 0.05) lower than that in the heartwood of healthy trees, and the community 
      structure between the two types of trees was significantly different. No 
      significant differences in the alpha-diversity indices nor community structure 
      were observed in the sapwood, root tissue, or rhizosphere bacterial community of 
      diseased and healthy trees. The distribution of dominant bacteria genus in the 
      heartwood of diseased and healthy trees differed. Proteiniphilum, Actinotalea, 
      and Methanobacterium were the dominant genera in diseased trees' heartwood. 
      Proteiniphilum, Dysgonomonas, and Bacteroides were the dominant genera in healthy 
      trees' heartwood. The relative abundance of Proteiniphilum, Actinotalea, and 
      Methanobacterium was significantly higher in the heartwood of wetwood trees than 
      those of healthy trees. A db-RDA analysis found that these three bacterial genera 
      were positively correlated with the rate of wet heartwood. These three bacterial 
      genera may be the main pathogens causing poplar wetwood disease.

TI  - A dynamic rhizosphere interplay between tree roots and soil bacteria under 
      drought stress.
LID - 10.7554/eLife.79679 [doi]
LID - e79679
AB  - Root exudates are thought to play an important role in plant-microbial 
      interactions. In return for nutrition, soil bacteria can increase the 
      bioavailability of soil nutrients. However, root exudates typically decrease in 
      situations such as drought, calling into question the efficacy of solvation and 
      bacteria-dependent mineral uptake in such stress. Here, we tested the hypothesis 
      of exudate-driven microbial priming on Cupressus saplings grown in forest soil in 
      custom-made rhizotron boxes. A 1-month imposed drought and concomitant 
      inoculations with a mix of Bacillus subtilis and Pseudomonas stutzeri, bacteria 
      species isolated from the forest soil, were applied using factorial design. 
      Direct bacteria counts and visualization by confocal microscopy showed that both 
      bacteria associated with Cupressus roots. Interestingly, root exudation rates 
      increased 2.3-fold with bacteria under drought, as well as irrigation. Forty-four 
      metabolites in exudates were significantly different in concentration between 
      irrigated and drought trees, including phenolic acid compounds and quinate. When 
      adding these metabolites as carbon and nitrogen sources to bacterial cultures of 
      both bacterial species, eight of nine metabolites stimulated bacterial growth. 
      Importantly, soil phosphorous bioavailability was maintained only in inoculated 
      trees, mitigating drought-induced decrease in leaf phosphorus and iron. Our 
      observations of increased root exudation rate when drought and inoculation 
      regimes were combined support the idea of root recruitment of beneficial 
      bacteria, especially under water stress.

OAB - The soil surrounding the roots of trees, termed the rhizosphere, is full of 
      bacteria and other communities of microorganisms. Trees secrete organic compounds 
      in to the soil which are thought to influence the behavior of bacteria in the 
      rhizosphere. Specifically, these root secretions, or 'exudates', attract and feed 
      soil bacteria, which, in return, release nutrients that benefit the tree. In 
      2020, a group of researchers found that some trees in the Mediterranean forest 
      produce more exudates during the long dry season. This suggests that the 
      compounds secreted by roots may help trees to tolerate stress conditions, such as 
      drought. To test this hypothesis, Oppenheimer-Shaanan et al. - including some of 
      the researchers involved in the 2020 study - grew young Cupressus sempervirens 
      conifer trees in drought conditions that starved them of the nutrients 
      phosphorous and iron. Each tree was planted in a custom-built box which allowed 
      easy access to roots growing in the soil. Two species of bacteria from the forest 
      soil C. sempervirens trees naturally live in were then added to the soil in each 
      box. Microscopy revealed that both species of bacteria, which had been tagged 
      with fluorescent markers, were attracted to the roots of the trees, boosting the 
      bacterial community in the rhizosphere. Oppenheimer-Shaanan et al. found that the 
      recruitment of the two bacterial species caused the rate at which exudates were 
      secreted from the roots to increase. Compounds in the exudate stimulated the 
      bacteria to grow. Ultimately, levels of phosphorous and iron in the leaves of the 
      starved trees increased when in the presence of these soil bacteria. This 
      suggests that bacteria in the rhizosphere helps trees to survive when they are 
      under stress and have low levels of water. These findings provide further 
      evidence that plants and bacteria can live together in symbiosis and benefit one 
      another. This could have important implications for forest ecology and 
      potentially how trees are grown in orchards and gardens. For example, specific 
      bacteria and organic compounds in the rhizosphere may be able to improve tree 
      health. However, further work is needed to investigate whether the exudate 
      compounds identified in this study are found more widely in nature.

AB  - Understanding microbial communities associated with bulk and rhizosphere soils 
      will benefit the maintenance of forest health and productivity and the 
      sustainable development of forest ecosystems. Based on MiSeq sequencing, we 
      explored the differences between the bulk soil and the rhizosphere soil on 
      bacterial and fungal communities of pecan plantation. Results suggested that 
      rhizosphere-associated fungal rather than bacterial community structures differed 
      from bulk soil, and rhizosphere soil had lower fungal diversity than bulk soil. 
      Actinobacteria and Cantharellales were the bacterial and fungal biomarkers of the 
      rhizosphere soil of pecan plantation, respectively. In addition, Pleosporales, 
      which are mainly involved in saprophylaxis and plant pathogenic processes, was 
      identified as one of the most important fungal biomarkers for the bulk soil, and 
      the FunGuild predicted a higher relative abundance of pathogenic fungi in bulk 
      soil compared to rhizosphere soil. The pH, ammonium nitrogen ( NH4+ -N), nitrate 
      nitrogen ( NO3- -N), and total carbon (TC) contents drove microbial community 
      structure and composition. The bacterial network was simpler in the rhizosphere 
      soil than in the bulk soil. However, fungi showed the opposite network pattern. 
      Keystone species in bacterial and fungal networks were mostly involved in 
      nutrient cycling and the C cycling, and were found to be enriched in the 
      rhizosphere soil. Overall, in terms of bacterial and fungal communities, the 
      rhizosphere soil behaves more healthily than the bulk soil and has a higher 
      potential for nutrient cycling.

AB  - Deciduous and evergreen trees differ in their responses to drought and nitrogen 
      (N) demand. Whether or not these functional types affect the role of the 
      bacterial community in the N cycle during drought remains uncertain. Two 
      deciduous tree species (Alnus cremastogyne, an N(2)-fixing species, and 
      Liquidambar formosana) and two evergreen trees (Cunninghamia lanceolata and Pinus 
      massoniana) were used to assess factors in controlling rhizosphere soil bacterial 
      community and N cycling functions. Photosynthetic rates and biomass production of 
      plants, 16S rRNA sequencing and N-cycling-related genes of rhizosphere soil were 
      measured. The relative abundance of the phyla Actinobacteria and Firmicutes was 
      higher, and that of Proteobacteria, Acidobacteria, and Gemmatimondaetes was lower 
      in rhizosphere soil of deciduous trees than that of evergreen. Beta-diversity of 
      bacterial community also significantly differed between the two types of trees. 
      Deciduous trees showed significantly higher net photosynthetic rates and biomass 
      production than evergreen species both at well water condition and short-term 
      drought. Root biomass was the most important factor in driving soil bacterial 
      community and N-cycling functions than total biomass and aboveground biomass. 
      Furthermore, 44 bacteria genera with a decreasing response and 46 taxa showed an 
      increased response along the root biomass gradient. Regarding N-cycle-related 
      functional genes, copy numbers of ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AOB) and 
      autotrophic ammonia-oxidizing archaea (AOA), N(2) fixation gene (nifH), and 
      denitrification genes (nirK, nirS) were significantly higher in the soil of 
      deciduous trees than in that of the evergreen. Structural equation models 
      explained 50.2%, 47.6%, 48.6%, 49.4%, and 37.3% of the variability in copy 
      numbers of nifH, AOB, AOA, nirK, and nirS, respectively, and revealed that root 
      biomass had significant positive effects on copy numbers of all N-cycle 
      functional genes. In conclusion, root biomass played key roles in affecting 
      bacterial community structure and soil N cycling. Our findings have important 
      implications for our understanding of plants control over bacterial community and 
      N-cycling function in artificial forest ecosystems.

TI  - Plant-microbial responses to reduced precipitation depend on tree species in a 
      temperate forest.
PG  - 5820-5830
LID - 10.1111/gcb.16340 [doi]
AB  - Given that global change is predicted to increase the frequency and severity of 
      drought in temperate forests, it is critical to understand the degree to which 
      plant belowground responses cascade through the soil system to drive ecosystem 
      responses to water stress. While most research has focused on plant and microbial 
      responses independently of each other, a gap in our understanding lies in the 
      integrated response of plant-microbial interactions to water stress. We 
      investigated the extent to which divergent belowground responses to reduced 
      precipitation between sugar maple trees (Acer saccharum) versus oak trees (Oak 
      spp.) may influence microbial activity via throughfall exclusion in the field. 
      Evidence that oak trees send carbon belowground to prime microbial activity more 
      than maples under ambient conditions and in response to water stress suggests 
      there is the potential for corresponding impacts of reduced precipitation on 
      microbial activity. As such, we tested the hypothesis that differences in 
      belowground C allocation between oaks and maples would stimulate microbial 
      activity in the oak treatment soils and reduce microbial activity in in the sugar 
      maple treatment soils compared to their respective controls. We found that the 
      treatment led to declines in N mineralization, soil respiration, and oxidative 
      enzyme activity in the sugar maple treatment plot. These declines may be due to 
      sugar maple trees reducing root C transfers to the soil. By contrast, the reduced 
      precipitation treatment enhanced soil respiration, as well as rates of N 
      mineralization and peroxidase activity in the oak rhizosphere. This enhanced 
      activity suggests that oak roots provided optimal rhizosphere conditions during 
      water stress to prime microbial activity to support net primary production. With 
      future changes in precipitation predicted for forests in the Eastern US, we show 
      that the strength of plant-microbial interactions drives the degree to which 
      reduced precipitation impacts soil C and nutrient cycling.

AB  - Microbial-driven processes related to the nitrogen-metabolism (N-metabolism) in 
      soil are critical for ecosystem functioning and stability. There are spatial 
      patterns of microbial-mediated nitrogen processes, but we still lack an overview 
      of the soil N-metabolism genes of single nitrogen-fixing tree species pure 
      forests at a regional scale. Here, we investigated the spatial variation and 
      drivers of microbial N-metabolism genes in the rhizosphere soil of Robinia 
      pseudoacacia on the Loess Plateau by metagenomic technology. We found that the 
      distance-decay of soil N functional gene similarities in Robinia pseudoacacia 
      forests on the Loess Plateau spanning a geographic distance of 230 km was 
      significant (p < 0.001). The gene composition and co-occurrence patterns in the 
      process of soil microbial N-metabolism were very different, and they were mainly 
      driven by soil pH and MAP (mean annual precipitation). The proportion of positive 
      links and edges co-occurrence networks between N functional genes increased with 
      increasing pH, suggesting that increasing pH promoted connections between 
      functional genes. The relative frequencies of N-metabolism pathways were 
      consistent on the Loess Plateau, the abundance of ammonia assimilation pathway 
      was highest, and the abundance of the nitrogen fixation pathway was the lowest; 
      only the abundance of the nitrogen fixation pathway was not significantly 
      different. The bacterial and archaeal communities involved in soil nitrogen 
      metabolism were significantly different. Structural equation modeling showed that 
      decreases in soil pH and MAP mainly affected the increase in nitrogen functional 
      gene abundance through an increase in the diversity of N-metabolism 
      microorganisms. In conclusion, this study provides a baseline for biogeographic 
      studies of soil microbe functional genes.

TI  - Belowground Carbon Efficiency for Nitrogen and Phosphorus Acquisition Varies 
      Between Lolium perenne and Trifolium repens and Depends on Phosphorus 
      Fertilization.

AB  - Photosynthetically derived carbon (C) is allocated belowground, allowing plants 
      to obtain nutrients. However, less is known about the amount of nutrients 
      acquired relative to the C allocated belowground, which is referred to as C 
      efficiency for nutrient acquisition (CENA). Here, we examined how C efficiency 
      for nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) acquisition varied between ryegrass (Lolium 
      perenne) and clover (Trifolium repens) with and without P fertilization. A 
      continuous (13)C-labeling method was applied to track belowground C allocation. 
      Both species allocated nearly half of belowground C to rhizosphere respiration 
      (49%), followed by root biomass (37%), and rhizodeposition (14%). With regard to 
      N and P, CENA was higher for clover than for ryegrass, which remained higher 
      after accounting for relatively low C costs associated with biological N(2) 
      fixation. Phosphorus fertilization increased the C efficiency for P acquisition 
      but decreased the C efficiency for N acquisition. A higher CENA for N and P in 
      clover may be attributed to the greater rhizosphere priming on soil organic 
      matter decomposition. Increased P availability with P fertilization could induce 
      lower C allocation for P uptake but exacerbate soil N limitation, thereby making 
      N uptake less C efficient. Overall, our study revealed that species-specific 
      belowground C allocation and nutrient uptake efficiency depend on which nutrient 
      is limited.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: A broad spectrum of rhizosphere bacteria and fungi were shown to 
      play a central role for health, fitness and productivity of their host plants. 
      However, implications of host metabolism on microbiota assembly in the 
      phyllosphere and potential consequences for holobiont functioning were sparsely 
      addressed. Previous observations indicated that tea plants might reduce disease 
      occurrence in various forests located in their proximity; the underlying 
      mechanisms and potential implications of the phyllosphere microbiota remained 
      elusive. OBJECTIVES: This study aimed atdeciphering microbiome assembly in the 
      tea plant phyllosphere throughout shoot development as well as elucidating 
      potential implications of host metabolites in this process. The main focus was to 
      explore hidden interconnections between the homeostasis of the phyllosphere 
      microbiome and resistance to fungal pathogens. METHODS: Profiling of host 
      metabolites and microbiome analyses based on high-throughput sequencing were 
      integrated to identify drivers of microbiome assembly throughout shoot 
      development in the phyllosphere of tea plants. This was complemented by tracking 
      of beneficial microorganisms in all compartments of the plant. Synthetic 
      assemblages (SynAss), bioassays and field surveys were implemented to verify 
      functioning of the phyllosphere microbiota. RESULTS: Theophylline and 
      epigallocatechin gallate, two prevalent metabolites at the early and late shoot 
      development stage respectively, were identified as the main drivers of microbial 
      community assembly. Flavobacterium and Myriangium were distinct microbial 
      responders at the early stage, while Parabacteroides and Mortierella were more 
      enriched at the late stage. Reconstructed, stage-specific SynAss suppressed 
      various tree phytopathogens by 13.0%-69.3% in vitro and reduced disease incidence 
      by 8.24%-41.3% in vivo. CONCLUSION: The findings indicate that a functional 
      phyllosphere microbiota was assembled along with development-specific metabolites 
      in tea plants, which continuously suppressed prevalent fungal pathogens. The 
      insights gained into the temporally resolved metabolite response of the tea plant 
      microbiota could provide novel solutions for disease management.

AB  - The rhizosphere, the region of soil surrounding roots of plants, is colonized by 
      a unique population of Plant Growth Promoting Rhizobacteria (PGPR). Many 
      important PGPR as well as plant pathogens belong to the genus Pseudomonas. There 
      is, however, uncertainty on the divide between beneficial and pathogenic strains 
      as previously thought to be signifying genomic features have limited power to 
      separate these strains. Here we used the Genome properties (GP) common biological 
      pathways annotation system and Machine Learning (ML) to establish the 
      relationship between the genome wide GP composition and the plant-associated 
      lifestyle of 91 Pseudomonas strains isolated from the rhizosphere and the 
      phyllosphere representing both plant-associated phenotypes. GP enrichment 
      analysis, Random Forest model fitting and feature selection revealed 28 
      discriminating features. A test set of 75 new strains confirmed the importance of 
      the selected features for classification. The results suggest that GP annotations 
      provide a promising computational tool to better classify the plant-associated 
      lifestyle.

AB  - Soil phosphorus (P) availability is critical to plant productivity in many 
      terrestrial ecosystems. How soil P availability responds to changes in plant 
      diversity remains uncertain, despite the global crisis of rapid biodiversity 
      loss. Our meta-analysis based on 180 studies across various ecosystems 
      (croplands, grasslands, forests and pot experiments) shows that, on average, soil 
      total P, phosphatase activity and available P are 6.8%, 8.5% and 4.6%, 
      respectively, higher in species mixtures than in monocultures. The mixture effect 
      on phosphatase activity becomes more positive with increasing species and 
      functional group richness, with more pronounced increases in the rhizosphere than 
      in the bulk soil. The mixture effects on soil-available P in the bulk soil do not 
      change, but with increasing species or functional group richness these effects in 
      the rhizosphere soil shift from positive to negative. Nonetheless, enhanced soil 
      phosphatase activity stimulated available P in diverse species mixtures, 
      offsetting increased plant uptake effects that decrease soil-available P. 
      Moreover, the enhancement effects of species richness on soil phosphatase 
      activity are positively associated with increased plant productivity. Our 
      findings highlight that preserving plant diversity could increase soil 
      phosphatase activity and P availability, which sustain the current and future 
      productivity of terrestrial ecosystems.

AB  - The soil microbiome is crucial for improving the services and functioning of 
      agroecosystems. Numerous studies have demonstrated the potential of soil 
      physical-chemical properties in driving the belowground microbial assemblages in 
      different agroecosystems. However, not much is known about the assemblage of 
      bacteria and fungi in response to soil physical-chemical properties and the 
      surrounding landscape composition in different vegetable fields of a highly 
      intensive agricultural system. Here, we investigated the effects of soil 
      physical-chemical properties and landscape composition on the community trends of 
      bacteria and fungi in two different soil compartments (bulk and rhizospheric 
      soils) of two different brassica crop types (Chinese cabbage and flower cabbage). 
      The results revealed that bulk soil had a higher alpha diversity of both bacteria 
      and fungi than rhizospheric soil. Each of the soil physical-chemical properties 
      and landscape compositions contributed differently to driving the community 
      structure of distinct bacterial and fungal taxa in both soil compartments and 
      crop types. The higher proportions of forest, grassland, and cultivated land, 
      along with the higher amount of soil calcium in flower cabbage fields, promote 
      the assemblage of Gammaproteobacteria, Actinobacteria, Oxyophotobacteria, 
      Agaricomycetes, and Eurotiomycetes. On the other hand, in Chinese cabbage fields, 
      the increased amounts of iron, zinc, and manganese in the soil together with 
      higher proportions of non-brassica crops in the surrounding landscape strongly 
      support the assemblage of Deltaproteobacteria, Gemmatimonadetes, Bacilli, 
      Clostridia, Alphaproteobacteria, an unknown bacterial species Subgroup-6, 
      Mortierellomycetes, Rhizophlyctidomycetes, and Chytridiomycetes. The findings of 
      this study provide the most comprehensive, comparative, and novel insights 
      related to the bacterial and fungal responses in a highly intensive vegetable 
      growing system for the improvement of the soil fertility and structure. These are 
      important clues for the identification of key bacteria and fungi contributing to 
      the plant-environment interactions and are of a practical significance for

AB  - The rhizosphere of ginseng contains a wide range of microorganisms that can have 
      beneficial or harmful effects on the plant. Root exudates of ginseng, 
      particularly ginsenosides and phenolic acids, appear to select for particular 
      microbial populations through their stimulatory and inhibitory activities, which 
      may account for the similarities between the rhizosphere microbiomes of different 
      cultivated species of Panax. Many practices of cultivation attempt to mimic the 
      natural conditions of ginseng as an understory plant in hilly forested areas. 
      However, these practices are often disruptive to soil, and thus the soil 
      microbiome differs between wild and cultivated ginseng. Changes in the microbiome 
      during cultivation can be harmful as they have been associated with negative 
      changes of the soil physiochemistry as well as the promotion of plant diseases. 
      However, isolation of a number of beneficial microbes from the ginseng 
      rhizosphere indicates that many have the potential to improve ginseng production. 
      The application of high-throughput sequencing to study the rhizosphere microbiome 
      of ginseng grown under a variety of conditions continues to greatly expand our 
      knowledge of the diversity and abundance of those organisms as well as their 
      impacts of cultivation. While there is much more to be learnt, many aspects of 
      the ginseng rhizosphere microbiome have already been revealed.

TI  - Changes in Rhizosphere Soil Fungal Communities of Pinus tabuliformis Plantations 
      at Different Development Stages on the Loess Plateau.
LID - 10.3390/ijms23126753 [doi]
LID - 6753
AB  - The soil fungal community is an important factor in the forest ecosystems, and a 
      better understanding of its composition and dynamic changes will contribute to 
      the maintenance, preservation, and sustainable development of the forest 
      ecosystems. Pinus tabuliformis has been widely planted for local ecological 
      restoration on the Loess Plateau in China in recent decades. However, these 
      plantations have been degraded to different degrees with increasing stand age. 
      Hence, we tried to find the possible causes for the plantation degradation by 
      analyzing soil environmental changes and soil fungal community composition at 
      different stand ages. We collected rhizosphere soil samples from young 
      (10-year-old), middle-aged (20-year-old), and near-mature (30-year-old) P. 
      tabuliformis plantations in this region and characterized their soil properties 
      and soil fungal community diversity and composition. Our results showed that with 
      increasing stand age, the contents of organic carbon, ammonium nitrogen (AN) and 
      nitrate nitrogen (NN) in the soil increased significantly, while the content of 
      available phosphorus (AP) decreased significantly. The main factors affecting the 
      composition of the soil fungal community were the contents of AP, AN, and NN in 
      the soil. In addition, the genus Suillus was the dominant ectomycorrhizal (ECM) 
      fungus in all periods of P. tabuliformis plantations in this region. The results 
      of structural equation modeling showed that the community composition of ECM 
      fungi was significantly correlated with stand age, soil NN, and AP contents, and 
      that of pathogenic (PAG) fungi was significantly correlated with soil AN and AP 
      contents. The decrease in the relative abundance of ECM fungi and the increase in 
      the relative abundance of PAG fungi would exacerbate the degradation of P. 
      tabulaeformis plantation. Our results illustrated that the content of soil AP is 
      not only an important factor limiting the development of plantations, but it also 
      significantly affects the community composition of soil fungi in the rhizosphere 
      of the P. tabuliformis plantation. This study provides a novel insight into the 
      degradation of P. tabuliformis plantations and builds a solid foundation for 
      their subsequent management, restoration, and sustainable development on the 
      Loess Plateau of China.

TI  - Organic and Conventional Bean Pesticides in Development of Autochthonous 
      Trichoderma Strains.
LID - 10.3390/jof8060603 [doi]
LID - 603
AB  - Pesticides of chemical synthesis have mainly been used to control pests, diseases 
      and adventitious plants up until now. However, it has been shown that some 
      pesticides can remain in the soil for long periods of time, thus affecting the 
      development of organisms in the rhizosphere as well as human health, which are 
      two of the most noteworthy side effects. The aim of this research was to analyze 
      the compatibility of autochthonous Trichoderma strains with different synthetic 
      fungicides, acaricides, insecticides (including an entomopathogenic fungus) and 
      herbicides. Sulfur encouraged the growth of all autochthonous strains assayed, 
      and the combination Trichoderma-B. bassiana did not disturb their growth. So, the 
      combination of the autochthonous Trichoderma strains with these organic 
      pesticides will be a positive strategy to apply in the field to control pests and 
      some diseases. Conventional pesticides modified the development of all 
      autochthonous Trichoderma strains, demonstrating that not only do they affect 
      weeds, fungus or pests but also rhizosphere microorganisms. In conclusion, 
      conventional pesticides indiscriminately used to control pests, diseases and 
      weeds could reduce the development of autochthonous Trichoderma strains, 
      especially fungicides and herbicides.

AB  - AIMS: Despite little soil development and organic matter accumulation, lodgepole 
      pine (Pinus contorta var. latifolia) consistently shows vigorous growth on bare 
      gravel substrate of aggregate mining pits in parts of Canadian sub-boreal 
      forests. This study aimed to investigate the bacterial microbiome of lodgepole 
      pine trees growing at an unreclaimed gravel pit in central British Columbia and 
      suggest their potential role in tree growth and survival following mining 
      activity. METHODS: We characterized the diversity, taxonomic composition, and 
      relative abundance of bacterial communities in rhizosphere and endosphere niches 
      of pine trees regenerating at the gravel pit along with comparing them with a 
      nearby undisturbed forested site using 16S rRNA high-throughput sequencing. 
      Additionally, the soil and plant nutrient contents at both sites were also 
      analyzed. RESULTS: Although soil N-content at the gravel pit was drastically 
      lower than the forest site, pine tissue N-levels at both sites were identical. 
      Beta-diversity was affected by site and niche-type, signifying that the diversity 
      of bacterial communities harboured by pine trees was different between both sites 
      and among various plant-niches. Bacterial alpha-diversity was comparable at both 
      sites but differed significantly between belowground and aboveground 
      plant-niches. In terms of composition, pine trees predominantly associated with 
      taxa that appear plant-beneficial including phylotypes of Rhizobiaceae, 
      Acetobacteraceae, and Beijerinckiaceae at the gravel pit and Xanthobacteraceae, 
      Acetobacteraceae, Beijerinckiaceae and Acidobacteriaceae at the forest site. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that, following mining activity, regenerating 
      pine trees recruit bacterial communities that could be plant-beneficial and 
      support pine growth in an otherwise severely N-limited disturbed environment.

AB  - Plant and root fungal interactions are among the most important belowground 
      ecological interactions, however, the mechanisms underlying pairwise interactions 
      and network patterns of rhizosphere fungi and host plants remain unknown. We 
      tested whether neutral process or spatial constraints individually or jointly 
      best explained quantitative plant-ectomycorrhizal fungal network assembly in a 
      subtropical forest in southern China. Results showed that the observed 
      plant-ectomycorrhizal fungal network had low connectivity, high interaction 
      evenness, and an intermediate level of specialization, with nestedness and 
      modularity both greater than random expectation. Incorporating information on the 
      relative abundance and spatial overlap of plants and fungi well predicted network 
      nestedness and connectance, but not necessarily explained other network metrics 
      such as specificity. Spatial overlap better predicted pairwise species 
      interactions of plants and ectomycorrhizal fungi than species abundance or a 
      combination of species abundance and spatial overlap. There was a significant 
      phylogenetic signal on species degree and interaction strength for 
      ectomycorrhizal fungal but not for plant species. Our study suggests that neutral 
      processes (species abundance matching) and niche/dispersal-related processes 
      (implied by spatial overlap and phylogeny) jointly drive the shaping of a 
      plant-ectomycorrhizal fungal network.

AB  - Long-term continuous cropping of soybean can generate the development of 
      disease-suppressive soils. However, whether the changes in microbial communities, 
      especially for archaea, contribute to controlling soil sickness and improving 
      crop yields remains poorly understood. Here, real-time PCR and high-throughput 
      sequencing were employed to investigate the changes in soil archaeal communities 
      in both bulk and rhizosphere soils under four cropping systems, including the 
      continuous cropping of soybeans for a short-term of 3 and 5 years (CC3 and CC5, 
      respectively) and for a long-term of 13 years (CC13), as well as a soybean-maize 
      rotation for 5 years (CR5). The results showed that CC13 and CR5 significantly 
      increased archaeal abundance, reduced the alpha-diversity of archaeal 
      communities, and changed soil archaeal community structures compared to CC3 and 
      CC5. Microbial co-occurrence network analysis revealed that CC13 led to the 
      higher resistant microbial community and lower the relative abundance of 
      potential plant pathogens in the network compared to CC3 and CC5. Correlation 
      analysis showed that the microbial resistance index was negatively correlated 
      with the relative abundance of potential plant pathogens and positively 
      correlated with soybean yields in both bulk and rhizosphere soils. Intriguingly, 
      the random forest (RF) analysis showed that archaea contributed the most to soil 
      microbial resistance even though they were not at the core positions of the 
      network. Overall, structural equation models (SEMs) revealed that high resistant 
      microbial community could directly or indirectly improved soybean yields by 
      regulating the relative abundance of plant pathogens and the soil nutrients, 
      suggesting that the regulation of soil microbial taxa may play an important role 
      in maintaining agricultural productivity under continuous cropping of soybean.

AB  - Forest soils are a pressing subject of worldwide research owing to the several 
      roles of forests such as carbon sinks. Currently, the living soil ecosystem has 
      become dreadful as a consequence of several anthropogenic activities including 
      climate change. Climate change continues to transform the living soil ecosystem 
      as well as the soil microbiome of planet Earth. The majority of studies have 
      aimed to decipher the role of forest soil bacteria and fungi to understand and 
      predict the impact of climate change on soil microbiome community structure and 
      their ecosystem in the environment. In forest soils, microorganisms live in 
      diverse habitats with specific behavior, comprising bulk soil, rhizosphere, 
      litter, and deadwood habitats, where their communities are influenced by biotic 
      interactions and nutrient accessibility. Soil microbiome also drives multiple 
      crucial steps in the nutrient biogeochemical cycles (carbon, nitrogen, 
      phosphorous, and sulfur cycles). Soil microbes help in the nitrogen cycle through 
      nitrogen fixation during the nitrogen cycle and maintain the concentration of 
      nitrogen in the atmosphere. Soil microorganisms in forest soils respond to 
      various effects of climate change, for instance, global warming, elevated level 
      of CO(2), drought, anthropogenic nitrogen deposition, increased precipitation, 
      and flood. As the major burning issue of the globe, researchers are facing the 
      major challenges to study soil microbiome. This review sheds light on the current 
      scenario of knowledge about the effect of climate change on living soil 
      ecosystems in various climate-sensitive soil ecosystems and the consequences for 
      vegetation-soil-climate feedbacks.

      reduction of methanogenic archaea in the rhizosphere.

AB  - Cattle ranching is the largest driver of deforestation in the Brazilian Amazon. 
      The rainforest-to-pasture conversion affects the methane cycle in upland soils, 
      changing it from sink to source of atmospheric methane. However, it remains 
      unknown if management practices could reduce the impact of land-use on methane 
      cycling. In this work, we evaluated how pasture management can regulate the soil 
      methane cycle either by maintaining continuous grass coverage on pasture soils, 
      or by liming the soil to amend acidity. Methane fluxes from forest and pasture 
      soils were evaluated in moisture-controlled greenhouse experiments with and 
      without grass cover (Urochloa brizantha cv. Marandu) or liming. We also assessed 
      changes in the soil microbial community structure of both bare (bulk) and 
      rhizospheric pasture soils through high throughput sequencing of the 16S rRNA 
      gene, and quantified the methane cycling microbiota by their respective marker 
      genes related to methane generation (mcrA) or oxidation (pmoA). The experiments 
      used soils from eastern and western Amazonia, and concurrent field studies 
      allowed us to confirm greenhouse data. The presence of a grass cover not only 
      increased methane uptake by up to 35% in pasture soils, but also reduced the 
      abundance of the methane-producing community. In the grass rhizosphere this 
      reduction was up to 10-fold. Methane-producing archaea belonged to the genera 
      Methanosarcina sp., Methanocella sp., Methanobacterium sp., and Rice Cluster I. 
      Further, we showed that soil liming to increasing pH compromised the capacity of 
      forest and pasture soils to be a sink for methane, and instead converted formerly 
      methane-consuming forest soils to become methane sources in only 40-80 days. 
      Liming reduced the relative abundance of Beijerinckiacea family in forest soils, 
      which account for many known methanotrophs. Our results demonstrate that pasture

TI  - Effects of Biochar on the Growth and Development of Tomato Seedlings and on the 
      Response of Tomato Plants to the Infection of Systemic Viral Agents.
PG  - 862075

AB  - Biochar is a rich carbon product obtained by pyrolysis of biomass under a limited 
      supply of oxygen. It is composed mainly of aromatic molecules, but its agronomic 
      value is hard to evaluate and difficult to predict due to its great variable 
      characteristics depending on the type of starting biomass and the conditions of 
      pyrolysis. Anyway, it could be used as soil amendment because it increases the 
      soil fertility of acidic soils, increases the agricultural productivity, and 
      seems to provide protection against some foliar and soilborne diseases. In this 
      study, the effects of biochar, obtained from olive pruning, have been evaluated 
      on tomato seedlings growth and on their response to systemic agents' infection 
      alone or added with beneficial microorganisms (Bacillus spp. and Trichoderma 
      spp.). First, experimental data showed that biochar seems to promote the 
      development of the tomato seedlings, especially at concentrations ranging from 1 
      to 20% (w/w with peat) without showing any antimicrobial effects on the 
      beneficial soil bacteria at the tomato rhizosphere level and even improving their 
      growth. Thus, those concentrations were used in growing tomato plants 
      experimentally infected with tomato spotted wilt virus (TSWV) and potato spindle 
      tuber viroid (PSTVd). The biochar effect was estimated by evaluating three 
      parameters, namely, symptom expression, number of infected plants, and pathogen 
      quantification, using RT-qPCR technique and -DeltaDeltaCt analysis. Biochar at 10-15% and 
      when added with Trichoderma spp. showed that it reduces the replication of PSTVd 
      and the expression of symptoms even if it was not able to block the start of 
      infection. The results obtained on TSWV-infected plants suggested that biochar 
      could contribute to reducing both infection rate and virus replication. For 
      systemic viral agents, such as PSTVd and TSWV, there are no curative control 
      methods, and therefore, the use of prevention means, as can be assumed the use 
      biochar, for example, in the nursery specialized in horticultural crops, can be 
      of great help. These results can be an encouraging starting point to introduce 
      complex biochar formulates among the sustainable managing strategies of plant 
      systemic diseases.

AB  - Root exudates are well-known 'labile' sources of soil carbon that can prime 
      microbial activity. Recent investigations suggest that the stability of labile 
      carbon inputs in soil mostly depends upon the physical, chemical, and biological 
      properties of the surroundings. Here, we propose that, in some ecosystems, such 
      as forests and grasslands, root exudates can function as a source of soil organic 
      carbon (SOC) that can be stabilized through various mechanisms leading to 
      long-term sequestration. Increasing soil carbon sequestration is important for 
      capturing atmospheric CO(2) and combating climate change issues. Thus, there is 
      an urgent need to preserve existing ecosystems and to adopt strategies such as 
      afforestation, reforestation, and establishment of artificial grasslands to 
      foster carbon sequestration through higher root exudate inputs in the soil.

AB  - Phytoremediation is an effective remediation process for heavy metal 
      contamination. The primary zone of phytoremediation is the rhizosphere where the 
      plants uptake the heavy metals from the soil matrix. The bioavailability of the 
      contaminants in the rhizosphere is affected by the physical, chemical, and 
      biological conditions of the rhizosphere. In the study area of the Apalachicola 
      National Forest, the concentrations of As, Pb and Cr in the bulk soil (n = 20) 
      were 515.81, 220.77, and 2.02 mg/kg soil, respectively. Using a sequential 
      extraction method, the bioavailability of heavy metals in the bulk soil (S-NR) 
      and rhizosphere soil (S-R) was characterized. The results showed that the 
      bioavailability of the three heavy metals had the order of Cr > Pb > As for S-NR 
      and Pb > As > Cr for S-R. The bioavailability of these metals was affected by the 
      nature of the heavy metals and the soil physicochemical properties. Native plant 
      Eriocaulon decangulare could uptake a large number of heavy metals from the 
      natural soil, demonstrating great phytoremediation potential for metal 
      contamination. Energy Dispersive Spectroscopy (EDS) mapping successfully located 
      the dominant accumulation of heavy metals in aerial parts of E. decangulare. E. 
      decangulare was also found to be highly selective and Pb and As were both 
      extensively accumulated in the shoots and roots. Cr was significantly immobilized 
      in the rhizosphere soil, and also accumulated in the root of E. decangulare. This 
      study not only correlated the phytoremediation potential with heavy metal 
      bioavailability and soil physicochemical properties, but also demonstrated the 
      important role of the nature of heavy metals played during the phytoremediation.

AB  - Plant roots and associated mycorrhizae exert a large influence on soil carbon (C) 
      cycling. Yet, little was known whether and how roots and ectomycorrhizal (ECM) 
      extraradical mycelia differentially contribute to soil organic C (SOC) 
      accumulation in alpine forests under increasing nitrogen (N) deposition. Using 
      ingrowth cores, the relative contributions of the root pathway (RP; i.e., roots 
      and rhizosphere processes) and mycelium pathway (MP; i.e., extraradical mycelia 
      and hyphosphere processes) to SOC accumulation were distinguished and quantified 
      in an ECM-dominated forest receiving chronic N addition (25 kg N ha(-1)  year(-1) 
      ). Under the non-N addition, the RP facilitated SOC accumulation, although the MP 
      reduced SOC accumulation. Nitrogen addition enhanced the positive effect of RP on 
      SOC accumulation from +18.02 to +20.55 mg C g(-1) but counteracted the negative 
      effect of MP on SOC accumulation from -5.62 to -0.57 mg C g(-1) , compared with 
      the non-N addition. Compared with the non-N addition, the N-induced SOC 
      accumulation was 1.62-2.21 and 3.23-4.74 mg C g(-1) , in the RP and the MP, 
      respectively. The greater contribution of MP to SOC accumulation was mainly 
      attributed to the higher microbial C pump (MCP) efficacy (the proportion of 
      increased microbial residual C to the increased SOC under N addition) in the MP 
      (72.5%) relative to the RP (57%). The higher MCP efficacy in the MP was mainly 
      associated with the higher fungal metabolic activity (i.e., the greater fungal 
      biomass and N-acetyl glucosidase activity) and greater binding efficiency of 
      fungal residual C to mineral surfaces than those of RP. Collectively, our 
      findings highlight the indispensable role of mycelia and hyphosphere processes in 
      the formation and accumulation of stable SOC in the context of increasing N 
      deposition.

AB  - Forest fires alter soil microbial communities that are essential to support 
      ecosystem recovery following land burning. These alterations have different 
      responses according to soil abiotic pre- and post-fire conditions and fire 
      severity, among others, and tend to decrease along vegetation recovery over time. 
      Thus, understanding the effects of fires on microbial soil communities is 
      critical to evaluate ecosystem resilience and restoration strategies in 
      fire-prone ecosystems. We studied the state of community-level physiological 
      profiles (CLPPs) and the prokaryotic community structure of rhizosphere and bulk 
      soils from two fire-affected sclerophyll forests (one surveyed 17 months and the 
      other 33 months after fire occurrence) in the Mediterranean climate zone of 
      central Chile. Increases in catabolic activity (by average well color development 
      of CLPPs), especially in the rhizosphere as compared with the bulk soil, were 
      observed in the most recently affected site only. Legacy of land burning was 
      still clearly shaping soil prokaryote community structure, as shown by 
      quantitative PCR (qPCR) and Illumina MiSeq sequencing of the V4 region of the 16S 
      rRNA gene, particularly in the most recent fire-affected site. The qPCR copy 
      numbers and alpha diversity indexes (Shannon and Pielou's evenness) of sequencing 
      data decreased in burned soils at both locations. Beta diversity analyses showed 
      dissimilarity of prokaryote communities at both study sites according to fire 
      occurrence, and NO(3) (-) was the common variable explaining community changes 
      for both of them. Acidobacteria and Rokubacteria phyla significantly decreased in 
      burned soils at both locations, while Firmicutes and Actinobacteria increased. 
      These findings provide a better understanding of the resilience of soil 
      prokaryote communities and their physiological conditions in Mediterranean 
      forests of central Chile following different time periods after fire, conditions 
      that likely influence the ecological processes taking place during recovery of 
      fire-affected ecosystems.

TI  - Phytophthora cinnamomi causing root rot on Rhododendron lapponicum and control it 
      using potential biocontrol agents.
PG  - 937-947
LID - 10.1002/jobm.202200034 [doi]
AB  - Rhododendron lapponicum (R. lapponicum) is a dwarf Rhododendron species, which is 
      severely infected with root rot and wilt in Yunnan province, China. However, the 
      causal agent causing these symptoms was unknown. An isolate, Pci-1 was identified 
      as Phytophthora cinnamomi, based on its morphology and the sequences of 
      beta-tubulin, internal transcribed spacer, and Ypt1 genes and verified according to 
      the Koch's postulate. We found that this pathogen could infect 14 species of 
      plants, including Althaea rosea, Viburnum cylindricum, and Brassica napus. Strain 
      Pci-1 could cause R. lapponicum to wither and die; and it grows best in an oat 
      medium with pH 7.0 - 8.0 and an optimum temperature of 27 degrees C. We suggest that the 
      rhizosphere of R. lapponicum treated with biocontrol strains Paenibacillus 
      polymyxoides P2-5 and Trichoderma asperellum Tv-1 showed a significant inhibitory 
      effect on pathogen Pci-1. The inhibitory effect of 70% dimethomorph + cymoxanil 
      was significantly higher with EC(50) and EC(90) values of 0.1894 and 
      0.3618 a.i. microg/ml, respectively. Greenhouse experiments revealed that the 
      pathogen load is decreased in the presence of potential antagonists. This study 
      provides fundamentals on risk assessment and theoretical support for the 
      management of P. cinnamomi pathogen and contributes significantly to the planting 
      of forest and horticultural crops in a disease-free environment.

TI  - [Modification of quicklime on acid soil under forest and their effect on the 
      growth of Panax notoginseng].
PG  - 972-980

AB  - Soil acidification is an important factor leading to poor growth and root rot 
      disease of Panax notoginseng in the understorey of forests. In this study, 
      different amounts of quicklime (0, 500, 1000, 1500 and 2000 kg.hm(-2)) were 
      amended into acid soil under forest. We evaluated the effect of quikelime 
      addition on soil chemical properties, phenols, rhizosphere microorganisms and 
      growth of P. notoginseng. The results showed that an appro-priate amount of 
      quicklime addition (500-1000 kg.hm(-2)) could significantly increase soil pH, 
      decrease the content of phenols (p-hydroxybenzoic acid, vanillin, syringic acid, 
      ferulic acid and vanillic acid), promote P. notoginseng growth, and reduce the 
      incidence of root rot disease. An appropriate amount of quicklime (500-1000 
      kg.hm(-2)) could significantly reduce the fungi:bacteria ratio, increase bacteria 
      diversity, and increase the relative abundance of Ascomycota and Proteobacteria 
      as well as Massilia and Sphingomonas. However, excessive quicklime addition 
      (1500-2000 kg.hm(-2)) could reduce the content of available nitrogen and organic 
      matter, and inhibit P. notoginseng growth. Therefore, 500-1000 kg.hm(-2) of 
      quicklime amendment could improve the chemical properties and microbial community 
      of acid soil under forest, thereby promoting P. notoginseng growth, and reducing 
      the incidence of root rot disease.

AB  - A novel bacterium of the genus Pontibacter, designated GY10130(T), was isolated 
      from rhizosphere soil of a mangrove plant Rhizophora stylosa collected from 
      Guangxi province, China. Strain GY10130(T) was Gram-stain negative, positive for 
      oxidase activities, aerobic, short rod-shaped cells without flagella. Growth was 
      observed at 10-40  degrees C (optimum, 28  degrees C), pH 6.0-9.0 (optimum, 7.0) and NaCl 
      concentrations of 0-4% (optimum, 1%). Strain GY10130(T) is closely related to 
      members of the genus Pontibacter, namely P. beigongshangensis CGMCC 1.17104(T) 
      (97.8%) and P. amylolyticus CGMCC 1.12749(T) (95.0%), P. humi SWU8(T) (94.7%), 
      and less than 94.0% with other currently described type strains of Pontibacter. 
      The strain GY10130(T) showed an ANI value of 80.6% and dDDH value of 23.2% with 
      P. beigongshangensis CGMCC 1.17104(T), followed by P. amylolyticus CGMCC 
      1.12749(T) with ANI and dDDH values of 72.9 and 13.8%, respectively. Strain 
      GY10130(T) contains carotenoid-like pigments, but flexirubin-type pigments were 
      absent. The cellular fatty acids (> 10%) consist of summed feature 4 (17:1 iso 
      I/anteiso B) and iso-C(15:0). The predominant menaquinone is MK-7. The polar 
      lipids comprise phosphatidylethanolamine, two unidentified glycolipids, two 
      unidentified aminolipids and six unidentified phospholipids. The genome length of 
      strain GY10130(T) was 6.2 Mbp with a DNA G + C content of 47.1 mol% and 4727 
      protein-coding genes. The result of polyphasic taxonomic study show strain 
      GY10130(T) represents one novel species of Pontibacter, Pontibacter qinzhouensis 
      sp. nov., with the type strain GY10130(T) (=NBRC 113901(T)  = CGMCC 1.16772(T)).

AB  - Excessive nutrient inputs imperil the stability of forest ecosystems via 
      modifying the interactions among soil properties, microbes, and plants, 
      particularly in forests composed of cash crops that are under intensive 
      disturbances of agricultural activities, such as Torreya grandis. Understanding 
      the potential drivers of soil microbial community helps scientists develop 
      effective strategies for balancing the protection and productivity of the ancient 
      Torreya forest. Here, we assayed the link between plant and soil parameters and 
      prokaryote communities in bulk soil and T. grandis rhizosphere in 900-year-old 
      stands by detecting plant and soil properties in two independent sites in 
      southeastern China. Our results showed no apparent influence of stand age on the 
      compositions of prokaryote communities in bulk soil and T. grandis rhizosphere. 
      In contrast, soil abiotic factors (i.e., soil pH) overwhelm plant characteristics 
      (i.e., height, plant tissue carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus content) and 
      contribute most to the shift in prokaryote communities in bulk soil and T. 
      grandis rhizosphere. Soil pH leads to an increase in microbiota alpha diversity 
      in both compartments. With the help of a random forest, we found a critical 
      transition point of pH (pH = 4.9) for the dominance of acidic and near-neutral 
      bacterial groups. Co-occurrence network analysis further revealed a substantially 
      simplified network in plots with a pH of <4.9 versus samples with a pH of >/=4.9, 
      indicating that soil acidification induces biodiversity loss and disrupts 
      potential interactions among soil microbes. Our findings provide empirical 
      evidence that soil abiotic properties nearly completely offset the roles of host 
      plants in the assembly and potential interactions of rhizosphere microorganisms. 
      Hence, reduction in inorganic fertilization and proper liming protocols should be 
      seriously considered by local farmers to protect ancient Torreya forests.

AB  - Three yellow-colored strains, NC2-4-308(T), NC3-4-326 and NA3-4-109, were 
      isolated from the rhizosphere soil of Larix gmelinii in Nanwenghe Nature Reserve, 
      Great Khingan, China. These strains were oxidase- and catalase-positive and 
      Gram-staining-negative. The cells were non-motile short rods that were aerobic 
      and non-spore-forming. Growth occurred at pH values of 5.0-8.0 and at 0-4% (w/v) 
      NaCl. The three strains were resistant to low temperature and grew at 2-35  degrees C. 
      The principal fatty acids (> 5%) were summed feature 9, iso-C(15:0), iso-C(17:0) 
      and anteiso-C(15:0). The predominant quinone was ubiquinone-8. The polar lipids 
      consisted of phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylglycerol, 
      diphosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylcholine, two unidentified phospholipids, 
      three unidentified lipids and three unidentified aminophospholipids. The DNA 
      G + C content of the type species was 64.0 mol%. The 16S rRNA gene sequence 
      similarities among the three strains are more than 99.9%, indicating they belong 
      to the same species. Phylogenetic analysis of the 16S rRNA gene, whole-genome 
      sequences, the low ANI (74.2-75.5%) and dDDH (19.3-20.1%) hybridization values 
      enabled differentiation of strains NC2-4-308(T), NC3-4-326 and NA3-4-109 from the 
      members of related genera. The combined data from the morphological, 
      physiological, biochemical and chemotaxonomic tests indicate the three strains as 
      a novel genus and a novel species in the family Rhodanobacteraceae. Therefore, we 
      propose a novel genus with the name Pinirhizobacter soli gen. nov., sp. nov., for 
      which the type strain is NC2-4-308(T) (= CFCC 14693(T) = KCTC 72394(T)).

TI  - Asymmetric belowground carbon transfer in a diverse tree community.
PG  - 3481-3495
LID - 10.1111/mec.16477 [doi]
AB  - Mycorrhizal fungi can colonize multiple trees of a single or multiple taxa, 
      facilitating bidirectional exchange of carbon between trees. Mycorrhiza-induced 
      carbon transfer was shown in the forest, but it is unknown whether carbon is 
      shared symmetrically among tree species, and if not, which tree species are 
      better donors and which are better recipients. Here, we test this question by 
      investigating carbon transfer dynamics among five Mediterranean tree species in a 
      microcosm system, including both ectomycorrhizal (EM) and arbuscular (AM) plants. 
      Trees were planted together in "community boxes" using natural soil from a mixed 
      forest plot that serves as a habitat for all five tree species and their native 
      mycorrhizal fungi. In each box, only the trees of a single species were 
      pulse-labelled with (13) CO(2) . We found that carbon transfer was asymmetric, 
      with oak being a better donor, and pistacia and cypress better recipients. Shared 
      mycorrhizal species may have facilitated carbon transfer, but their diversity did 
      not affect the amount, nor timing, of the transfer. Overall, our findings in a 
      microcosm system expose rich, but hidden, belowground interactions in a diverse 
      population of trees and mycorrhizal fungi. The asymmetric carbon exchange among 
      cohabiting tree species could potentially contribute to forest resilience in an 
      uncertain future.

TI  - Carbon allocation to root exudates is maintained in mature temperate tree species 
      under drought.
PG  - 965-977
LID - 10.1111/nph.18157 [doi]
AB  - Carbon (C) exuded via roots is proposed to increase under drought and facilitate 
      important ecosystem functions. However, it is unknown how exudate quantities 
      relate to the total C budget of a drought-stressed tree, that is, how much of 
      net-C assimilation is allocated to exudation at the tree level. We calculated the 
      proportion of daily C assimilation allocated to root exudation during early 
      summer by collecting root exudates from mature Fagus sylvatica and Picea abies 
      exposed to experimental drought, and combining above- and belowground C fluxes 
      with leaf, stem and fine-root surface area. Exudation from individual roots 
      increased exponentially with decreasing soil moisture, with the highest increase 
      at the wilting point. Despite c. 50% reduced C assimilation under drought, 
      exudation from fine-root systems was maintained and trees exuded 1.0% (F. 
      sylvatica) to 2.5% (P. abies) of net C into the rhizosphere, increasing the 
      proportion of C allocation to exudates two- to three-fold. Water-limited P. abies 
      released two-thirds of its exudate C into the surface soil, whereas in droughted 
      F. sylvatica it was only one-third. Across the entire root system, droughted 
      trees maintained exudation similar to controls, suggesting drought-imposed 
      belowground C investment, which could be beneficial for ecosystem resilience.

TI  - [Structure and Functional Diversity of Bacterial Community in Rhizosphere Soil of 
      Typical Vegetation in the Riparian Zone Along the Downstream of Songhua River].
PG  - 2182-2191
LID - 10.13227/j.hjkx.202106238 [doi]
AB  - The aim of this study was to provide a reference for the riparian zone with 
      protection and ecological restoration by analyzing the differences in typical 
      vegetation (Phragmites communis, Populus tomentosa, Salix sungkianica, and Carex 
      schmidtii) rhizosphere bacterial communities and their functions and identifying 
      the potential of different types of vegetation to restore the damaged riparian 
      zone in Songhua River. The 16S rRNA of rhizosphere soil bacteria in the four 
      typical vegetation types of the riparian zone along the downstream of the Songhua 
      River was sequenced using the Illumina MiSeq PE300 high-throughput sequencing 
      platform. The community diversity, functional differences, and influencing 
      factors of rhizosphere soil bacteria for different vegetation types were 
      analyzed. The results showed that the Ace index, Chao1 index, and Shannon index 
      of soil bacterial diversity in P.communis were significantly higher than those of 
      P.tomentosa (P<0.05), and there was no significant difference between the above 
      two types of vegetation and S. sungkianica and C.schmidtii. There were 
      significant differences between the soil bacterial community structure of P. 
      tomentosa and that of the three other vegetation types (P<0.05). The soil 
      bacterial community structures of S.sungkianica, C.schmidtii, and P.communis were 
      similar. Bacteria in the rhizosphere soil of the four typical vegetation types 
      could be divided into 38 phyla. Acidobacteria, Actinobacteria, Chloroflexi, 
      Verrucomicrobia, and Proteobacteria were the dominant phyla (relative 
      abundance>5%), and the Nitrospirae, Gemmatimonadetes, Bacteroidetes, Firmicutes, 
      and Rokubacteria of bacteria had a relative abundance greater than 1%. The 
      bacterial community in the rhizosphere soil of the four typical vegetation types 
      had 6 primary metabolic pathways and 43 secondary metabolic pathways, including 
      14 types of main secondary metabolic pathways (relative abundance>1%). Diversity 
      in rhizosphere soil bacterial communities of different vegetation types was 
      significantly influenced by the C/N ratio, soil pH, and moisture content. Hence, 
      the effects of different vegetation types in repairing the degraded riparian zone 
      were different, and wetland vegetation (S.sungkianica and C.schmidtii) was 
      conducive to the improvement in soil bacterial diversity and soil ecosystem 
      functions.

AB  - Increasing temperatures along with severe droughts are factors that may 
      jeopardize the survival of the forests in the Mediterranean basin. In this 
      region, Pinus pinaster is a common conifer species, that has been used as a model 
      species in evolutionary studies due to its adaptive response to changing 
      environments. Although its drought tolerance mechanisms are already known, 
      knowledge about the dynamics of its root microbiota is still scarce. We aimed to 
      decipher the structural (bacterial abundance), compositional, functional and 
      associative changes of the P. pinaster rhizosphere bacterial communities in 
      spring and summer, at DNA and RNA level (environmental DNA, live and dead cells, 
      and those synthesizing proteins). A fundamental aspect of root microbiome-based 
      approaches is to guarantee the correct origin of the samples. Thus, we assessed 
      the genotype of host needles and roots from which rhizosphere samples were 
      obtained. For more than 50% of the selected trees, genotype discrepancies were 
      found and in three cases the plant species could not be determined. Rhizosphere 
      bacterial communities were homogeneous with respect to diversity and structural 
      levels regardless of the host genotype in both seasons. Nonetheless, significant 
      changes were seen in the taxonomic profiles depending on the season. Seasonal 
      changes were also evident in the bacterial co-occurrence patterns, both in DNA 
      and RNA libraries. While spring communities switched to more complex networks, 
      summer populations resulted in more compartmentalized networks, suggesting that 
      these communities were facing a disturbance. These results may mirror the future 
      status of bacterial communities in a context of climate change. A keystone hub 
      was ascribed to the genus Phenylobacterium in the functional network calculated 
      for summer. Overall, it is important to validate the origin and identity of plant 
      samples in any plant-microbiota study so that more reliable ecological analyses 
      are performed.

TI  - The role of nutritional impairment in carbon-water balance of silver fir 
      drought-induced dieback.
PG  - 4439-4458
LID - 10.1111/gcb.16170 [doi]
AB  - Rear-edge populations at the xeric distribution limit of tree species are 
      particularly vulnerable to forest dieback triggered by drought. This is the case 
      of silver fir (Abies alba) forests located in Southwestern Europe. While silver 
      fir drought-induced dieback patterns have been previously explored, information 
      on the role played by nutritional impairment is lacking despite its potential 
      interactions with tree carbon-water balances. We performed a comparative analysis 
      of radial growth, intrinsic water-use efficiency (iWUE), oxygen isotopes (delta(18) 
      O) and nutrient concentrations in leaves of declining (DD) and non-declining (ND) 
      trees in silver fir in four forests in the Spanish Pyrenees. We also evaluated 
      the relationships among dieback predisposition, intraspecific trait variation 
      (wood density and leaf traits) and rhizosphere soil physical-chemical properties. 
      The onset of growth decline in DD trees occurred more than two decades ago, and 
      they subsequently showed low growth resilience against droughts. The DD trees 
      presented consistently lower foliar concentrations of nutrients such as P, K, Cu 
      and Ni than ND trees. The strong effects of foliar nutrient status on growth 
      resilience indices support the key role played by mineral nutrition in tree 
      functioning and growth before, during and after drought. In contrast, variability 
      in wood density and leaf morphological traits, as well as soil properties, showed 
      weak relationships with tree nutritional status and drought performance. At the 
      low elevation, warmer sites, DD trees showed stronger climate-growth 
      relationships and lower delta(18) O than ND trees. The uncoupling between iWUE and 
      delta(18) O, together with the positive correlations between P and K leaf 
      concentrations and delta(18) O, point to deeper soil/bedrock water sources and 
      vertical decoupling between nutrient and water uptake in DD trees. This study 
      provides novel insights into the mechanisms driving silver fir dieback and 
      highlights the need to incorporate tree nutrition into forest dieback studies.

AB  - Soil microorganisms play key roles in biogeochemical cycling in forest 
      ecosystems. However, whether the responses of microbial community with stand 
      development differed in rhizosphere and bulk soils remains unknown. We collected 
      rhizosphere and bulk soil in Chinese fir plantations with different stand ages 
      (7a, 15a, 24a, and 34a) in subtropical China, and determined bacterial and fungal 
      community variation via high-throughput sequencing. The results showed that soil 
      bacterial, but not fungal, community diversity significantly differed among stand 
      ages and between rhizosphere and bulk soils (p < 0.05). The differences in 
      Shannon-Wiener and Simpson's indices between rhizosphere and bulk soil varied 
      with stand age, with significant higher soil bacterial diversity in rhizosphere 
      than bulk soils in 7a and 34a plantations (p < 0.05), but there were no 
      significant difference in soil bacterial diversity between rhizosphere and bulk 
      soils in 15a and 24a plantations (p > 0.05). Soil microbial community composition 
      varied significantly with stand age but not between the rhizosphere and bulk 
      soil. The dominant bacterial phyla at all ages were Acidobacteria and 
      Proteobacteria, while the dominant fungal phyla were Ascomycota and Basidiomycota 
      in both rhizosphere and bulk soil. They showed inconsistent distribution patterns 
      along stand age gradient (7-34a) in the rhizosphere and bulk soil, suggesting 
      distinct ecological strategy (r-strategist vs. k-strategist) of different 
      microbial taxa, as well as changes in the microenvironment (i.e., nutrient 
      stoichiometry and root exudates). Moreover, bacterial and fungal community 
      composition in rhizosphere and bulk soil were governed by distinct driving 
      factors. TP and NH(4) (+)-N are the two most important factors regulating 
      bacterial and fungal community structure in rhizosphere soil, while pH and NO(3) 
      (-)-N, DON, and TN were driving factors for bacterial and fungal community 
      structure in bulk soil, respectively. Collectively, our results demonstrated that 
      the changes in microbial diversity and composition were more obvious along stand 
      age gradients than between sampling locations (rhizosphere vs. bulk soil) in 
      Chinese fir plantations.

AB  - Species in the genus Paenibacillus from special habitats have attracted great 
      attention due to their plant growth-promoting traits. A novel plant 
      growth-promoting rhizobacteria (PGPR) species in the genus Paenibacillus was 
      isolated from spruce forest at the height of 3,150 m in the Qilian Mountains, 
      Gansu province, China. The phylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA, rpoB, and 
      nifH gene sequences demonstrated that strain LC-T2 (T) was affiliated in the 
      genus Paenibacillus and exhibited the highest sequence similarity with 
      Paenibacillus donghaensis KCTC 13049 (T) (97.4%). Average nucleotide identity 
      (ANIb and ANIm) and digital DNA-DNA hybridization (dDDH) between strain LC-T2 (T) 
      and P. donghaensis KCTC 13049 (T) were 72.6, 83.3, and 21.2%, respectively, 
      indicating their genetic differences at the species level. These differences were 
      further verified by polar lipids profiles, major fatty acid contents, and several 
      distinct physiological characteristics. Meanwhile, the draft genome analysis 
      provided insight into the genetic features to support its plant-associated 
      lifestyle and habitat adaptation. Subsequently, the effects of volatile organic 
      compound (VOC) emitted from strain LC-T2 (T) on the growth of Arabidopsis were 
      evaluated. Application of strain LC-T2 (T) significantly improved root surface 
      area, root projection area, and root fork numbers by 158.3, 158.3, and 241.2%, 
      respectively, compared to control. Also, the effects of LC-T2 (T) on the growth 
      of white clover (Trifolium repens L.) were further assessed by pot experiment. 
      Application of LC-T2 (T) also significantly improved the growth of white clover 
      with root fresh weight increased over three-folds compared to control. 
      Furthermore, the viable bacterial genera of rhizosphere soil were detected in 
      each treatment. The number of genera from LC-T2 (T) -inoculated rhizosphere soil 
      was 1.7-fold higher than that of control, and some isolates were similar to 
      strain LC-T2 (T) , indicating that LC-T2 (T) inoculation was effective in the 
      rhizosphere soil of white clover. Overall, strain LC-T2 (T) should be attributed 
      to a novel PGPR species within the genus Paenibacillus based on phylogenetic 
      relatedness, genotypic features, and phenotypic and inoculation experiment, for 
      which the name Paenibacillus monticola sp. nov. is proposed.

AB  - Bambara groundnut (BGN) is an underutilized legume commonly found in sub-Saharan 
      Africa. It thrives in marginal soils and is resistant to drought stress. Several 
      studies have been carried out on the nutritional properties of BGN, but very 
      little is known about the effects of plant growth changes and development on 
      rhizosphere bacterial dynamics and function. This study reports on the bacterial 
      dynamics and function in the bulk and rhizosphere soils of BGN at different 
      growth stages (vegetative, flowering, pod-filling, and maturation stages). Aside 
      from the maturation stage that shows distinct community structure from the other 
      growth stages, results obtained showed no significant differences in bacterial 
      community structure among the other growth stages. At a closer level, 
      Actinobacteria, Proteobacteria, and Acidobacteria were dominant in rhizosphere 
      soils at all growth stages. The bulk soil had the least average phyla abundance, 
      while the maturity stage was characterized by the highest average phyla 
      abundance. Rubrobacter, Acidobacterium, and Skermanella were the most predominant 
      genus. It was observed from the analysis of operational taxonomic units that 
      there was significant change in the bacterial structure of the rhizosphere with a 
      higher abundance of potential plant growth-promoting rhizobacteria, at the 
      different growth stages, which include the genera Bacillus and Acidobacterium. 
      Biomarker analysis revealed 7 and 4 highly significant bacterial biomarkers by 
      linear discriminant analysis effect size and random forest analysis at the 
      maturation stage, respectively. The results obtained in this study demonstrated 
      that the bacterial communities of BGN rhizosphere microbiome dynamics and 
      function are influenced by the plant's growth stages.

TI  - Diversity of Sclerotium rolfsii antagonist fungi isolated from soils of the

AB  - Sclerotium rolfsii Sacc. the causative agent of white rot is one of the 
      destructive pathogens of nightshade crops. In Cote d'Ivoire, this fungal pathogen 
      constitutes a major constraint for the cultivation of tomato (Solanum 
      lycopersicum) with 41.01% crop losses in humid forest areas. Controlling this 
      fungus with synthetic chemicals can be effective, but harmful to human health and 
      the environment. The use of biological control agents could be an alternative 
      approach to control S. rolfsii. In this perspective, the objective of this work 
      was to select fungi from the rhizosphere of tomato crops capable of inhibiting 
      the growth of S. rolfsii. To do this, 153 fungi were isolated from the 
      rhizosphere and from direct confrontation tests 10 fungi whose antagonistic power 
      of S. rolfsii varied between 27 and 60% were selected. Molecular identification 
      (ITS) of these antagonist fungi revealed that the isolates belonged to the genera 
      Talaromyces sp. (n = 4), Trichoderma sp. (n = 3), Penicillium sp. (n = 2) and 
      Clonostachys sp. (n = 1). Among these fungi, Talaromyces purpureogenus and 
      Talaromyces assiutensis were able to diffuse compounds in agar capable of 
      inhibiting the growth of S. rolfsii. The chemical study of these 2 fungi made it 
      possible to identify mitorubrin and mitorubrinol produced by T. purpureogenus and 
      spiculisporic acid produced by T. assiutensis. Mitorubrin and mitorubrinol had 
      inhibitory activities of 100 and 70% at 10 mg/mL, respectively, whereas 
      spiculisporic acid showed moderate inhibition of 38 at 20 mg/mL of the growth of 
      S. rolfsii; however, its abundant production by the fungus could be an advantage 
      in the control of this phytopathogen. Isolated from the same biotope as 
      S. rolfsii, T. purpureogenus and T. assiutensis represent favorable candidates 
      for the biological control against S. rolfsii.

AB  - Finding novel anti-diabetic compounds with effective suppression activities 
      against hepatic glucagon response is urgently required for the development of new 
      drugs against diabetes. Fungi are well known for their ability to produce new 
      bioactive secondary metabolites. As part of our ongoing research, five new 
      indole-terpenoids (1-5), named encindolenes D-H, were isolated from the fungus 
      Penicillium sp. HFF16 from the rhizosphere soil of Cynanchum bungei Decne. The 
      structures of the compounds were elucidated by spectroscopic data and ECD 
      analysis. In the anti-diabetic activity assay, compounds 1-5 could inhibit the 
      hepatic glucose production with EC(50) values of 17.6, 30.1, 21.3, 9.6, and 9.9 
      muM, respectively, and decrease the cAMP contents in glucagon-induced HepG2 cells.

TI  - Application of Bioorganic Fertilizer on Panax notoginseng Improves Plant Growth 
      by Altering the Rhizosphere Microbiome Structure and Metabolism.

AB  - Bioorganic fertilizers can alleviate (a) biotic stresses and sustainably increase 
      crop yields. The effect of bioorganic fertilizers on the rhizosphere bacterial 
      community of Panax notoginseng and soil metabolism remains unknown. Here, we 
      tracked the changes in the soil physicochemical properties, bacterial microbiota 
      responses, and soil metabolic functions after the addition of a bioorganic 
      fertilizer in a P. notoginseng field. The application of a bioorganic fertilizer 
      reduced the soil acidification, improved the organic matter, and increased the 
      contents of the total/available soil nutrients. Soil amendment with a bioorganic 
      fertilizer significantly affected the structure of the rhizosphere bacterial 
      community, leading to the enrichment of specific bacterial consortia such as 
      Rhodanobacter, Arthrobacter, Sphingomonas, Devosia, Pseudolabrys, Luteimonas, 
      Lysobacter, Nitrosospira, and Nakamurella. Previously, many of these genera have 
      been associated with nutrient cycling, plant productivity, and disease 
      suppression. Metabolome analysis further highlighted that the bioorganic 
      fertilizer treatment significantly reduced phenolic acids and flavonoids and 
      enhanced organic acids, saccharides and alcohols, and amino acids. This result 
      indicates a high survival of bacterial microbiota in the rhizosphere and an 
      availability of nutrients for P. notoginseng growth. This work showed that the 
      application of bioorganic fertilizers significantly improves soil health status, 
      alters soil metabolic functions, and stimulates a specific subset of rhizosphere 
      microbiota for nutrient cycling and disease protection in P. notoginseng.

TI  - Structural and Metabolic Profiling of Lycopersicon esculentum Rhizosphere

      Drugs.

AB  - In this study, the effect of common non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs on 
      Lycopersicon esculentum rhizosphere microbiota was monitored. The experiments 
      were performed with artificially contaminated soil with ibuprofen (0.5 
      mg.kg(-1)), ketoprofen (0.2 mg.kg(-1)) and diclofenac (0.7 mg.kg(-1)). The 
      results evidenced that the rhizosphere microbiota abundance decreased especially 
      under exposure to diclofenac (187-201 nmol.g(-1) dry weight soil) and ibuprofen 
      (166-183 nmol.g(-1) dry weight soil) if compared with control (185-240 nmol.g(-1) 
      dry weight soil), while the fungal/bacteria ratio changed significantly with 
      exposure to diclofenac (<27%) and ketoprofen (<18%). Compared with control 
      samples, the average amount of the ratio of Gram-negative/Gram-positive bacteria 
      was higher in rhizosphere soil contaminated with ibuprofen (>25%) and lower in 
      the case of diclofenac (<46%) contamination. Carbon source consumption increased 
      with the time of assay in case of the control samples (23%) and those 
      contaminated with diclofenac (8%). This suggests that rhizosphere microbiota 
      under contamination with diclofenac consume a higher amount of carbon, but they 
      do not consume a larger variety of its sources. In the case of contamination with 
      ibuprofen and ketoprofen, the consumption of carbon source presents a decreasing 
      tendency after day 30 of the assay. Rhizosphere microbiota emitting volatile 
      organic compounds were also monitored. Volatile compounds belonging to alcohol, 
      aromatic compounds, ketone, terpene, organic acids, aldehyde, sulphur compounds, 
      esters, alkane, nitrogen compounds, alkene and furans were detected in 
      rhizosphere soil samples. Among these, terpene, ketone, alcohol, aromatic 
      compounds, organic acids and alkane were the most abundant compound classes 
      (>75%), but their percentage changed with exposure to diclofenac, ketoprofen and 
      ibuprofen. Such changes in abundance, structure and the metabolic activity of 
      Lycopersicon esculentum rhizosphere microbiota under exposure to common 
      non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs suggest that there is a probability to also 
      change the ecosystem services provided by rhizosphere microbiota.

AB  - Bacterial fruit blotch and seedling blight, caused by Acidovorax citrulli, is one 
      of the most destructive diseases of melon and watermelon in many countries. 
      Pathogen-free seed and cultural practices are major pillars of the disease 
      control. However, use of bacteriophages as natural biocontrol agents might also 
      contribute to the disease management. Therefore, we isolated 12 bacteriophages 
      specific to A. citrulli, from phyllosphere and rhizosphere of diseased watermelon 
      plants. The phage strains were characterized based on their host range, plaque 
      and virion morphology, thermal inactivation point, adsorption rate, one step 
      growth curve, restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP), and genomic 
      analysis. Transmission electron microscopy of three phage strains indicated that 
      they belong to the order Caudovirales, family Siphoviridae. All phages lysed 30 
      out of 32 tested A. citrulli strains isolated in Serbia, and did not lyse other 
      less related bacterial species. They produced clear plaques, 2 mm in diameter, on 
      bacterial lawns of different A. citrulli strains after 24 h of incubation. The 
      thermal inactivation point was 66 or 67 degrees C. They were stable at pH 5-9, but were 
      sensitive to chloroform and inactivated in either 5 or 10 min exposure to 
      ultraviolet (UV) light. RFLP analysis using EcoRI, BsmI and BamHI enzymes did not 
      show genetic differences among the tested phages. Adsorption rate and one step 
      growth curve were determined for the Acidovorax phage ACF1. Draft genome sequence 
      of the ACF1 phage was 59.377 bp in size, with guanine-cytosine (GC) content 
      64.5%, including 89 open reading frames. This phage shared a very high genomic 
      identity with Acidovorax phage ACPWH, isolated in South Korea. Evaluation of 
      systemic nature of ACF1 strain showed that it can be absorbed by roots and 
      translocated to upper parts of watermelon plants where it survived up to 10 days.

AB  - AIMS: Most studies focus on the effects of biofertilizer on the bacterial and 
      fungal communities, and we still lack an understanding of biofertilizer on the 
      protistan community. Here, the effects of biofertilizer containing Paenibacillus 
      triticisoli BJ-18 on composition and interaction of the protistan community in 
      the wheat rhizosphere were investigated. METHODS AND RESULTS: Biofertilizer 
      application altered soil physicochemical properties and the protistan community 
      composition, and significantly induced an alpha diversity decline. Random 
      forecast and redundancy analysis demonstrated that nitrogenase activity and 
      available phosphorus were the main drivers. Trichomonas classified to the phylum 
      Metamonada was enriched by biofertilizer, and was significantly positive 
      connected with soil nitrogenase activity and some function genes involved in 
      nitrogen-fixation and nitrogen-dissimilation. Biofertilization loosely connected 
      biotic interactions, while it did not affect the stability of the protistan 
      community. Besides, biofertilizer promoted the connections of protists with 
      fungi, bacteria, and archaea. Combined with biotic networks (protists, fungi, 
      bacteria, and archaea) and interactions between protists and soil physicochemical 
      properties/function genes, protists may act as keystone taxa potentially driving 
      soil microbiome composition and function. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: 
      Overall, these results suggest that the biofertilizer is a driver of the soil 
      protistan community, contributing to ecosystem functioning.

AB  - Exploring the complex spatiotemporal changes and colonization mechanism of 
      microbial communities will enable microbial communities to be better used to 
      serve agricultural and ecological operations. In addition, evaluating the impact 
      of transgenic plants on endogenous microbial communities is necessary for their 
      commercial application. In this study, microbial communities of Populus x 
      euramericana 'Neva' carrying Cry1Ac-Cry3A-BADH genes (ECAA1 line), Populus x 
      euramericana 'Neva' carrying Cry1Ac-Cry3A-NTHK1 genes (ECAB1 line), and 
      non-transgenic Populus x euramericana 'Neva' from rhizosphere soil, roots, and 
      phloem collected in different seasons were compared and analyzed. Our analyses 
      indicate that the richness and diversity of bacterial communities were higher in 
      the three Populus x euramericana 'Neva' habitats than in those of fungi. 
      Bacterial and fungal genetic-distance-clustering results were similar; 
      rhizosphere soil clustered in one category, with roots and phloem in another. The 
      diversity and evenness values of the microbial community were: rhizosphere soil > 
      phloem > root system. The bacterial communities in the three habitats were 
      dominated by the Proteobacteria, and fungal communities were dominated by the 
      Ascomycota. The community composition and abundance of each part were quite 
      different; those of Populus x euramericana 'Neva' were similar among seasons, but 
      community abundance fluctuated. Seasonal fluctuation in the bacterial community 
      was greatest in rhizosphere soil, while that of the fungal community was greatest 
      in phloem. The transgenic lines ECAA1 and ECAB1 had a bacterial and fungal 
      community composition similar to that of the control samples, with no significant 
      differences in community structure or diversity among the lines. The abundances 
      of operational taxonomic units (OTUs) were low, and differed significantly among 
      the lines. These differences did not affect the functioning of the whole specific 
      community. Sampling time and location were the main driving factors of changes in 
      the Populus x euramericana 'Neva' microbial community. Transgenic events did not 
      affect the Populus x euramericana 'Neva' rhizosphere or endophytic microbial 
      communities. This study provides a reference for the safety evaluation of 
      transgenic plants and the internal colonization mechanism of microorganisms in 
      plants.

TI  - First Report of Root Rot Caused by Phytophthora acerina on Metasequoia 
      glyptostroboides in China.
LID - 10.1094/PDIS-12-21-2722-PDN [doi]
AB  - Metasequoia glyptostroboides Hu & W. C. Cheng (Taxodiaceae), commonly called the 
      Chinese redwood or dawn redwood, is a well-known "living fossil" and rare relict 
      plant species endemic to China, which has been successfully cultivated throughout 
      the world (Ma 2007). In July to September 2020, trees of Chinese redwood which 
      were more than thirty years-old, showed symptoms of decline and death associated 
      with branch dieback, root and collar rot (Fig. 1) in Yangtze River 
      shelter-forests of Jiangling County in Hubei Province, China (112 degrees 15'19''E, 
      30 degrees 11'56''N; 40m). Diseased roots and rhizosphere soils were collected in 
      September 2020 and April 2021. Using the baiting method, a homothallic 
      Phytophthora sp. was recovered consistently from diseased roots and soil samples 
      of Chinese redwood. All the isolates of this Phytophthora sp. formed similar 
      colonies on V8 agar and corn meal agar (Fig. 2), and then three representative 
      isolates (L4-5-4, L4-5-5 and L4-5-6) were randomly selected for morphological and 
      molecular identification. In distilled water, semipapillate persistent sporangia 
      were borne in simple sympodial branched sporangiophores. Sporangia were 
      predominantly ovoid (Fig. 3a, d and f), but other shapes were observed including 
      subglobose (Fig. 3b), limoniform (Fig. 3c) or distorted shapes (Fig. 3e), 
      averaging 44.1 +/- 7.7 microm (n=102) in length and 32.8 +/- 5.2 microm (n=102) in width, 
      with narrow exit pores of 8.0 +/- 1.4 microm (n=93) and a length/breadth ratio of 1.3 +/- 
      0.10 (n=102). Chlamydospores were not observed. Oogonia were globose or 
      subglobose, 20.51 to 40.15 microm (av. 33.1 +/- 3.9 microm) (n=119) in diameter, with 
      smooth walls and paragynous antheridium (Fig. 3g-i). Oospores were globose or 
      subglobose in elongated oogonia with medium wall thickness of 1.9 +/- 0.5 microm 
      (n=36), aplerotic or plerotic and 16.9 to 32.6 microm in diameter (av. 26.6 +/- 3.8 microm) 
      (n=40). According to the above morphological characteristics, this Phytophthora 
      sp. was placed in Waterhouse's (1963) group III. The sequences of the internal 
      transcribed spacers (ITS) region of nuclear ribosomal DNA of each isolate 
      (GenBank Accession No. OK087320, OK087321 and OK087322) was 760 bp and had 
      identity of 99.84% with three P. acerina isolates (JX951285, JX951291 and 
      JX951296), while the 800 bp beta-tubulin (BTUB) sequences (OK140540, OK140541 and 
      OK140542) showed 99.97% homology to the sequence of P. acerina (KC201283) 
      (Ginetti, Moricca and Squires 2014) (Table 1). The ML phylogenetic trees were 
      established by comparing ITS and BTUB sequences of three Phytophthora strains 
      (L4-5-4, L4-5-5 and L4-5-6) with reference sequences of isolates of Phytophthora 
      in ITS and BTUB in GenBank (Fig. 4-5). Based on the morphological and molecular 
      characteristics, the strains were identified as namely P. acerina. In addition, 
      pathogenicity assays were performed with one of the three strains (L4-5-4) on M. 
      glyptostroboides using both one year old and three years old seedlings. Inoculum 
      was prepared by subculturing agar plugs from edges of CMA cultures into V8 medium 
      plates, incubating at 20 ℃ in darkness for 10 days. Six seedlings planted in pots 
      filled with sterilized soil were inoculated by mycelium plug at root collar and 
      stem wounded by a 8 mm diameter puncher. Six control seedlings were inoculated in 
      the same manner as above, and sterile agar plugs were used. After 35 days, 
      inoculated seedlings all had necrotic lesions at the inoculation sites, and some 
      seedlings had the symptoms of foliage blight and dieback, whereas control 
      seedlings remained healthy (Fig. 6). The number of fibrous roots after 
      inoculation was significantly less than the control, and the roots of inoculated 
      seedlings blackened or even rotted, while there were no obvious symptoms in the 
      control (Fig. 7). Phytophthora isolates recovered from the symptomatic tissues of 
      artificially inoculated plants were identical to isolate L4-5-4 in morphological 
      characters and ITS sequencing. This is the first report of P. acerina causing 
      root rot on the Chinese redwood in China. As only the seedlings were inoculated, 
      further research is needed to address the epidemiology and pathogenicity of P. 
      acerina to adult trees of Chinese red wood. References: Ginetti, B. et al. 2014.

AB  - Rhizosphere and endophytic microbiota significantly affect plant growth and 
      development by influencing nutrient uptake and stress tolerance. Herein, root and 
      rhizosphere soil of Acacia species were collected and analyzed to compare the 
      structural differences of the rhizosphere and root endophytic bacterial 
      communities. High-throughput 16S rRNA gene sequencing technology was employed to 
      analyze the rhizosphere and root endophytic bacterial communities. A total of 
      4249 OTUs were identified following sequence analysis. The rhizosphere soil 
      contained significantly more OTUs than the root soil. Principal component 
      analysis (PCA) and hierarchical cluster analysis indicated that bacterial 
      communities exhibited significant specificity in the rhizosphere and root soil of 
      different Acacia species. The most dominant phylum in the rhizosphere soil was 
      Acidobacteria, followed by Proteobacteria and Actinobacteria, whereas the 
      dominant phylum in the root soil was Proteobacteria, followed by Actinobacteria 
      and Acidobacteria. Among the various Acacia species, specific bacterial 
      communities displayed different abundance. We systematically described the core 
      bacteria in the rhizosphere and root endophytic bacterial communities and 
      predicted their relevant functions. The type and abundance of specific bacteria 
      were correlated with the nutrient absorption and metabolism of the Acacia 
      species. This study addresses the complex host-microbe interactions and explores 
      the rhizosphere and root bacterial community structure of different Acacia 
      species. These results provide new insights into the role of rhizosphere and root 
      endophytic bacterial communities on the growth and reproduction of Acacia, thus 
      informing future efforts towards sustainable development and utilization of 
      Acacia.

AB  - Root rot disease is a serious infection leading to production loss of Chinese 
      wolfberry (Lycium barbarum). This study tested the potential for two bacterial 
      biological control agents, Bacillus amyloliquefaciens HSB1 and FZB42, against 
      five fungal pathogens that frequently cause root rot in Chinese wolfberry. Both 
      HSB1 and FZB42 were found to inhibit fungal mycelial growth, in vitro and in 
      planta, as well as to promote the growth of wolfberry seedlings. In fact, a 
      biocontrol experiment showed efficiency of 100% with at least one treatment 
      involving each biocontrol strain against Fusarium oxysporum. Metagenomic 
      sequencing was used to assess bacterial community shifts in the wolfberry 
      rhizosphere upon introduction of each biocontrol strain. Results showed that HSB1 
      and FZB42 differentially altered the abundances of different taxa present and 
      positively influenced various functions of inherent wolfberry rhizosphere 
      bacteria. This study highlights the application of biocontrol method in the 
      suppression of fungal pathogens that cause root rot disease in wolfberry, which 
      is useful for agricultural extension agents and commercial growers.

TI  - Moso Bamboo Invasion Reshapes Community Structure of Denitrifying Bacteria in 
      Rhizosphere of Alsophila spinulosa.
LID - 10.3390/microorganisms10010180 [doi]
LID - 180
AB  - The uncontrolled invasion of moso bamboo (Phyllostachys pubescens) dramatically 
      alters soil nitrogen cycling and destroys the natural habitat of Alsophila 
      spinulosa. Nevertheless, no clear evidence points out the role of denitrifying 
      bacteria in the invasion of bamboo into the habitat of A. spinulosa. In the 
      present study, we found that low (importance value 0.0008), moderate (0.6551), 
      and high (0.9326) bamboo invasions dramatically altered the underground root 
      biomass of both P. pubescens and A. spinulosa. The root biomass of A. spinulosa 
      was maximal at moderate invasion, indicating that intermediate disturbance might 
      contribute to the growth and survival of the colonized plant. Successful bamboo 
      invasion significantly increased rhizospheric soil available nitrogen content of 
      A. spinulosa, coupled with elevated denitrifying bacterial abundance and 
      diversity. Shewanella, Chitinophaga, and Achromobacter were the primary genera in 
      the three invasions, whereas high bamboo invasion harbored more denitrifying 
      bacteria and higher abundance than moderate and low invasions. Further 
      correlation analysis found that most soil denitrifying bacteria were positively 
      correlated with soil organic matter and available nitrogen but negatively 
      correlated with pH and water content. In addition, our findings illustrated that 
      two denitrifying bacteria, Chitinophaga and Sorangium, might be essential 
      indicators for evaluating the effects of bamboo invasion on the growth of A. 
      spinulosa. Collectively, this study found that moso bamboo invasion could change 
      the nitrogen cycling of colonized habitats through alterations of denitrifying 
      bacteria and provided valuable perspectives for profound recognizing the invasive 
      impacts and mechanisms of bamboo expansion.

AB  - Soil bacterial communities and root-associated microbiomes play important roles 
      in the nutrient absorption and healthy growth of host plants. Cinnamomum camphora 
      is an important timber and special economic forest tree species in Fujian 
      Province. In this study, the high-throughput sequencing technique was used to 
      analyze the composition, diversity, and function of the bacterial communities 
      present in the soil from different samples and slope positions of C. camphora. 
      The results of this analysis demonstrated that the related bacterial communities 
      in C. camphora soil were mainly clustered based on sample type. Bacterial alpha 
      diversity in the rhizosphere and bulk soil of C. camphora growing downhill was 
      higher than that of C. camphora growing uphill. At the phylum level, 
      Bacteroidetes, Proteobacteria, Chloroflexi, and Gemmatimonadetes were positively 
      correlated with pH, available phosphorus, total phosphorus, available potassium, 
      and total potassium, while Acidobacteria and Verrucomicrobia were negatively 
      correlated with alkaline-hydrolyzable nitrogen. These results show that there 
      were remarkable differences in the composition, diversity, and function of 
      related bacterial communities between different sample types of C. camphora soil. 
      The slope position had a marked effect on the bacterial communities in the 
      rhizosphere and bulk soil, while the root endosphere remained unaffected.

AB  - Based on the importance and sensitivity of microbial communities to changes in 
      the forest ecosystem, soil microorganisms can be used to indicate the health of 
      the forest system. The metagenome sequencing was used to analyze the changes of 
      microbial communities between natural and plantation Castanea henryi forests for 
      understanding the effect of forest types on soil microbial communities. Our 
      result showed the soil microbial diversity and richness were higher in the 
      natural forests than in the plantation. Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria, and 
      Acidobacteria are the dominant categories in the C. henryi rhizosphere, and 
      Proteobacteria and Actinobacteria were significantly enriched in the natural 
      forest while Acidobacteria was significantly enriched in the plantation. 
      Meanwhile, the functional gene diversity and the abundance of functions in the 
      natural forest were higher than that of the plantation. Furthermore, we found 
      that the microbial network in the natural forests had more complex than in the 
      plantation. We also emphasized the low-abundance taxa may play an important role 
      in the network structure. These results clearly showed that microbial 
      communities, in response to different forest types, provide valuable information 
      to manipulate microbiomes to improve soil conditions of plantation.

AB  - Understanding the chemical make-up of soils and their structure is critical for 
      constraining the role of soil organic matter (SOM) into the global biogeochemical 
      cycles, as well as to understand the capability of SOM to sequester carbon and 
      mitigate greenhouse gas emissions. Here, we use two-dimensional (1)H-(13)C 
      heteronuclear single quantum coherence nuclear magnetic resonance (2D (1)H-(13)C 
      HSQC NMR) spectroscopy to structurally characterize the most refractory component 
      of SOM, the humic acid (HA). The observations from 2D (1)H-(13)C HSQC NMR were 
      coupled with lignin phenol and fatty acid measurements using tetramethylammonium 
      hydroxide (TMAH) thermochemolysis - two-dimensional gas chromatography - mass 
      spectrometry (TMAH-GC x GC-MS). We studied humic acids extracted from an 
      integrated Crop - Livestock - Forest System (CLFS) agricultural area and an 
      undisturbed Atlantic Native Forest (NF) area. We evaluated soils from two 
      different depths: the topsoil (0-20 cm) and subsoil (60-100 cm) layers, and 
      reveal the presence of oxidized ligninaceous phenols as we had previously 
      hypothesized. Collectively, our results indicate that there are significant 
      oxidative processes with increasing soil depth which are more pronounced in the 
      CLFS relative to the NF area. Degradation of stearic acid with increasing depth 
      in the CLFS soils indicated that the CLFS is more microbiologically active than 
      NF. Therefore, CLFS is less biochemically stable than we originally perceived. 
      The enhanced bio-reactivity of CLFS is likely driving the enhanced carbon 
      sequestration in the CLFS soils. This is perhaps due to the diversity of biomass 
      remnants available at the CLFS soil rhizosphere which allows for more different 
      types of biomass to be sequestered as oxidized ligninaceous phenols. Our results 
      employing structural characterization with 2D (1)H-(13)C HSQC NMR and 
      TMAH-GC x GC-MS provide a new layer of knowledge about the practice of integrated 
      agricultural systems and allow us to understand the structure and fate of 
      sequestered carbon in soils from different soil environments.

AB  - Trichoderma spp. are widely distributed in natural habitats and have been 
      evaluated as a potential biocontrol agent (BCA) for disease control and plant 
      growth promotion. In this study, 1308 Trichoderma strains were obtained from the 
      plant rhizosphere soil, above-ground plants, and decaying wood from natural 
      habitats in China. Among them, 49 Trichoderma strains showed a good inhibitory 
      effect, especially against Botrytis cinerea, Fusarium oxysporum, and 
      Colletotrichum gloeosporioides with inhibition rate above 85% in the dual culture 
      test. Among these 49 strains, the 13 strains with broad-spectrum inhibitory 
      effects also significantly promoted the seed germination of five crops (rice, 
      cucumber, tomato, melon, and pakchoi) and root growth of four crop seedlings 
      (watermelon, tomato, eggplant, and chili). Furthermore, these strains showed 
      effective colonization in the rhizosphere and root of cucumber. Trichoderma 
      strains SC012 and NX043 showed the highest chitinase and beta-1,3-glucanase activity 
      among all strains. Based on the morphological characterization and phylogenetic 
      analysis of the nuclear ribosomal internal transcribed spacer (ITS) and 
      translation elongation factor 1 (tef1), twelve Trichoderma strains were 
      identified as Trichoderma asperellum and one as Trichoderma afroharzianum. This 
      study suggests that the 13 Trichoderma strains are promising BCAs and could be 
      developed as biofertilizers and biological pesticides for agricultural 
      applications.

AB  - Plant secondary metabolites (SMs) play a crucial role in plant defense against 
      pathogens and adaptation to environmental stresses, some of which are produced 
      from medicinal plants and are the material basis of clinical efficacy and vital 
      indicators for quality evaluation of corresponding medicinal materials. The 
      influence of plant microbiota on plant nutrient uptake, production, and stress 
      tolerance has been revealed, but the associations between plant microbiota and 
      the accumulation of SMs in medicinal plants remain largely unknown. Plant SMs can 
      vary among individuals, which could be partly ascribed to the shift in microbial 
      community associated with the plant host. In the present study, we sampled fine 
      roots and rhizosphere soils of Sophora flavescens grown in four well-separated 
      cities/counties in China and determined the taxonomic composition of rhizosphere 
      bacterial communities using Illumina 16S amplicon sequencing. In addition, the 
      association of the rhizosphere bacterial microbiota with the accumulation of 
      alkaloids in the roots of S. flavescens was analyzed. The results showed that S. 
      flavescens hosted distinct bacterial communities in the rhizosphere across 
      geographic locations and plant ages, also indicating that geographic location was 
      a larger source of variation than plant age. Moreover, redundancy analysis 
      revealed that spatial, climatic (mean annual temperature and precipitation), and 
      edaphic factors (pH and available N and P) were the key drivers that shape the 
      rhizosphere bacterial communities. Furthermore, the results of the Mantel test 
      demonstrated that the rhizosphere bacterial microbiota was remarkably correlated 
      with the contents of oxymatrine, sophoridine, and matrine + oxymatrine in roots. 
      Specific taxa belonging to Actinobacteria and Chloroflexi were identified as 
      potential beneficial bacteria associated with the total accumulation of matrine 
      and oxymatrine by a random forest machine learning algorithm. Finally, the 
      structural equation modeling indicated that the Actinobacteria phylum had a 
      direct effect on the total accumulation of matrine and oxymatrine. The present 
      study addresses the association between the rhizosphere bacterial communities and 
      the accumulation of alkaloids in the medicinal plant S. flavescens. Our findings 
      may provide a basis for the quality improvement and sustainable utilization of 
      this medicinal plant thorough rhizosphere microbiota manipulation.

AB  - Plant nitrogen (N) uptake is affected by plant-plant interactions, but the 
      mechanisms remain unknown. A 15N-labeled technique was used in a pot experiment 
      to analyze the uptake rate of ammonium (NH4+) and nitrate (NO3-) by Abies 
      faxoniana Rehd. et Wils and Picea asperata Mast. in single-plant mode, 
      intraspecific and interspecific interactions. The results indicated that the 
      effects of plant-plant interactions on N uptake rate depended on plant species 
      and N forms. Picea asperata had a higher N uptake rate of both N forms than A. 
      faxoniana, and both species preferred NO3-. Compared with single-plant mode, 
      intraspecific interaction increased NH4+ uptake for A. faxoniana but reduced that 
      for P. asperata, while it did not change NO3- uptake for the two species. The 
      interspecific interaction enhanced N uptake of both N forms for A. faxoniana but 
      did not affect the P. asperata compared with single-plant mode. NH4+ and NO3- 
      uptake rates for the two species were regulated by root N concentration, root 
      nitrate reductase activity, root vigor, soil pH and soil N availability under 
      plant-plant interactions. Decreased NH4+ uptake rate for P. asperata under 
      intraspecific interaction was induced by lower root N concentration and nitrate 
      reductase activity. The positive effects of interspecific interaction on N uptake 
      for A. faxoniana could be determined mainly by positive rhizosphere effects, such 
      as high soil pH. From the perspective of root-soil interactions, our study 
      provides insight into how plant-plant interactions affect N uptake, which can 
      help to understand species coexistence and biodiversity maintenance in forest 
      ecosystems.

      following five-year consecutive application of soil amendments: Evidences for 
      improved soil health.

AB  - Soil amendments have been extensively used to remediate heavy metal contaminated 
      soils by immobilizing or altering edaphic properties to reduce the 
      bioavailability of heavy metals. However, the potential influences of long-term 
      soil amendments applications on microbial communities and polluted soil health 
      are still in its infancy despite that have been applied for decades. We used 
      amplicon sequencing and q-PCR array to characterize the root-associated microbial 
      community compositions and rhizosphere functional genes in a five-year field 
      experiment with consecutive application of four amendments (lime, biochar, pig 
      manure, and a commercial Mg-Ca-Si conditioner). Compared with the control, soil 
      amendments reduced the available Cd (CaCl(2) extractable Cd) in soils and 
      strongly affected bacterial community compositions in four root-associated 
      niches. Five rare keystone bacterial species were found belonging to the family 
      Gallionellaceae (1), Haliangiaceae (1), Anaerolineaceae (2), and 
      Xanthobacteraceae (1), which significantly correlated with soil pH and the 
      functional genes nifH and phoD. Random forest analysis showed that rhizosphere 
      soil pH and microbial functions, and root-associated keystone bacterial community 
      compositions mainly influenced the Cd concentrations in rice grains. Altogether, 
      our field data revealed five-year consecutive application of soil amendments 
      regulated root-associated microbial community assembly and enhanced microbial 
      functions, thereby improved rhizosphere health of Cd-contaminated soils.

AB  - This data in brief article represents the data set associated with a research 
      article published in Geoderma [1]. The data set represents figures showing the 
      spatial distribution of selected macro and micronutrients, and their 
      quantification in different crop or nutrient management systems practiced in the 
      boreal ecosystem. Spatial distribution of nutrients was measured by laser 
      ablation inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (LA‒ICP‒MS), using the new 
      techniques we developed to visualize nutrient distribution in intact soil cores 
      representative of the root rhizosphere. This data article supports the findings 
      published in the main article [1]. This work also demonstrates that LA-ICP-MS is 
      a valuable technique to image the spatial distribution of macro and 
      micronutrients in intact soil cores as affected by different crop management 
      practices.

TI  - Soil Bacterial Community Shifts Are Driven by Soil Nutrient Availability along a 
      Teak Plantation Chronosequence in Tropical Forests in China.
LID - 10.3390/biology10121329 [doi]
LID - 1329
AB  - Soil bacterial communities play crucial roles in ecosystem functions and 
      biogeochemical cycles of fundamental elements and are sensitive to environmental 
      changes. However, the response of soil bacterial communities to chronosequence in 
      tropical ecosystems is still poorly understood. This study characterized the 
      structures and co-occurrence patterns of soil bacterial communities in 
      rhizosphere and bulk soils along a chronosequence of teak plantations and 
      adjacent native grassland as control. Stand ages significantly shifted the 
      structure of soil bacterial communities but had no significant impact on 
      bacterial community diversity. Bacterial community diversity in bulk soils was 
      significantly higher than that in rhizosphere soils. The number of nodes and 
      edges in the bacterial co-occurrence network first increased and then decreased 
      with the chronosequence. The number of strongly positive correlations per network 
      was much higher than negative correlations. Available potassium, total potassium, 
      and available phosphorus were significant factors influencing the structure of 
      the bacterial community in bulk soils. In contrast, urease, total potassium, pH, 
      and total phosphorus were significant factors affecting the structure of the 
      bacterial community in the rhizosphere soils. These results indicate that 
      available nutrients in the soil are the main drivers regulating soil bacterial 
      community variation along a teak plantation chronosequence.

TI  - Vegetation and Environmental Changes on Contaminated Soil Formed on Waste from an 
      Historic Zn-Pb Ore-Washing Plant.
LID - 10.3390/biology10121242 [doi]
LID - 1242
AB  - Post-mining waste from Zn-Pb ore exploitation undergoes processes of spontaneous 
      succession and changes in soil chemical composition. The Zakawie area was 
      industrially transformed by historical mining activity, ore enrichment, and the 
      metallurgical processing of Zn-Pb ore. The subject of the study was to analyse 
      the rate of vegetation succession (from 1999 to 2019), soil chemistry, and the 
      relationships between them in an anthropogenic habitat with high concentrations 
      of potentially toxic metals. Ecological and geochemical studies were carried out 
      in an area contaminated with waste from a disused Zn-Pb ore-washing plant. 
      Between 1999 and 2019, the transformation of grassland and meadow vegetation into 
      scrub and forest-grassland communities was observed. This transformation led to a 
      decrease in the area of Molinietum caeruleae meadow (from 25.8% in 1999 to 10.7% 
      in 2019), whose place was taken by Prunus spinosa and Rhamnus cathartica. The 
      community of xerothermic limestone grasslands completely disappeared, being 
      replaced in favour of the Diantho-Armerietum and Prunus spinosa community. In 
      this period, the share of lifeforms of plants and species composition (46 and 60, 
      respectively) also changed. The Shannon and Simpson biodiversity index reached 
      high values in the second investigation period, and it was 0.893 and 0.86, 
      respectively. The anthrosols had a high content of Zn-85,360 mg kg(-1), Pb-28,300 
      mg kg(-1), Cd-340 mg kg(-1), and As-1200 mg kg(-1). Carbonates, clay minerals, 
      and fe-oxides are predominant in the mineral composition of the rhizosphere; the 
      metal-bearing phases are stable; and hardly soluble minerals include smithsonite, 
      cerussite, monheimite, hemimorphite, and oxides of Fe and Fe-Mn. 
      Mineralisation/crust processes formed on the epidermis, and their influences on 
      root development were found. Scanning electron microscopy and energy-dispersive 
      X-ray spectroscopy studies on rhizosphere soil components provide information on 
      the type of minerals and their susceptibility to heavy metals release. The 
      identification of some biotic and mineral structures in rhizospheres can be an 
      interesting source of information on pedogenic processes identified in 
      back-scattered electron images.

AB  - Arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi play a crucial role in promoting plant growth, 
      enhancing plant stress resistance, and sustaining a healthy ecosystem. However, 
      little is known about the mycorrhizal status of teak plantations. Here, we 
      evaluated how the AM fungal communities of rhizosphere soils and roots respond to 
      different stand ages of teak: 22, 35, 45, and 55-year-old from the adjacent 
      native grassland (CK). A high-throughput sequencing method was used to compare 
      the differences in soil and root AM fungal community structures. In combination 
      with soil parameters, mechanisms driving the AM fungal community were revealed by 
      redundancy analysis and the Mantel test. Additionally, spore density and 
      colonization rates were analyzed. With increasing stand age, the AM fungal 
      colonization rates and spore density increased linearly. Catalase activity and 
      ammonium nitrogen content also increased, and soil organic carbon, total 
      phosphorous, acid phosphatase activity, available potassium, and available 
      phosphorus first increased and then decreased. Stand age significantly changed 
      the structure of the AM fungal community but had no significant impact on the 
      diversity of the AM fungal community. However, the diversity of the AM fungal 
      community in soils was statistically higher than that in the roots. In total, 
      nine and seven AM fungal genera were detected in the soil and root samples, 
      respectively. The majority of sequences in soils and roots belonged to Glomus. 
      Age-induced changes in soil properties could largely explain the alterations in 
      the structure of the AM fungal community along a chronosequence, which included 
      total potassium, carbon-nitrogen ratio, ammonium nitrogen, catalase, and acid 
      phosphatase levels in soils and catalase, acid phosphatase, pH, and total 
      potassium levels in roots. Soil nutrient availability and enzyme activity were 
      the main driving factors regulating the shift in the AM fungal community 
      structure along a chronosequence of the teak plantations.

AB  - Root secreted acid phosphatases and organic anions are widely perceived as major 
      players of plant phosphorus (P) mobilisation from the rhizosphere under P 
      limiting growth conditions. Previous research indicated that other mechanisms 
      play a role, especially in species with fine roots, such as wheat. In this study 
      we characterised the plant-derived extracellular proteome of wheat roots by 
      profiling root tip mucilage, soluble root secreted and root tip proteomes. 
      Extracellular acid phosphatases and enzymes of the central carbon metabolism were 
      targeted using selected reaction monitoring. More than 140 proteins with 
      extracellular localisation prediction were identified in mucilage. P starvation 
      induced proteins predicted to be localised to the apoplast which are related to 
      cell wall modification and defence in both, root tip and soluble root-secreted 
      proteomes. Glycolytic enzymes were strongly increased in abundance by P 
      limitation in root tips, as were PEPC and plastidial MDH. Soluble acid 
      phosphatases were not identified in extracellular protein samples. Our results 
      indicate that root tip mucilage contains proteins with the functional potential 
      to actively shape their immediate environment by modification of plant structural 
      components and biotic interactions. Wheat acid phosphatases appear to play a 
      minor role in P mobilisation beyond the immediate root surface. SIGNIFICANCE: 
      Phosphorus (P) is a plant growth limiting nutrient in many agricultural 
      situations and the development of phosphorus efficient crops is of paramount 
      importance for future agricultural management practices. As P is relatively 
      immobile in soils, processes occurring at the root-soil interface, the 
      rhizosphere, are suspected to play a key role in plant-induced P mobilisation. 
      According to the current view, the secretion of extracellular acid phosphatases 
      and organic anions enhances P mobilisation within several millimetres beyond the 
      root surface, either directly or indirectly through the selection and appropriate 
      soil microbes. However, the mechanisms of P mobilisation in species with fine 
      roots, such as wheat, and the role of other secreted root proteins are poorly 
      understood. Here, we carried out the profiling of wheat root tip mucilage, 
      soluble root secreted and root tip proteomes. We analysed proteome changes in 
      response to P starvation. We found that proteins with a predicted localisation to 
      the apoplast made up a major proportion of stress-responsive proteins. Acid 
      phosphatases were not identified within extracellular protein samples, which were 
      enriched in proteins with predicted extracellular localisation. The absence of 
      extracellular APases was further validated by multiple reaction monitoring. Our 
      data indicates that wheat acid phosphatases play a minor role in P mobilisation 
      beyond the immediate root surface and provides a resource for breeding strategies 
      and further investigations of the functional roles of root tip-released proteins 
      in the rhizosphere under P limitation.

AB  - Olfactory cues guide plant parasitic nematodes (PPNs) to their host plants. We 
      tested the hypothesis that non-host plant root volatiles repel PPNs. To achieve 
      this, we compared the olfactory responses of infective juveniles (J2s) of the PPN 
      Meloidogyne incognita to four non-host Asteraceae plants, namely, black-jack 
      (Bidens pilosa), pyrethrum (Chrysanthemum cinerariifolium), marigold (Tagetes 
      minuta), and sweet wormwood (Artemisia annua), traditionally used in sub-Saharan 
      Africa for the management of PPNs. Chemical analysis by coupled gas 
      chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC/MS) combined with random forest analysis, 
      followed by behavioral assays, identified the repellents in the root volatiles of 
      B. pilosa, T. minuta, and A. annua as (E)-beta-farnesene and 1,8-cineole, whereas 
      camphor was attractive. In contrast, random forest analysis predicted repellents 
      for C. cinerariifolium and A. annua as beta-patchoulene and isopropyl hexadecanoate. 
      Our results suggested that terpenoids generally account for the repellency of 
      non-host Asteraceae plants used in PPN management.

AB  - Multiple sources of microplastics (MPs) in farmland could result in the changing 
      of microbial community and the plant growth. Most studies of MPs in agricultural 
      system have focused on the effects of single types of MPs on growth of plants, 
      while neglect interactions between multiple types of MPs. In this study a 
      pot-experiment was conducted to investigate the effects of multiple types of MPs, 
      including polystyrene beads: M1, 5 mum, M2, 70 nm and degradable mulching film 
      (DMF) fragments on growth of wheat seedlings and associated rhizosphere microbial 
      community. CKD (adding DMF) significantly reduced plant height and base diameter 
      of wheat seedlings. DMF in combination with M2, significantly increased plant 
      height and aboveground biomass, but decreased the base diameter. Actinobacteria 
      was the dominant taxa in the rhizosphere bacterial community in various 
      treatments. PCoA analysis showed that the bacterial composition in M2HD 
      (100 mg kg(-1) M(2) with DMF) was significantly different from that of CKD and 
      M2LD (10 mg kg(-1) M(2) with DMF). At the level of genera, the dominant fungi in 
      CKD and M2LD were in the genus Fusarium, which is the cause of wheat fusarium 
      blight and Alternaria, which results in decreased base diameter. In CK (control 
      group) and M2HD, Blastobotrys exhibited the greatest abundance, which assisted 
      wheat seedlings in resisting Verticillium disease. Cluster and PCoA analysis 
      showed the fungal composition in CKD was significantly different from CK, M2LD 
      and M2HD. These findings suggest MPs potentially have selective effects on 
      pathogens that affect growth of plants and potentially safety of the food.

TI  - The brown root rot fungus Phellinus noxius affects microbial communities in 
      different root-associated niches of Ficus trees.
PG  - 276-297
LID - 10.1111/1462-2920.15862 [doi]
AB  - Brown root rot (BRR) caused by Phellinus noxius is a destructive tree disease in 
      tropical and subtropical areas. To understand how BRR affects the composition of 
      the plant rhizoplane-enriched microbiota, the microbiomes within five 
      root-associated compartments (i.e., bulk soil, old/young root rhizosphere soil, 
      old/young root tissue) of Ficus trees naturally infected by P. noxius were 
      investigated. The level of P. noxius infection was determined by quantitative 
      PCR. Illumina sequencing of the internal transcribed spacer and 16S rRNA revealed 
      that P. noxius infection caused a significant reduction in fungal diversity in 
      the bulk soil, the old root rhizosphere soil, and the old root tissue. 
      Interestingly, Cosmospora was the only fungal genus positively correlated with P. 
      noxius. The abundance and composition of dominant bacterial taxa such as 
      Actinomadura, Bacillus, Rhodoplanes, and Streptomyces differed between 
      BRR-diseased and healthy samples. Furthermore, 838 isolates belonging to 26 
      fungal and 35 bacterial genera were isolated and tested for interactions with P. 
      noxius. Antagonistic activities were observed for isolates of Bacillus, 
      Pseudomonas, Aspergillus, Penicillium, and Trichoderma. Cellophane overlay and 
      cellulose/lignin utilization assays suggested that Cosmospora could tolerate the 
      secretions of P. noxius and that the degradation of lignin by P. noxius may 
      create suitable conditions for Cosmorpora growth.

TI  - A Verticillium longisporum pleiotropic drug transporter determines tolerance to

PG  - 291-303
LID - 10.1111/mpp.13162 [doi]
AB  - Terpenes constitute a major part of secondary metabolites secreted by plants in 
      the rhizosphere. However, their specific functions in fungal-plant interactions 
      have not been investigated thoroughly. In this study we investigated the role of 
      monoterpenes in interactions between oilseed rape (Brassica napus) and the 
      soilborne pathogen Verticillium longisporum. We identified seven monoterpenes 
      produced by B. napus, and production of alpha-pinene, beta-pinene, 3-carene, and 
      camphene was significantly increased upon fungal infection. Among them, beta-pinene 
      was chosen for further analysis. Transcriptome analysis of V. longisporum on 
      exposure to beta-pinene resulted in identification of two highly expressed 
      pleotropic drug transporters paralog genes named VlAbcG1a and VlAbcG1b. 
      Overexpression of VlAbcG1a in Saccharomyces cerevisiae increased tolerance to 
      beta-pinene, while deletion of the VlAbcG1a homologous gene in Verticillium dahliae 
      resulted in mutants with increased sensitivity to certain monoterpenes. 
      Furthermore, the VlAbcG1a overexpression   strain displayed an increased 
      tolerance to beta-pinene and increased virulence in tomato plants. Data from this 
      study give new insights into the roles of terpenes in plant-fungal pathogen 
      interactions and the mechanisms fungi deploy to cope with the toxicity of these 
      secondary metabolites.

AB  - Within the forest community, competition and facilitation between 
      adjacent-growing conspecific and heterospecific plants are mediated by 
      interactions involving common mycorrhizal networks. The ability of plants to 
      alter their neighbor's microbiome is well documented, but the molecular biology 
      of plant-fungal interactions during competition and facilitation has not been 
      previously examined. We used a common soil-plant bioassay experiment to study 
      molecular plant-microbial interactions among rhizosphere communities associated 
      with Pinus taeda (native host) and Populus trichocarpa (non-native host). Gene 
      expression of interacting fungal and bacterial rhizosphere communities was 
      compared among three plant-pairs: Populus growing with Populus, Populus with 
      Pinus, and Pinus with Pinus. Our results demonstrate that heterospecific plant 
      partners affect the assembly of root microbiomes, including the changes in the 
      structure of host specific community. Comparative metatranscriptomics reveals 
      that several species of ectomycorrhizal fungi (EMF) and saprotrophic fungi 
      exhibit different patterns of functional and regulatory gene expression with 
      these two plant hosts. Heterospecific plants affect the transcriptional 
      expression pattern of EMF host-specialists (e.g., Pinus-associated Suillus spp.) 
      on both plant species, mainly including the genes involved in the transportation 
      of amino acids, carbohydrates, and inorganic ions. Alteration of root microbiome 
      by neighboring plants may help regulate basic plant physiological processes via 
      modulation of molecular functions in the root microbiome.

      for halothermotolerant actinomycetes and proteolytic enzymes.

AB  - Actinomycetes are versatile about their metabolism, displaying high capacity to 
      produce bioactive metabolites. Enzymes from actinomycetes represent new 
      opportunities for industrial applications. However, proteases from actinomycetes 
      are poorly described by literature. Thereby, to verify proteolytic potential of 
      actinomycetes, the present study aimed the investigation of bacterial isolates 
      from Caatinga and Atlantic Forest rhizosphere. Fluorescence resonance energy 
      transfer (FRET) peptide libraries were adopted for the evaluations, since they 
      are faster and more qualitative methods, if compared with others described by 
      most reports. A total of 52 microorganisms were inoculated in different culture 
      media (PMB, potato dextrose agar, brain heart infusion agar, Starch Casein Agar 
      and Reasoner's 2A agar), temperatures (12, 20, 30, 37, 45 and 60 degrees C), and saline 
      conditions (0-4 M NaCl), during 7 days. The actinomycetes named as AC 01, 02 and 
      52 were selected and showed enzymatic abilities under the peptide probes 
      Abz-KLRSSKQ-EDDnp and Abz-KLYSSKQ-EDDnp, achieving enhanced performance at 30  degrees C. 
      Biochemical parameters were established, showing a predominance of alkaline 
      proteases with activity under saline conditions. Secreted proteases hydrolysed 
      preferentially polar uncharged residues (Y and N) and positively charged groups 
      (R). Phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid inhibited 
      the proteins, a characteristic of serine (AC 01 e 02) and metalloproteases (AC 
      52). All selected strains belonged to Streptomyces genera. In summary, 
      actinomycete strains with halophilic proteolytic abilities were selected, which 
      improve possibilities for their use in detergent formulations, food processing, 
      waste management and industrial bioconversion. It is important to highlight that 
      this is the first report using FRET libraries for proteolytic screening from 
      Caatinga and Atlantic Forest actinobacteria.

AB  - New promising manganese-containing nanobiocomposites (NCs) based on natural 
      polysaccharides, arabinogalactan (AG), arabinogalactan sulfate (AGS), and 
      kappa-carrageenan (kappa-CG) were studied to develop novel multi-purpose trophic low-dose 
      organomineral fertilizers. The general toxicological effects of manganese (Mn) on 
      the vegetation of potatoes (Solanum tuberosum L.) was evaluated in this study. 
      The essential physicochemical properties of this trace element in plant tissues, 
      such as its elemental analysis and its spectroscopic parameters in electron 
      paramagnetic resonance (EPR), were determined. Potato plants grown in an 
      NC-containing medium demonstrated better biometric parameters than in the control 
      medium, and no Mn accumulated in plant tissues. In addition, the synthesized NCs 
      demonstrated a pronounced antibacterial effect against the phytopathogenic 
      bacterium Clavibacter sepedonicus (Cms) and were proved to be safe for natural 
      soil microflora.

AB  - In the present study we assessed how modified rhizosphere pH and root exudation 
      (total carbon (C) and soluble proteins released) affected lead (Pb) solubility as 
      well as plant growth and Pb accumulation. A pot experiment with Pb polluted 
      agricultural soils was performed, which involved growing two species, Capsicum 
      annum (pepper) and Tagetes minuta, with the latter being a native herb indicated 
      as potential phytoextractor of Pb, in monocrop and co-cropping conditions. 
      Changes in plant growth, metal uptake as well as rhizosphere soil parameters (pH, 
      EC) and total C and protein exudation were determined. In addition, the metal 
      extraction efficiency of exudates released under mono- and co-cropped conditions 
      were investigated. Results showed that in contrast to the control soil (with low 
      Pb concentration), total C exudation was higher in co-cropping systems in Pb 
      contaminated soils which lead to increases in Pb uptake in both species. Exudates 
      originating from T. minuta were more efficient in solubilizing Pb than exudates 
      from pepper when grown under mono-cropping conditions. Exudates derived from 
      co-cropping both species were either equally or less efficient in mobilizing Pb 
      than exudates from T. minuta. The capacity of exudates to mobilize metals was 
      dependent not only on the species specific quality of root exudates released, but 
      also on its quantity, with the metal extraction efficiency increasing with C 
      concentration in exudates. However, the role of exuded proteins in Pb 
      solubilization was found to be negligible. Biochemical interactions in the 
      rhizosphere under co-cropping conditions favored metal solubilization, and 
      consequently Pb accumulation. The co-cropping conditions could allow accumulation 
      of Pb to levels in pepper that pose risks when the plants are used as a food 
      source.

AB  - Understanding the mechanisms that govern microbial community assembly across 
      soil-plant continuum is crucial for predicting the response of ecosystems to 
      environmental changes. However, the impact of the health status of plant on 
      microbial assembly across this continuum still remain poorly understood. Here, we 
      investigated how wheat yellow mosaic (WYM), caused by the wheat mosaic virus 
      transmitted by Polymyxa graminis, affected microbial assembly across soil (bulk 
      soil, rhizosphere soil), and plant (roots and leaves) continuum in a winter wheat 
      (Triticum aestivum L.) system in northern China, using null model analysis. The 
      results showed that deterministic processes dominated the bacterial community 
      assembly, whereas stochastic processes were primarily responsible for the 
      assembly of the fungal communities. With increasing levels of WYM, deterministic 
      processes were greatly enhanced for bacterial community assembly, accompanied by 
      a decrease in community niche breadth. Intensified competition between bacteria 
      and fungi and increased soil total nitrogen (TN) and soil organic carbon (SOC) 
      contents were mainly responsible for the enhanced deterministic processes for 
      bacterial community assembly. Random forest modeling indicated a strong potential 
      of rhizosphere bacterial community assembly for predicting the pathological 
      conditions of wheat. Structural equation modeling showed that disease level was 
      positively correlated with SOC and TN contents, competitions between bacteria and 
      fungi, and the contribution of variable selection processes to the bacterial 
      community assembly in the wheat rhizosphere. Our study revealed the ecological 
      mechanisms underlying the associations between microbial communities and 
      soil-borne disease, and highlighted the significance of microbial community 
      assembly for maintaining soil and plant health.

AB  - Drought is a major threat to crop productivity and causes decreased plant growth, 
      poor yields, and crop failure. Nevertheless, the frequency of droughts is 
      expected to increase in the coming decades. The microbial communities associated 
      with crop plants can influence how plants respond to various stresses; hence, 
      microbiome manipulation is fast becoming an effective strategy for improving the 
      stress tolerance of plants. The effect of drought stress on the root microbiome 
      of perennial woody plants is currently poorly understood. Using Populus trees as 
      a model ecosystem, we found that the diversity of the root microbial community 
      decreased during drought treatment and that compositional shifts in microbes 
      during drought stress were driven by the relative abundances of a large number of 
      dominant phyla, including Actinobacteria, Firmicutes, and Proteobacteria. A 
      subset of microbes, including Streptomyces rochei, Bacillus arbutinivorans, B. 
      endophyticus, B. megaterium, Aspergillus terreus, Penicillium raperi, Trichoderma 
      ghanense, Gongronella butleri, and Rhizopus stolonifer, was isolated from the 
      drought-treated poplar rhizosphere soils, which have potentially beneficial to 
      plant fitness. Further controlled inoculation experiments showed that the 
      isolated bacterial and fungal isolates positively impacted plant growth and 
      drought tolerance. Collectively, our results demonstrate the impact of drought on 
      root microbiome structure and provide a novel example of manipulating root 
      microbiomes to improve plant tolerance.

AB  - Sugarcane cultivars (Saccharum officinarum L.) are widely cultivated for both 
      sugar and renewable energy in China. The response of rhizosphere fungal 
      composition and diversity to different emerging sugarcane cultivars is limited. 
      Therefore, utilizing high-throughput sequencing, we explored fungal communities' 
      structure in soils adhering to six sugarcane cultivars' roots (Guitang 08-120, 
      Regan14-62, Guitang 08-1180, Haizhe 22, Liucheng 05-136, Taitang 22) in Guangxi 
      Province, China. Our results suggested that sugarcane varieties significantly 
      altered rhizosphere soil attributes, with Haizhe 22 having substantially lower 
      soil pH, organic matter (OM), available phosphorus (AP), and soil water contents 
      (SWC) than others cultivars. Different sugarcane varieties did not substantially 
      affected the Shannon fungal diversity index, but the apparent effect on fungal 
      richness was significant. Beta diversity analysis revealed that "Haizhe 22" 
      distinguished the fungal community from the other five cultivars. Soil pH, OM, 
      cultivars, and soil moisture were crucial determinants in shaping soil fungal 
      composition. The Haizhe 22 rhizosphere significantly enriched the operational 
      taxonomic units (OTUs) assigned to two fungal genera (Cephalotheca and 
      Sagenomella), while rhizosphere of other verities significantly enriched the OTUs 
      assigned to four fungal genera (Chaetomium, Chaetosphaeria, Mortierella, and 
      Talaromyces), suggesting their essential role in plant development, disease 
      tolerance, and bioremediation. These findings may help in selecting or breeding 
      innovative genotypes capable of supporting abundant rhizosphere fungi beneficial 
      to plants that would likely improve crops' agronomic potential and maintain soil 
      ecosystem sustainability.

AB  - Oil tea (Camellia spp.) is endemic to the hilly regions in the subtropics. 
      Camellia yuhsienensis is resistant to diseases such as anthracnose and root rot, 
      while Camellia oleifera is a high-yield species but susceptible to these 
      diseases. We hypothesize that differences in the rhizosphere microbial 
      communities and functions will elucidate the resistance mechanisms of these 
      species. We used high-throughput sequencing over four seasons to characterize the 
      rhizosphere microbiome of C. oleifera (Rhizo-Sus) and C. yuhsienensis (Rhizo-Res) 
      and of the bulk soil control (BulkS). In Rhizo-Res, bacterial richness and 
      diversity (Shannon index) in autumn and winter were both higher than that in 
      Rhizo-Sus. In Rhizo-Res, fungal richness in autumn and winter and diversity in 
      summer, autumn, and winter were higher than that in Rhizo-Sus. The seasonal 
      variations in bacterial community structure were different, while that of fungal 
      community structure were similar between Rhizo-Res and Rhizo-Sus. Gram-positive, 
      facultatively anaerobic, and stress-tolerant bacteria were the dominant groups in 
      Rhizo-Sus, while Gram-negative bacteria were the dominant group in Rhizo-Res. The 
      significant differences in bacterial and fungal functions between Rhizo-Sus and 
      Rhizo-Res were as follows: (1) in Rhizo-Sus, there were three bacterial and four 
      fungal groups with plant growth promoting potentials, such as Brevibacterium 
      epidermidis and Oidiodendron maius, and one bacterium and three fungi with 
      pathogenic potentials, such as Gryllotalpicola sp. and Cyphellophora sessilis; 
      (2) in Rhizo-Res, there were also three bacteria and four fungal groups with 
      plant-growth-promoting potentials (e.g., Acinetobacter lwoffii and Cenococcum 
      geophilum) but only one phytopathogen (Schizophyllum commune). In summary, the 
      rhizosphere microbiome of disease-resistant C. yuhsienensis is characterized by a 
      higher richness and diversity of microbial communities, more symbiotic fungal 
      communities, and fewer pathogens compared to the rhizosphere of high-yield but 
      disease-susceptible C. oleifera.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Open pit antimony (Sb) mining causes serious soil pollution, and 
      phytoremediation is a low-cost approach to remediate heavy metal contaminated 
      soil. Rhizosphere bacteria play an important role in ecological restoration in 
      mining areas. There is a knowledge gap on how to find suitable rhizosphere 
      microorganisms to improve the phytoremediation effect. Understanding the 
      differences of rhizosphere bacterial diversity in different restoration stages is 
      helpful to find suitable bacteria for ecological restoration. METHODS: A method 
      of the substitution of "space" for "time" was used to study the effect of natural 
      restoration on rhizosphere bacterial community. According to the dominant 
      vegetation types (herb, shrub, and tree) in the natural restoration area of Sb 
      mining, the early restoration (ER), middle restoration (MR), and later 
      restoration (LR) from the largest Sb mine (Xikuangshan mine) in the world were 
      selected to evaluate the differences in the composition and diversity of 
      rhizosphere bacteria during three natural restoration stages. Each restoration 
      stage had five samples. To determine the relationship between restoration stages 
      and bacterial diversity in the rhizosphere, high throughput sequencing of PCR 
      amplified were used. RESULTS: Alpha diversity, as assessed by Chao indices, 
      appeared lowest in ER but this trend was not seen with other diversity metrics, 
      including the Simpson and Shannon. Beta diversity analysis suggested there were 
      differences in rhizobacterial community structure associate with restoration 
      stage. At the phylum level, natural restoration led to a significant increase in 
      the relative abundance of Actinobacteria in the MR, and a significant decrease in 
      the relative abundance of Patescibacteria in the LR. Additionally, 
      Calditrichaeota, Deferribacteres and Epsilonbacteraeota were only found in ER. At 
      the genus level, the relative abundance of RB41 and Haliangium were highest in LR 
      plots, while that of Bacillus and Gaiella were highest in ER plots. Additionally, 
      the Azorhizobium genus was only detected in the ER phase. Overall, our findings 
      suggested that several rhizosphere microbial communities had significant 
      differences among three natural restoration stages (ER, MR, and LR) and the 
      rhizosphere bacterial communities mainly appeared in the early restoration stage 
      can be preferred for remediation of pollution soil in Xikuangshan.

AB  - Autotrophic nitrification is regulated by canonical ammonia-oxidizing archaea 
      (AOA) and bacteria (AOB) and nitrite-oxidizing bacteria (NOB). To date, most 
      studies have focused on the role of canonical ammonia oxidizers in nitrification 
      while neglecting the NOB. In order to understand the impacts of combined biochar 
      and chemical fertilizer addition on nitrification and associated nitrifiers in 
      plant rhizosphere soil, we collected rhizosphere soil from a maize field under 
      four different treatments: no fertilization (CK), biochar (B), chemical nitrogen 
      (N) + phosphorus (P) + potassium (K) fertilizers (NPK), and biochar + NPK 
      fertilizers (B + NPK). The potential nitrification rate (PNR), community 
      abundances, and structures of AOA, AOB, complete ammonia-oxidizing bacteria 
      (Comammox Nitrospira clade A), and Nitrobacter- and Nitrospira-like NOB were 
      measured. Biochar and/or NPK additions increased soil pH and nutrient contents in 
      rhizosphere soil. B, NPK, and B + NPK treatments significantly stimulated PNR and 
      abundances of AOB, Comammox, and Nitrobacter- and Nitrospira-like NOB, with the 
      highest values observed in the B + NPK treatment. Pearson correlation and random 
      forest analyses predicted more importance of AOB, Comammox Nitrospira clade A, 
      and Nitrobacter- and Nitrospira-like NOB abundances over AOA on PNR. Biochar 
      and/or NPK additions strongly altered whole nitrifying community structures. 
      Redundancy analysis (RDA) showed that nitrifying community structures were 
      significantly affected by pH and nutrient contents. This research shows that 
      combined application of biochar and NPK fertilizer has a positive effect on 
      improving soil nitrification by affecting communities of AOB and NOB in 
      rhizosphere soil. These new revelations, especially as they related to 
      understudied NOB, can be used to increase efficiency of agricultural land and 
      resource management.

      rhizosphere soil of natural and planted Pinus tabuliformis forests on the Loess 
      Plateau, Northwest China].
PG  - 3097-3106

AB  - To investigate the interaction between Pinus tabuliformis and root microorganisms 
      and its effects on the stability of P. tabuliformis forests, we collected 
      rhizosphere and non-rhizosphere soil from natural and planted P. tabuliformis 
      forests in Huanglong County of Shaanxi Province. The non-rhizosphere soil was 
      used to analyze chemical properties, while the rhizosphere soil was used to 
      isolate and purify phosphorus-solubilizing (organic and inorganic phosphorus) 
      bacteria. We mea-sured the phosphate-solubilizing ability and identified those 
      bacteria using DNA genes sequencing. The results showed that soil total carbon 
      concentration (TC), total nitrogen concentration (TN), carbon:nitrogen (C/N), and 
      nitrogen:phosphorus (N/P) were significantly higher in natural forest than those 
      in the plantation. A total of 20 genera and 65 species of phosphate-solubilizing 
      bacteria were identified in those two forests, with Bacillus, Streptomyces and 
      Pseudomonas as the dominant group. The diversity, richness, and evenness of 
      phosphate-solubilizing bacteria in the natural forest were higher than that in 
      the planted forest, but dominance was lower. Streptomyces was positively 
      correlated with soil TC, TN, C/N and N/P ratios, while Bacillus and Pseudomonas 
      were positively correlated with soil nitrate (NO(3)(-)), ammonium (NH(4)(+)), 
      available phosphorus (AP), and total phosphorus (TP). The solubilizing ability of 
      phosphate-solubilizing bacteria was different between two forest types, 
      indicating that Pseudomonas sp.34-5 shared in two forests had the strongest 
      phosphate-solubilizing ability for calcium phosphate with 11.40 mug.mL(-1) and 
      Bacillus mycoides BF1-5 exclusive to natural forest had the strongest 
      phosphate-solubilizing ability for lecithin with 4.58 mug.mL(-1). The composition 
      and structure of phosphorus-solubilizing bacterial community were different in 
      two forest types, with higher diversity, richness and phosphate-solubilizing 
      ability in natural forest than that in plantation.

TI  - Mycorrhizal roots slow the decay of belowground litters in a temperate hardwood 
      forest.
PG  - 743-755

AB  - There is increasing evidence that plant roots and mycorrhizal fungi, whether 
      living or dead, play a central role in soil carbon (C) cycling. 
      Root-mycorrhizal-microbial interactions can both suppress and enhance litter 
      decay, with the net result dependent upon belowground nutrient acquisition 
      strategies and soil nutrient availability. We measured the net effect of living 
      roots and mycorrhizal fungi on the decay of dead roots and fungal hyphae in a 
      hardwood forest dominated by either sugar maple (Acer saccharum) or white oak 
      (Quercus alba) trees. Root and fungal litter were allowed to decompose within 
      root-ingrowth bags and root-exclusion cores. In conjunction with root effects on 
      decay, we assessed foraging responses and root induced changes in soil moisture, 
      nitrogen (N) availability and enzyme activity. After 1 year, maple root 
      production increased, and mycorrhizal fungal colonization decreased in the 
      presence of decaying litter. In addition, we found that actively foraging roots 
      suppressed the decay of root litter (- 14%) more than fungal litter (- 3%), and 
      suppression of root decay was stronger for oak (- 20%) than maple roots (- 8%). 
      Suppressive effects of oak roots on decay were greatest when roots also reduced 
      soil N availability, which corresponded with reductions in hydrolytic enzyme 
      activity and enhanced oxidative enzyme activities. These findings further our 
      understanding of context-dependent drivers of root-mycorrhizal-microbial 
      interactions and demonstrate that such interactions can play an underappreciated 
      role in soil organic matter accumulation and turnover in temperate forests.

TI  - Subterranean Microbiome Affiliations of Plantain (Musa spp.) Under Diverse 
      Agroecologies of Western and Central Africa.
PG  - 580-593

AB  - Plantain (Musa spp.) is a staple food crop and an important source of income for 
      millions of smallholder farmers in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). However, there is a 
      paucity of knowledge on soil microbial diversity in agroecologies where plantains 
      are grown. Microbial diversity that increases plant performance with 
      multi-trophic interactions involving resiliency to environmental constraints is 
      greatly needed. For this purpose, the bacterial and fungal communities of 
      plantain fields in high rainfall forests (HR) and derived savannas (SV) were 
      studied using Illumina MiSeq for 16S rDNA and ITS amplicon deep sequencing. 
      Microbial richness (alpha- and beta-diversity), operational taxonomic units, and Simpson 
      and Shannon-Wiener indexes (observed species (Sobs), Chao, ACE; P < 0.05) 
      suggested that there were significant differences between HR and SV agroecologies 
      among the most abundant bacterial communities, and some specific dynamic response 
      observed from fungal communities. Proteobacteria formed the predominant bacterial 
      phylum (43.7%) succeeded by Firmicutes (24.7%), and Bacteroidetes (17.6%). 
      Ascomycota, Basidiomycota, and Zygomycota were the three most dominant fungal 
      phyla in both agroecologies. The results also revealed an immense array of 
      beneficial microbes in the roots and rhizosphere of plantain, including 
      Acinetobacter, Bacillus, and Pseudomonas spp. COG and KEGG Orthology database 
      depicted significant variations in the functional attributes of microbes found in 
      the rhizosphere to roots. This result indicates that the different agroecologies 
      and host habitats differentially support the dynamic microbial profile and that 
      helps in altering the structure in the rhizosphere zone for the sake of promoting 
      synergistic host-microbe interactions particularly under resource-poor conditions 
      of SSA.

      Phytophthora cactorum and Rhizospheric Microorganisms.
LID - 10.3390/nano11092274 [doi]
LID - 2274
AB  - We studied the effects of new chemically synthesized selenium (Se) nanocomposites 
      (NCs) based on natural polysaccharide matrices arabinogalactan (AG), starch (ST), 
      and kappa-carrageenan (CAR) on the viability of phytopathogen Phytophthora 
      cactorum, rhizospheric bacteria, and potato productivity in the field experiment. 
      Using transmission electron microscopy (TEM), it was shown that the 
      nanocomposites contained nanoparticles varying from 20 to 180 nm in size 
      depending on the type of NC. All three investigated NCs had a fungicidal effect 
      even at the lowest tested concentrations of 50 microg/mL for Se/AG NC (3 microg/mL Se), 
      35 microg/mL for Se/ST NC (0.5 microg/mL Se), and 39 microg/mL for Se/CAR NC (1.4 microg/mL Se), 
      including concentration of 0.000625% Se (6.25 microg/mL) in the final suspension, 
      which was used to study Se NC effects on bacterial growth of the three common 
      rhizospheric bacteria Acinetobacter guillouiae, Rhodococcus erythropolis and 
      Pseudomonas oryzihabitans isolated from the rhizosphere of plants growing in the 
      Irkutsk Region, Russia. The AG-based Se NC (Se/AG NC) and CAR-based Se NC (Se/CAR 
      NC) exhibited the greatest inhibition of fungal growth up to 60% (at 300 microg/mL) 
      and 49% (at 234 microg/mL), respectively. The safe use of Se NCs against 
      phytopathogens requires them to be environmentally friendly without negative 
      effects on rhizospheric microorganisms. The same concentration of 0.000625% Se 
      (6.25 microg/mL) in the final suspension of all three Se NCs (which corresponds to 
      105.57 microg/mL for Se/AG NC, 428.08 microg/mL for Se/ST NC and 170.30 microg/mL for Se/CAR 
      NC) was used to study their effect on bacterial growth (bactericidal, 
      bacteriostatic, and biofilm formation effects) of the three rhizospheric 
      bacteria. Based on our earlier studies this concentration had an antibacterial 
      effect against the phytopathogenic bacterium Clavibacter sepedonicus that causes 
      diseases of potato ring rot, but did not negatively affect the viability of 
      potato plants at this concentration. In this study, using this concentration no 
      bacteriostatic and bactericidal activity of all three Se NCs were found against 
      Rhodococcus erythropolis based on the optical density of a bacterial suspension, 
      agar diffusion, and intensity of biofilm formation, but Se/CAR and Se/AG NCs 
      inhibited the growth of Pseudomonas oryzihabitans. The cell growth was decrease 
      by 15-30% during the entire observation period, but the stimulation of biofilm 
      formation by this bacterium was observed for Se/CAR NC. Se/AG NC also had 
      bacteriostatic and antibiofilm effects on the rhizospheric bacterium 
      Acinetobacter guillouiae. There was a 2.5-fold decrease in bacterial growth and a 
      30% decrease in biofilm formation, but Se/CAR NC stimulated the growth of A. 
      guillouiae. According to the results of the preliminary field test, an increase 
      in potato productivity by an average of 30% was revealed after the pre-planting 
      treatment of tubers by spraying them with Se/AG and Se/CAR NCs with the same 
      concentration of Se of 0.000625% (6.25 microg/mL) in a final suspension. The obtained 
      and previously published results on the positive effect of natural matrix-based 
      Se NCs on plants open up prospects for further investigation of their effects on 
      rhizosphere bacteria and resistance of cultivated plants to stress factors.

TI  - Phytate and Microbial Suspension Amendments Increased Soybean Growth and Shifted 
      Microbial Community Structure.
LID - 10.3390/microorganisms9091803 [doi]
LID - 1803
AB  - Phytate represents an organic pool of phosphorus in soil that requires hydrolysis 
      by phytase enzymes produced by microorganisms prior to its bioavailability by 
      plants. We tested the ability of a microbial suspension made from an old growth 
      maple forest's undisturbed soil to mineralize phytate in a greenhouse trial on 
      soybean plants inoculated or non-inoculated with the suspension. MiSeq Amplicon 
      sequencing targeting bacterial 16S rRNA gene and fungal ITS was performed to 
      assess microbial community changes following treatments. Our results showed that 
      soybean nodulation and shoot dry weight biomass increased when phytate was 
      applied to the nutrient-poor substrate mixture. Bacterial and fungal diversities 
      of the root and rhizosphere biotopes were relatively resilient following 
      inoculation by microbial suspension; however, bacterial community structure was 
      significantly influenced. Interestingly, four arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) 
      were identified as indicator species, including Glomus sp., Claroideoglomus 
      etunicatum, Funneliformis mosseae and an unidentified AMF taxon. We also observed 
      that an ericoid mycorrhizal taxon Sebacina sp. and three Trichoderma spp. were 
      among indicator species. Non-pathogenic Planctobacteria members highly dominated 
      the bacterial community as core and hub taxa for over 80% of all bacterial 
      datasets in root and rhizosphere biotopes. Overall, our study documented that 
      inoculation with a microbial suspension and phytate amendment improved soybean 
      plant growth.

TI  - The Combination of a Biocontrol Agent Trichoderma asperellum SC012 and Hymexazol 
      Reduces the Effective Fungicide Dose to Control Fusarium Wilt in Cowpea.
LID - 10.3390/jof7090685 [doi]
LID - 685
AB  - The use of synthetic fungicide needs to be gradually reduced because of its 
      adverse effect on human health and the environment. An integrated approach 
      combining fungicides with biological control agents (BCAs) can be used to reduce 
      the fungicide doses, thereby minimizing the risks associated with chemical 
      fungicides. In this study, the combined application of a BCA Trichoderma and a 
      fungicide hymexazol was used to manage the cowpea wilt disease caused by 
      Fusarium&nbsp;oxysporum. The Trichoderma SC012 strain, which is resistant to 
      hymexazol, was screened out and identified as T. asperellum. T. asperellum SC012 
      showed hyperparasitism to F. oxysporum and could penetrate and encircle the 
      hyphae of pathogen on a medium amended or not with hymexazol. When combined with 
      hymexazol, the population density in the rhizosphere soil of cowpea showed no 
      significant difference compared with the treatment Trichoderma used alone. When 
      the concentration of T. asperellum SC012 or hymexazol was halved, their combined 
      application could control cowpea wilt disease more effectively than their 
      individual use. The findings showed that the combination of Trichoderma and 
      hymexazol could reduce the use of chemical fungicide, which is eco-friendly and 
      may be an important part of integrated control of Fusarium wilt in cowpea.

TI  - Mobile forms of carbon in trees: metabolism and transport.
PG  - 458-487
LID - 10.1093/treephys/tpab123 [doi]
AB  - Plants constitute 80% of the biomass on earth, and almost two-thirds of this 
      biomass is found in wood. Wood formation is a carbon (C)-demanding process and 
      relies on C transport from photosynthetic tissues. Thus, understanding the 
      transport process is of major interest for understanding terrestrial biomass 
      formation. Here, we review the molecules and mechanisms used to transport and 
      allocate C in trees. Sucrose is the major form in which C is transported in 
      plants, and it is found in the phloem sap of all tree species investigated so 
      far. However, in several tree species, sucrose is accompanied by other molecules, 
      notably polyols and the raffinose family of oligosaccharides. We describe the 
      molecules that constitute each of these transport groups, and their distribution 
      across different tree species. Furthermore, we detail the metabolic reactions for 
      their synthesis, the mechanisms by which trees load and unload these compounds in 
      and out of the vascular system, and how they are radially transported in the 
      trunk and finally catabolized during wood formation. We also address a particular 
      C recirculation process between phloem and xylem that occurs in trees during the 
      annual cycle of growth and dormancy. A search of possible evolutionary drivers 
      behind the diversity of C-carrying molecules in trees reveals no consistent 
      differences in C transport mechanisms between angiosperm and gymnosperm trees. 
      Furthermore, the distribution of C forms across species suggests that 
      climate-related environmental factors will not explain the diversity of C 
      transport forms. However, the consideration of C-transport mechanisms in relation 
      to tree-rhizosphere coevolution deserves further attention. To conclude the 
      review, we identify possible future lines of research in this field.

AB  - Moso bamboo is considered a potential species for heavy metal (HM) 
      phytoremediation; however, the effect of intercropping on rhizosphere and 
      phytoextraction remains to be elucidated. We comparatively investigated 
      rhizobacteria, soil properties, and phytoextraction efficiency of monoculture and 
      intercropping of Moso bamboo and Sedum plumbizincicola in Cu/Zn/Cd-contaminated 
      soil. Compared with monocultures, intercropping increased the bacterial 
      alpha-diversity indices (Shannon, Chao1) and the number of biomarkers. Intercropping 
      reduced the contents of soil organic matter (SOM), available nutrients, and Cd 
      and Cu in rhizosphere soils, and reduced the Cd and Zn contents in tissues of 
      sedum. By contrast, Cd and Zn contents in tissues of bamboo increased, and the 
      increase of organic acid in root exudates from intercropping could facilitate the 
      HM absorption. The total amount of Cu, Zn, and Cd removed from the soil in 
      intercropping system was 1.2, 1.9, and 1.8 times than those in monoculture 
      bamboo, respectively. The abundances of Proteobacteria, Acidobacteria, 
      Verrucomicrobia and Actinobacteria were higher in intercropping, playing an 
      important role in soil nutrient cycles and HM remediation. These bacterial 
      communities were closely correlated (P < 0.01) with SOM, available nitrogen, 
      available phosphorus, and HMs. The results suggested this intercropping pattern 
      can increase HM removal efficiency from polluted soils.

AB  - Pine wood nematode, Bursaphelenchus xylophilus, as one of the greatest threats to 
      pine trees, is spreading all over the world. Plant microorganisms play an 
      important role in the pathogenesis of nematodes. The phyllosphere and rhizosphere 
      bacterial and fungal communities associated with healthy Pinus koraiensis (PKa) 
      and P. koraiensis infected by B. xylophilus at the early (PKb) and last (PKc) 
      stages were analyzed. Our results demonstrated that pine wood nematode (PWD) 
      could increase the phyllosphere bacterial Pielou_e, Shannon, and Simpson index; 
      phyllosphere fungal Chao 1 index, as well as rhizosphere bacterial Pielou_e, 
      Shannon, and Simpson index; and rhizosphere fungal Pielou_e, Shannon, and Simpson 
      index. What's more, slight shifts of the microbial diversity were observed at the 
      early stage of infection, and the microbial diversity increased significantly as 
      the symptoms of infection worsened. With the infection of B. xylophilus in P. 
      koraiensis, Bradyrhizobium (rhizosphere bacteria), Massilia (phyllosphere 
      bacteria), and Phaeosphaeriaceae (phyllosphere fungi) were the major contributors 
      to the differences in community compositions among different treatments. With the 
      infection of PWD, most of the bacterial groups tended to be co-excluding rather 
      than co-occurring. These changes would correlate with microbial ability to 
      suppress plant pathogen, enhancing the understanding of disease development and 
      providing guidelines to pave the way for its possible management.

TI  - The Nexus between Fire and Soil Bacterial Diversity in the African Miombo 
      Woodlands of Niassa Special Reserve, Mozambique.
LID - 10.3390/microorganisms9081562 [doi]
LID - 1562
AB  - (1) Background: the Miombo woodlands comprise the most important vegetation from 
      southern Africa and are dominated by tree legumes with an ecology highly driven 
      by fires. Here, we report on the characterization of bacterial communities from 
      the rhizosphere of Brachystegia boehmii in different soil types from areas 
      subjected to different regimes. (2) Methods: bacterial communities were 
      identified through Illumina MiSeq sequencing (16S rRNA). Vigna unguiculata was 
      used as a trap to capture nitrogen-fixing bacteria and culture-dependent methods 
      in selective media were used to isolate plant growth promoting bacteria (PGPB). 
      PGP traits were analysed and molecular taxonomy of the purified isolates was 
      performed. (3) Results: Bacterial communities in the Miombo rhizosphere are 
      highly diverse and driven by soil type and fire regime. Independent of the soil 
      or fire regime, the functional diversity was high, and the different consortia 
      maintained the general functions. A diverse pool of diazotrophs was isolated, and 
      included symbiotic (e.g., Mesorhizobium sp., Neorhizobium galegae, Rhizobium sp., 
      and Ensifer adhaerens), and non-symbiotic (e.g., Agrobacterium sp., Burkholderia 
      sp., Cohnella sp., Microvirga sp., Pseudomonas sp., and Stenotrophomonas sp.) 
      bacteria. Several isolates presented cumulative PGP traits. (4) Conclusions: 
      Although the dynamics of bacterial communities from the Miombo rhizosphere is 
      driven by fire, the maintenance of high levels of diversity and functions remain 
      unchanged, constituting a source of promising bacteria in terms of 
      plant-beneficial activities such as mobilization and acquisition of nutrients, 
      mitigation of abiotic stress, and modulation of plant hormone levels.

AB  - Pine wilt disease (PWD) is a deadly disease to pines (Pinus spp.) worldwide. The 
      occurrence of PWD can reduce the relative abundance of root ectomycorrhizal fungi 
      (ECMF) and dark septate endophytes (DSE). However, the effects of exogenous 
      ECMF/DSE inoculation on the rhizosphere microbial community structure of Pinus 
      tabulaeformis infected by pine wood nematode (PWN) is little known. Here, we 
      tested how ECMF/DSE may improve resistance to PWD by quantifying microbial carbon 
      biomass and soil enzymatic activity among different treatments at 6 and 9 months 
      after PWN infection. Denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) was used to 
      study the microbial community structure at 3, 6, and 9 months after PWN infection 
      in the rhizosphere of P. tabulaeformis seedlings inoculated with ECMF/DSE. The 
      results showed that exogenous ECMF/DSE inoculation reduced the disease severity 
      caused by PWN infection. After PWN infection, the rhizosphere microbial carbon of 
      seedlings inoculated with Amanita vaginata, Suillus bovinus, Gaeumannomyces 
      cylindrosporus, and Paraphoma chrysanthemicola was 38.16, 49.67, 42.11, and 
      96.05% higher than that of the control group, respectively. Inoculation of 
      ECMF/DSE inhibited the decrease of rhizosphere microbial biomass caused by PWN 
      infection. The richness and diversity of P. tabulaeformis rhizosphere fungi at 9 
      months were reduced by PWN infection but partially recovered by the exogenous 
      fungi (ECMF/DSE) inoculation except for P. chrysanthemicola, which indicates a 
      role of ECMF/DSE in maintaining stability of the microbial community. Inoculation 
      with ECMF/DSE increased the beneficial bacterial (Thauera sp., Mesorhizobium sp., 
      etc.) and fungal groups (Tomentella ellisii, Wilcoxina mikolae, etc.) of in the 
      rhizosphere. In summary, exogenous ECMF/DSE inoculation could increase P. 
      tabulaeformis resistance to PWD probably by improving the rhizosphere 
      microenvironment.

AB  - Plants growing in nature live in association with beneficial, commensal, and 
      pathogenic microbes, which make up the plant microbiota. The close interaction 
      between plants and their microbiotas has raised fundamental questions about plant 
      responses to these microbes and the identity of the main factors driving 
      microbiota structure, diversity, and function in bulk soil, in the rhizosphere, 
      and in the plant organs. Beneficial microorganisms have long been used as 
      inoculants for crops; the current development of synthetic microbial communities 
      and the identification of plant traits that respond to the microbiota form the 
      basis for rational engineering of the plant microbiota to improve sustainable 
      agriculture.

      Plantations Treated with a Biological Product Are Important Predictors of Crop

AB  - Understanding the effectiveness and potential mechanism of action of agricultural 
      biological products under different soil profiles and crops will allow more 
      precise product recommendations based on local conditions and will ultimately 
      result in increased crop yield. This study aimed to use bulk soil and rhizosphere 
      microbial composition and structure to evaluate the potential effect of a 
      Bacillus amyloliquefaciens inoculant (strain QST713) on potatoes and to explore 
      its relationship with crop yield. We implemented next-generation sequencing (NGS) 
      and bioinformatics approaches to assess the bacterial and fungal biodiversity in 
      185 soil samples, distributed over four different time points-from planting to 
      harvest-from three different geographical locations in the United States. In 
      addition to location and sampling time (which includes the difference between 
      bulk soil and rhizosphere) as the main variables defining the microbiome 
      composition, the microbial inoculant applied as a treatment also had a small but 
      significant effect in fungal communities and a marginally significant effect in 
      bacterial communities. However, treatment preserved the native communities 
      without causing a detectable long-lasting effect on the alpha- and beta-diversity 
      patterns after harvest. Using information about the application of the microbial 
      inoculant and considering microbiome composition and structure data, we were able 
      to train a Random Forest model to estimate if a bulk soil or rhizosphere sample 
      came from a low- or high-yield block with relatively high accuracy (84.6%), 
      concluding that the structure of fungal communities gives us more information as 
      an estimator of potato yield than the structure of bacterial communities. 
      IMPORTANCE Our results reinforce the notion that each cultivar on each location 
      recruits a unique microbial community and that these communities are modulated by 
      the vegetative growth stage of the plant. Moreover, inoculation of a Bacillus 
      amyloliquefaciens strain QST713-based product on potatoes also changed the 
      abundance of specific taxonomic groups and the structure of local networks in 
      those locations where the product caused an increase in the yield. The data 
      obtained, from in-field assays, allowed training a predictive model to estimate 
      the yield of a certain block, identifying microbiome variables-especially those 
      related to microbial community structure-even with a higher predictive power than 
      the geographical location of the block (that is, the principal determinant of 
      microbial beta-diversity). The methods described here can be replicated to fit 
      new models in any other crop and to evaluate the effect of any agricultural input 
      in the composition and structure of the soil microbiome.

AB  - Ancylobacter pratisalsi sp. nov. strain E130(T) is a Gram-negative, nonmotile, 
      aerobic, and rod-shaped bacterium that was recently isolated from the rhizosphere 
      of Plantago winteri Wirtg. from a natural salt meadow. This strain was described 
      as novel species in genus Ancylobacter; however, information about its complete 
      genome has yet not been reported. In this study, its genome was completely 
      sequenced by PacBio SMRT cell platform, analyzed, and compared with other 
      selected complete genome sequences of Ancylobacter to elucidate its potential 
      plant growth promotion abilities. The genomic analysis revealed that the genome 
      of strain E130(T) consists of one circular DNA chromosome of 4,618,530 bp with a 
      GC content of 66% and one plasmid of 159,741 bp with a GC content of 64.13%. The 
      entire genome contains 4,322 predicted coding genes, 49 transfer RNAs, and 6 
      ribosomal RNA genes. Genome analysis identified a siderophore natural product 
      biosynthesis cluster, which produces fuscachelin. Knockout of several key genes 
      in this cluster significantly reduces the plant-growth-promotion ability of the 
      strain E130(T). In addition to plant-growth promotion, the strain E130(T) can 
      grow well on 5% NaCl (wt/vol), indicating that this strain is a potential 
      bioresource for successful production of economic crops in alkaline soil.

TI  - Root Functional Trait and Soil Microbial Coordination: Implications for Soil 
      Respiration in Riparian Agroecosystems.
PG  - 681113

LID - 681113
AB  - Predicting respiration from roots and soil microbes is important in agricultural 
      landscapes where net flux of carbon from the soil to the atmosphere is of large 
      concern. Yet, in riparian agroecosystems that buffer aquatic environments from 
      agricultural fields, little is known on the differential contribution of CO(2) 
      sources nor the systematic patterns in root and microbial communities that relate 
      to these emissions. We deployed a field-based root exclusion experiment to 
      measure heterotrophic and autotrophic-rhizospheric respiration across riparian 
      buffer types in an agricultural landscape in southern Ontario, Canada. We paired 
      bi-weekly measurements of in-field CO(2) flux with analysis of soil properties 
      and fine root functional traits. We quantified soil microbial community structure 
      using qPCR to estimate bacterial and fungal abundance and characterized microbial 
      diversity using high-throughput sequencing. Mean daytime total soil respiration 
      rates in the growing season were 186.1 +/- 26.7, 188.7 +/- 23.0, 278.6 +/- 30.0, and 
      503.4 +/- 31.3 mg CO(2)-C m(-2) h(-1) in remnant coniferous and mixed forest, and 
      rehabilitated forest and grass buffers, respectively. Contributions of 
      autotrophic-rhizospheric respiration to total soil CO(2) fluxes ranged widely 
      between 14 and 63% across the buffers. Covariation in root traits aligned roots 
      of higher specific root length and nitrogen content with higher specific root 
      respiration rates, while microbial abundance in rhizosphere soil coorindated with 
      roots that were thicker in diameter and higher in carbon to nitrogen ratio. 
      Variation in autotrophic-rhizospheric respiration on a soil area basis was 
      explained by soil temperature, fine root length density, and covariation in root 
      traits. Heterotrophic respiration was strongly explained by soil moisture, 
      temperature, and soil carbon, while multiple factor analysis revealed a positive

AB  - This study aimed to determine the transfer of metals (Cd, Pb and Zn) and As to a 
      Mediterranean forest close to five tailings ponds in Cartagena-La Union mining 
      district (SE Spain). In addition, the effect of the rhizosphere of two native 
      plant species, Olea europaea (OE) and Pistacia lentiscus (PL), on soil properties 
      and chemical speciation of metal(oid)s was evaluated. Results showed there was no 
      influence of the rhizosphere in the total concentration of metal(loid)s in soil, 
      decreasing as Pb > Zn > As > Cd. Chemical partitioning revealed that only Cd and 
      As can be considered hazardous, with a high percentage of these elements in the 
      soil-labile fractions (20-40%). The accumulation in vegetal tissues was only high 
      for Pb in PL roots, which makes it a suitable species for phytostabilization. 
      Additionally, translocation factors showed transfer of Pb and Zn in OE, and Zn in 
      PL to aerial parts, although no toxicity evidences for plants or animals were 
      found. Finally, soil properties affected metal(loid)s accumulation in plants. The 
      OE species was related to soil-labile metal(loid) fractions and pH, total N, 
      organic carbon and silt content. The PL species were associated with immobilized 
      metal(loid) fractions, sand content, electrical conductivity and total 
      concentrations of As, Cd and Pb. Hence, mining activity has affected native 
      adjacent soils, with accumulation of metals in plant species, although 
      translocation was low, likely due to physiological strategies of the studied 
      species to protect themselves against hazardous elements, and to the high soil 
      pH, which limits metals' mobility.

AB  - How stoichiometry in different ecosystem components responds to long-term 
      nitrogen (N) addition is crucial for understanding within-ecosystem 
      biogeochemistry cycling processes in the context of global change. To explore the 
      effects of long-term N addition on nutrient stoichiometry in soil and plant 
      components in forest ecosystem, a 10-year N addition experiment using ammonium 
      nitrate (NH(4)NO(3)) was conducted in a bamboo forest in the Rainy Zone of West 
      China, where the background N deposition is the highest in the world. Four N 
      treatment levels (+0, +50, +150, +300 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1)) (CK, LN, MN, HN) were 
      applied monthly since November 2007, and then, the C:N:P stoichiometry of soil, 
      microbial biomass, and enzymes in rhizosphere soil and bulk soil, and plant 
      organs were measured. N addition decreased the stoichiometry of C:N:P of soil, 
      microbial biomass, and enzymes. Soil C:N:P change under N addition treatments was 
      stronger in bulk soil, while C:N:P changes for microbial biomass and enzyme 
      activity were significant in rhizosphere soil. N addition significantly decreased 
      TOC in bulk soil. Changes in MBC:MBN:MBP in rhizosphere and bulk soil were mainly 
      caused by MBN and MBP, and MBP performance was consistent with that of AP. The 
      main variable leading to the change of enzyme C:N:P in rhizosphere soil was BG 
      and AP, and in bulk soil was LAP + NAG activity. Plant root C:P and N:P increased 
      with N addition, while those for leaves and twigs did not. N addition 
      significantly reduced the pH of both rhizosphere and bulk soils. These results 
      suggest that the stoichiometry responses of rhizosphere and bulk soils were 
      different due to the influence of plant roots. Soil acidification, enhanced 
      aluminum toxicity potential, decreased root biomass and enhanced microbial P 
      limitation caused by N addition were the important mechanisms that promoted 
      stoichiometry changes in this ecosystem. Under the chronic input of N deposition, 
      the stoichiometry between plant and soil evolved in different directions, which 
      may lead to the decoupling of plants from soils.

AB  - By maintaining soil structure and quality, soil microbial communities usually 
      play important role in many forest ecosystem processes, including ecological 
      succession. Understanding changes in the microbial communities of areas 
      afforested with stands of different ages is of interest in ecology. Populus alba 
      var. pyramidalis Bunge has been widely planted in Northwest China for ecological 
      restoration. Rhizospheric soil samples were collected from 4-, 9-, 15-, 25- and 
      30-year-old plantations of P. alba to measure soil characteristics and soil 
      microbial community diversity using Illumina MiSeq sequencing. The soil nutrition 
      concentration and enzymatic activities decreased with depth of soil layer 
      increased. In terms of stand age, alkaline phosphatase and dehydrogenase and the 
      contents of nitrate N, available P and soil organic content (SOC) increased 
      gradually. According to Illumina MiSeq sequencing results, the fungal and 
      bacterial community structure varied with stand age, and diversity of fungi was 
      less than bacteria. With increasing stand age, fungal community diversity indexes 
      first increased and then decreased, peaked at 25y or 30y. RDA results suggested 
      that soil available P and nitrate N were the most important factors governing 
      fungal community structure, while available P contributed significantly to the 
      variance of the bacterial community. Structural equation modelling (SEM) results 
      indicated soil available P, nitrate N and SOC contents largely explained the 
      shift in the microbial community structure along the cultivation chronosequence, 
      and soil enzyme activities were related with changes in microbial community. Our 
      results illustrated that the successional changes in microbial communities in the 
      P. alba plantations can largely be attributed to changes in soil nutrition level 
      along the chronosequence.

AB  - Bacterial communities have been identified as functional key members in soil 
      ecology. A deep relation with these communities maintains forest coverture. Trees 
      harbor particular bacteriomes in the rhizosphere, endosphere, or phyllosphere, 
      different from bulk-soil representatives. Moreover, the plant microbiome appears 
      to be specific for the plant-hosting species, varies through season, and 
      responsive to several environmental factors. This work reports the changes in 
      bacterial communities associated with dominant pioneer trees [Tabebuia rosea and 
      Handroanthus chrysanthus [(Bignoniaceae)] during tropical forest recovery 
      chronosequence in the Mayan forest in Campeche, Mexico. Massive 16S sequencing 
      approach leads to identifying phylotypes associated with rhizosphere, bulk-soil, 
      or recovery stage. Lotka-Volterra interactome modeling suggests the presence of 
      putative regulatory roles of some phylotypes over the rest of the community. Our 
      results may indicate that bacterial communities associated with pioneer trees may 
      establish more complex regulatory networks than those found in bulk-soil. 
      Moreover, modeled regulatory networks predicted from rhizosphere samples resulted 
      in a higher number of nodes and interactions than those found in the analysis of 
      bulk-soil samples.

AB  - BACKGROUND: This study examined how rhizosphere fungi influence the accumulation 
      of chemical components in fruits of a small population species of Cinnamomum 
      migao. RESULTS: Ascomycota and Basidiomycota were dominant in the rhizosphere 
      fungal community of C. migao. Pestalotiopsis and Gibellulopsis were associated 
      with alpha-Terpineol and sabinene content, and Gibellulopsis was associated with 
      crude fat and carbohydrate content. There were significant differences in 
      rhizosphere fungal populations between watersheds, and there was no obvious 
      change between fruiting periods. Gibberella, Ilyonectria, Micropsalliota, and 
      Geminibasidium promoted sabinene accumulation, and Clitocybula promoted 
      alpha-Terpineol accumulation. CONCLUSION: The climate-related differentiation of 
      rhizosphere fungal communities in watershed areas is the main driver of the 
      chemical composition of C. migao fruit. The control of the production of 
      biologically active compounds by the rhizosphere fungal community provides new 
      opportunities to increase the industrial and medicinal value of the fruit of C. 
      migao.

TI  - Silica Particles Trigger the Exopolysaccharide Production of Harsh Environment 
      Isolates of Growth-Promoting Rhizobacteria and Increase Their Ability to Enhance 
      Wheat Biomass in Drought-Stressed Soils.
LID - 10.3390/ijms22126201 [doi]

AB  - In coming decades, drought is expected to expand globally owing to increased 
      evaporation and reduced rainfall. Understanding, predicting, and controlling crop 
      plants' rhizosphere has the potential to manipulate its responses to 
      environmental stress. Our plant growth-promoting rhizobacteria (PGPR) are 
      isolated from a natural laboratory, 'The Evolution Canyon', Israel, (EC), from 
      the wild progenitors of cereals, where they have been co-habituating with their 
      hosts for long periods of time. The study revealed that commercial TM50 silica 
      particles (SN) triggered the PGPR production of exopolysaccharides (EPS) 
      containing D-glucuronate (D-GA). The increased EPS content increased the PGPR 
      water-holding capacity (WHC) and osmotic pressure of the biofilm matrix, which 
      led to enhanced plant biomass in drought-stressed growth environments. Light- and 
      cryo-electron- microscopic studies showed that, in the presence of silica (SN) 
      particles, bacterial morphology is changed, indicating that SNs are associated 
      with significant reprogramming in bacteria. The findings encourage the 
      development of large-scale methods for isolate formulation with natural silicas 
      that ensure higher WHC and hyperosmolarity under field conditions. Osmotic 
      pressure involvement of holobiont cohabitation is also discussed.

TI  - Differential Responses of Arbuscular Mycorrhizal Fungal Communities to Long-Term 
      Fertilization in the Wheat Rhizosphere and Root Endosphere.
PG  - e0034921
LID - 10.1128/AEM.00349-21 [doi]
LID - e00349-21
AB  - Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) provide essential nutrients to crops and are 
      critically impacted by fertilization in agricultural ecosystems. Understanding 
      shifts in AMF communities in and around crop roots under different fertilization 
      regimes can provide important lessons for improving agricultural production and 
      sustainability. Here, we compared the responses of AMF communities in the 
      rhizosphere (RS) and root endosphere (ES) of wheat (Triticum aestivum) to 
      different fertilization treatments, nonfertilization (control), mineral 
      fertilization only (NPK), mineral fertilization plus wheat straw (NPKS), and 
      mineral fertilization plus cow manure (NPKM). We employed high-throughput 
      amplicon sequencing and investigated the diversity, community composition, and 
      network structure of AMF communities to assess their responses to fertilization. 
      Our results elucidated that AMF communities in the RS and ES respond differently 
      to fertilization schemes. Long-term NPK application decreased the RS AMF alpha 
      diversity significantly, whereas additional organic amendments (straw or manure) 
      had no effect. In contrast, NPK fertilization increased the ES AMF alpha 
      diversity significantly, while additional organic amendments decreased it 
      significantly. The effect of different fertilization schemes on AMF network 
      complexity in the RS and ES were similar to their effects on alpha diversity. 
      Changes to AMF communities in the RS and ES correlated mainly with the pH and 
      phosphorus level of the rhizosphere soil under long-term inorganic and organic 
      fertilization regimes. We suggest that the AMF community in the roots should be 
      given more consideration when studying the effects of fertilization regimes on 
      AMF in agroecosystems. IMPORTANCE Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi are an integral 
      component of rhizospheres, bridging the soil and plant systems and are highly 
      sensitive to fertilization. However, surprisingly little is known about how the 
      response differs between the roots and the surrounding soil. Decreasing 
      arbuscular mycorrhizal fungal diversity under fertilization has been reported, 
      implying a potential reduction in the mutualism between plants and arbuscular 
      mycorrhizal fungi. However, we found opposing responses to long-term 
      fertilization managements of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi in the wheat roots and 
      rhizosphere soil. These results suggested that changes in the arbuscular 
      mycorrhizal fungal community in soils do not reflect those in the roots, 
      highlighting that the root arbuscular mycorrhizal fungal community is pertinent 
      to understand arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi and their crop hosts' responses to 
      anthropogenic influences.

TI  - Temporal Bacterial Community Diversity in the Nicotiana tabacum Rhizosphere Over 
      Years of Continuous Monocropping.

AB  - Long-term continuous monocropping negatively influences the physicochemical and 
      biological characteristics of cultivated soil, especially for the economically 
      important crop of flue-cured tobacco that is intolerant to continuous 
      monocropping. The underlying mechanism of soil sickness under continuous 
      monoculture and the temporal dynamic changes over the tobacco life cycle among 
      different monoculture time spans remain poorly characterized. In this study, 
      high-throughput sequencing targeting the 16S rRNA gene phylogenetic marker was 
      performed on 60 soil samples of rhizosphere soil from flue-cured tobacco in the 
      replanting, growth and harvest period across 5, 10, and 20 years of a continuous 
      monocropping system. Bacterial community diversity decreased with the increase in 
      duration of continuous monocropping, and the rhizosphere microbiota was highly 
      dynamic in the harvest period. The random forests algorithm identified 17 taxa as 
      biomarkers and a model was established to correlate root microbiota with 
      continuous monocropping time of flue-cured tobacco. Molecular ecological network 
      analysis elaborated the differences and interactions in bacterial co-occurrence 
      patterns under different monocropping systems. The co-occurrence microbial 
      network was larger in size but there were fewer interactions among microbial 
      communities with the increase in continuous monocropping duration. These results 
      provide insights into the changes of flue-cured tobacco root microbiome diversity 
      in response to continuous monocropping and suggest a model for successional 
      dynamics of the root-associated microbiota over continuous monocropping time and 
      development stage. This study may help elucidate the theoretical basis underlying 
      obstacles to continuous monocropping and could contribute to improving guidance 
      for tobacco production.

AB  - Phosphorus-solubilizing microorganisms (PSMicros) play vital roles in helping 
      plants to resist phosphorus (P) deficiency in soils, while their activities may 
      vary with site conditions. The present study investigated the microbial diversity 
      and subsequently screened PSMicro strains from rhizosphere soils at five bamboo 
      forests in subtropical China, among which four were developed in a same stand. 
      The activities of the screened PSMicros were also assessed. The results showed 
      great variation in microbial diversity among different forests. Concomitantly, a 
      total of 52 PSMicro strains were isolated and identified to 10 bacterial genera 
      and 4 fungal genera, with different forest rhizosphere soils containing different 
      PSMicros and/or showing different abundances for a certain PSMicro genus, despite 
      some PSMicros would not grow readily on plates. Different, and even the same 
      microbial genera isolated across the five forests, varied significantly in the 
      amount of P that they solubilized from the medium, which ranged from 18.5 to 
      581.33 mg L(-1) . Among the isolated PSMicros, species of Bacillus, Kluyvera, 
      Buttiauxella, Meyerozyma and Penicillium were preponderant to liberate P from 
      organic and inorganic P pools. This will have implications for biotechnological 
      exploitation of microbes to alleviate P limitation in agricultural and natural 
      systems with a sustainable green ecological approach.

AB  - During and after the green revolution in the last century, agrochemicals 
      especially nitrogen (N) were extensively used. However, it resulted in a 
      remarkable increase in crop yield but drastically reduced soil fertility; 
      increased the production cost, food prices, and carbon footprints; and depleted 
      the fossil reserves with huge penalties to the environment and ecological 
      sustainability. The groundwater, rivers, and oceans are loaded with N excess 
      which is an environmental catastrophe. Nitrogen emissions (e.g., ammonia, 
      nitrogen oxide, nitrous oxide) play an important role in global climate change 
      and contribute to particulate matter and acid rain causing respiratory problems, 
      cancers, and damage to forests and buildings. Therefore, the nitrogen-polluted 
      planet Earth needs concerted global efforts to avoid the disaster. Improved 
      agricultural N management focuses on the synchronization of crop N demand and N 
      supply along with improving the N-use efficiency of the crops. However, there is 
      very little focus on the natural sources of N available for plants in the form of 
      diazotrophic bacteria present inside or on the root surface and the rhizosphere. 
      These diazotrophs are the mini-nitrogen factories that convert available (78%) 
      atmospheric N(2) to ammonia through a process known as "biological nitrogen 
      fixation" which is then taken up by the plants for its metabolic functioning. 
      Diazotrophs also stimulate root architecture by producing plant hormones and 
      hence improve the plant's overall ability to uptake nutrients and water. In 
      recent years, nanotechnology has revolutionized the whole agri-industry by 
      introducing nano-fertilizers and coated/slow-releasing fertilizers. With this in 
      mind, we tried to explore the following questions: To what extent can the crop N 
      requirements be met by diazotroph inoculation? Can N input to agriculture be 
      managed in a way leading to environmental benefits and farmers saving money? Can 
      nanotechnology help in technological advancement of diazotroph application? The 
      review suggests that an integrated technology based on slow-releasing 
      nano-fertilizer combined with diazotrophs should be adopted to decrease nitrogen 
      inputs to the agricultural system. This integrated technology would minimize N 
      pollution and N losses to much extent.

AB  - Pteris vittata (PV) and Pteris quadriaurita (PQ) are reported to hyperaccumulate 
      arsenic (As) when grown in Asrich soil. Yet, little is known about the impact of 
      their unique As accumulation mechanisms on As transformations and cycling at the 
      soil-root interface. Using a combined approach of two-dimensional (2D), sub-mm 
      scale solute imaging of arsenite (As(III)), arsenate (As(V)), phosphorus (P), 
      manganese (Mn), iron (Fe) and oxygen (O(2)), we found localized patterns of 
      As(III)/As(V) redox transformations in the PV rhizosphere (As(III)/As(V) ratio of 
      0.57) compared to bulk soil (As(III)/As(V) ratio of </=0.04). Our data indicate 
      that the high As root uptake, translocation and accumulation from the As-rich 
      experimental soil (2080 mg kg(-1)) to PV fronds (6986 mg kg(-1)) induced As 
      detoxification via As(V) reduction and As(III) root efflux, leading to As(III) 
      accumulation and re-oxidation to As(V) in the rhizosphere porewater. This As 
      cycling mechanism is linked to the reduction of O2 and Mn(III/IV) (oxyhydr)oxides 
      resulting in decreased O2 levels and increased Mn solubilization along roots. 
      Compared to PV, we found 4-fold lower As translocation to PQ fronds (1611 mg 
      kg(-1)), 2-fold lower As(V) depletion in the PQ rhizosphere, and no As(III) 
      efflux from PQ roots, suggesting that PQ efficiently controls As uptake to avoid 
      toxic As levels in roots. Analysis of root exudates obtained from soil-grown PV 
      showed that As acquisition by PV roots was not associated with phytic acid 
      release. Our study demonstrates that two closely-related As-accumulating ferns 
      have distinct mechanisms for As uptake modulating As cycling in As-rich 
      environments.

      of Spartina alterniflora in Beihai City, Guangxi Province, PR China, and 
      characterized using a polyphasic taxonomic approach. GY 10621(T) was positive for 
      catalase and oxidase. Growth occurred at 4-42  degrees C (optimum 30-37  degrees C), at pH 
      5.0-9.0 (optimum pH 7.0) and in the presence of 0-5% NaCl (w/v) (optimum 1-3%). 
      The main menaquinones were MK-9 (H(4)) (92.2 %) and MK-10 (7.8 %). The major 
      cellular fatty acids were anteiso-C(15 : 0) and C(14 : 0). The peptidoglycan was 
      the type A4alpha (l-Lys-Ser-d-Glu). The polar lipids included four 
      phosphoglycolipids, four glycolipids, an unidentified lipid and six unidentified 
      phospholipids. The DNA G+C content of the type strain was 71.7 mol%. On the basis 
      of the results of 16S rRNA gene analysis, the type strain of a species with a 
      validly published name with the highest similarity to GY 10621(T) was 
      Flavimobilis soli KCTC 13155(T) (97.16 %), followed by Sanguibacter suarezii NBRC 
      16159(T) (96.39 %). The calculated results indicated that compared with GY 
      10621(T), the average nucleotide identity (ANI) values of three strains closely 
      related to GY 10621(T) (the two aforementioned type strains and 'S. massiliensis' 
      Marseille-P3815) were 74.18-94.97 %, and the digital DNA-DNA hybridization (dDDH) 
      values were 20.3-60.6 %. The results of 16S rRNA-based and genome-based 
      phylogenetic tree analysis indicated that GY 10621(T) should be assigned to the 
      genus Flavimobilis. On the basis of evidence from polyphasic studies, GY 10621(T) 
      should be designated as representing a novel species of the genus Flavimobilis, 
      for which the name Flavimobilis rhizosphaerae sp. nov. is proposed. The type 
      strain is GY 10621(T) (=CGMCC 1.17411(T)=KCTC 49515(T)).

TI  - Local patterns of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungal diversity and community structure 
      in a natural Toona ciliata var. pubescens forest in South Central China.
PG  - e11331
LID - 10.7717/peerj.11331 [doi]
LID - e11331
AB  - Toona ciliata var. pubescens (Toona in Meliaceae) (Tc) is listed as an endangered 
      species, and there are natural regeneration obstacles due to its long-term 
      excessive exploitation and utilization. Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) can 
      produce beneficial effects for plant growth and natural regeneration. However, 
      the characteristics of the AMF community in natural Tc forests are poorly 
      understood. The Illumina PE250 high-throughput sequencing method was used to 
      study the characteristics of the AMF community in the rhizosphere soil and roots 
      associated with three dominant tree species (Tc; Padus buergeriana, Pb; and Maesa 
      japonica, Mj) in a natural Tc forest in Guanshan National Natural Reserve, South 
      Central China. The results found that Glomeraceae was the most abundant AMF 
      family in the rhizosphere soil and roots. Moreover, the relative abundance of 
      Archaeosporaceae in rhizosphere soil was significantly larger than that in the 
      roots; in contrast, the relative abundance of Glomeraceae in rhizosphere soil was 
      significantly lower than that in the roots (p < 0.05). Regarding different tree 
      species, the relative abundances of Acaulosporaceae and Geosiphonaceae were 
      larger in Mj and Tc than in Pb. AMF operational taxonomic units (OTUs) were 
      1.30-, 1.43-, and 1.71-fold higher in the Tc, Pb, and Mj rhizosphere soil, 
      respectively, than in the corresponding roots. Nevertheless, higher AMF community 
      richness was found in the roots compared to that in the rhizosphere soil based on 
      the Chao index. This finding indicated that AMF of a relatively high aggregation 
      degree were in roots, and more AMF groups with relatively low abundance occurred 
      in the rhizosphere soil, which correspondingly lowered the calculated richness 
      index of the AMF community. A redundancy analysis showed that different soil 
      chemical properties impacted variations in the AMF community characteristics 
      differently. This study has great significance for the interpretation of AMF 
      diversity survey and the application design of AMF in vegetation restoration.

AB  - The soil microbial community (SMC) provides critical ecosystem services including 
      organic matter decomposition, soil structural formation, and nutrient cycling. 
      Studies suggest plants, specifically trees, act as soil keystone species 
      controlling SMC structure via multiple mechanisms (e.g., litter chemistry, root 
      exudates, and canopy alteration of precipitation). Tree influence on SMC is 
      shaped by local/regional climate effects on forested environments and the 
      connection of forests to surrounding landscapes (e.g., urbanization). Urban soils 
      offer an ideal analog to assess the influence of environmental conditions versus 
      plant species-specific controls on SMC. We used next generation high throughput 
      sequencing to characterize the SMC of specific tree species (Fagus grandifolia 
      [beech] vs Liriodendron tulipifera [yellow poplar]) across an urban-rural 
      gradient. Results indicate SMC dissimilarity within rural forests suggests the 
      SMC is unique to individual tree species. However, greater urbanization pressure 
      increased SMC similarity between tree species. Relative abundance, species 
      richness, and evenness suggest that increases in similarity within urban forests 
      is not the result of biodiversity loss, but rather due to greater overlap of 
      shared taxa. Evaluation of soil chemistry across the rural-urban gradient 
      indicate pH, Ca(+), and organic matter are largely responsible for driving 
      relative abundance of specific SMC members.

AB  - Streptomyces sp. HSG2 was isolated from rhizosphere soil of a mangrove forest 
      sample at Qingmei Gang, Sanya. The complete genome sequence of the strain HSG2 
      was obtained using PacBio Sequel HGAP.4 and comprised of 5,282,528 base pairs 
      with a 71.9 mol% G + C content, 4504 protein-coding genes, and 71 RNAs. An 
      in-silico analysis confirmed that genes associated with polysaccharide 
      hydrolyzation, hydrocarbon degradation, and aerobic denitrification were 
      presented in the genome. We also identified 24 natural product biosynthetic gene 
      clusters for secondary metabolites, including those for streptobactin and 
      nystatin A1. The complete genome sequence indicated that Streptomyces sp. HSG2 
      will provide insight into the biosynthesis and regulatory mechanisms for its 
      secondary metabolites, and propose a potential use in biotechnological and novel 
      bioactive natural product biosynthetic applications.

TI  - Bioprospecting of Beneficial Bacteria Traits Associated With Tomato Root in 
      Greenhouse Environment Reveals That Sampling Sites Impact More Than the Root 
      Compartment.

AB  - Tomato is subject to several diseases that affect both field- and 
      greenhouse-grown crops. To select cost-effective potential biocontrol agents, we 
      used laboratory throughput screening to identify bacterial strains with versatile 
      characteristics suitable for multipurpose uses. The natural diversity of tomato 
      root-associated bacterial communities was bioprospected under a real-world 
      environment represented by an intensive tomato cultivation area characterized by 
      extraseasonal productions in the greenhouse. Approximately 400 tomato 
      root-associated bacterial isolates, in majority Gram-negative bacteria, were 
      isolated from three compartments: the soil close to the root surface 
      (rhizosphere, R), the root surface (rhizoplane, RP), and the root interior 
      (endorhizosphere, E). A total of 33% of the isolates produced siderophores and 
      were able to solubilize phosphates and grow on NA with 8% NaCl. A total of 30% of 
      the root-associated bacteria showed antagonistic activity against all the tomato 
      pathogens tested, i.e., Clavibacter michiganesis pv. michiganensis, Pseudomonas 
      syringae pv. tomato, Pseudomonas corrugata and Xanthomonas euvesicatoria pv. 
      perforans, and Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. lycopersici. We found that the sampling 
      site rather than the root compartment of isolation influenced bacterial 
      composition in terms of analyzed phenotype. This was demonstrated through a 
      diversity analysis including general characteristics and PGPR traits, as well as 
      biocontrol activity in vitro. Analysis of 16S rRNA gene (rDNA) sequencing of 77 
      culturable endophytic bacteria that shared multiple beneficial activity revealed 
      a predominance of bacteria in Bacillales, Enterobacteriales, and Pseudomonadales. 
      Their in vitro antagonistic activity showed that Bacillus species were 
      significantly more active than the isolates in the other taxonomic group. In 
      planta activity against phytopathogenic bacteria of a subset of Bacillus and 
      Pseudomonas isolates was also assessed.

AB  - The diversity and interactions of soil fungal community are the key to maintain 
      the diversity and stability of ecosystem. In this study, we examined the 
      structure, diversity and co-occurrence networks of fungal community in 
      rhizosphere and non-rhizosphere soils of planted and natural Picea asperata 
      forests using high-throughput sequencing technique and bioinformatic methods. The 
      results showed that Inocybaceae and Sebacinaceae were dominant family in soils of 
      planted and natural forests, respectively. At the genus level, Inocybe was 
      dominant one in soils of planted and natural forests. There were significant 
      differences in beta-diversity of fungal communities between rhizosphere and 
      non-rhizosphere soils in both planted and natural forests. There were no 
      significant correlations between environmental variables and the relative 
      abundance and alpha-diversity of fungal communities. Herb layer coverage, soil water 
      content, total organic carbon concentration, and plant species richness played 
      important roles in explaining the variations of beta-diversity of fungal 
      communities. Results of the network analysis showed that the negative 
      correlations were dominant among soil fungal communities in natural forest, 
      suggesting that the competition of different groups in natural forest. Moreover, 
      there were more negative correlations in non-rhizosphere soils than in 
      rhizosphere soils, which indicated that fungal communities in non-rhizosphere 
      soils comprised more competitive network structure than in the rhizosphere soils. 
      Biomarker species were identified based on differential abundance analysis. 
      Sebacinaceae was the single shared keystone species in the fungal network which 
      had significant differences among rhizosphere and non-rhizosphere soils of 
      planted and natural forests. Therefore, it is suggested that the variation of 
      differential species in the soil fungal communities between the planted and 
      natural forest might had limited influence on the stability of the community of 
      planted and natural forests.

AB  - In this work, we investigated Bradyrhizobium strains isolated from soils 
      collected from the rhizosphere of native and exotic legumes species inhabiting 
      two ecoclimatic zones - asubtropical-lowland pasture (Pampa Biome) and a volcanic 
      plateau covered by Araucaria Moist Forests (Atlantic Forest Biome). The rhizobial 
      strains were isolated from the nodules of seven native and one exotic legume 
      species used as rhizobium traps. Single-gene (recA, glnII, dnaK) and 
      combined-gene MLSA analyses (dnaK-glnII-gyrB-recA-rpoB) revealed that nearly 85% 
      of the isolates clustered in B. elkanii supergroup, while the remaining (except 
      for two isolates) in B. japonicum supergroup, albeit, in most cases, separately 
      from the type strains of Bradyrhizobium species. As a symbiotic gene marker, a 
      portion of nifD gene was sequenced for 194 strains. In the nifD-tree, an American 
      branch III.3D (104 isolates), was the most numerous among the isolates. A 
      significant portion of the isolates clustered in American groups; subclade III.4 
      (40 strains), Clade VII (3 strains), and a new Clade XX (4 strains). Most of the 
      remaining strains belonged to a pantropical III.3C branch (39 isolates). On the 
      other hand, identification of isolates belonging, respectively, to Clade I and 
      Clade II may result of spreading of the Australian (Clade I) and European (Clade 
      II) bradyrhizobia following the introduction of their legume hosts. Our study 
      indicated that the American groups predominated in the symbiotic Bradyrhizobium 
      communities in southern Brazil. However, there is a significant component of 
      exotic lineages, resulting from the dispersal of pantropical Fabaceae taxa and 
      the introduction of exotic legumes.

AB  - In this study, the effects of three halotolerant rhizobacterial isolates AL, HR, 
      and SB, which are able to grow at a salinity level of 1600 mM NaCl, with multiple 
      plant growth promoting (PGP) traits on some seed and forage quality attributes, 
      and vegetative, reproductive, biochemical and physiological characteristics of 
      wheat plant irrigated with saline water (0, 40, 80, and 160 mM NaCl) were 
      investigated. The ability of halotolerant bacterial isolates to produce PGP 
      traits was affected by salinity levels, depending upon the bacterial isolates. 
      Salinity stress significantly affected the yield, quality, and growth of wheat by 
      modifying the morpho-physiological and biochemical traits of the exposed plants. 
      However, all three bacterial isolates, especially isolate AL, significantly 
      improved the biochemical (an increase in K(+)/Na(+) ratio by 55%, plant P content 
      by 50%, and plant Ca content by 31%), morphological (an increase in stem dry 
      weight by 52%, root dry weight by 44%, spike dry weight by 34%, and grain dry 
      weight by 43%), and physiological (an increase in leaf proline content by 50% and 
      total phenol in leaf by 42%) attributes of wheat and aided the plant to tolerate 
      salinity stress in contrast to un-inoculated plant. Plants inoculated with 
      bacterial isolates showed significantly improved seed amylose by 36%, leaf crude 
      protein by 30%, leaf metabolic energy by 37%, and leaf water-soluble sugar 
      content by 34%. Among the measured PGP and plant attributes, bacterial auxin and 
      plant K content were of key importance in increasing reproductive performance of 
      wheat. The bacterial isolates AL, HR, and SB were identified as Bacillus 
      safensis, B. pumilus, and Zhihengliuella halotolerans, respectively, based on 
      16 S rDNA sequence. The study reveals that application of halotolerant plant 
      growth-promoting rhizobacteria isolated from halophytic rangeland plants can be a 
      cost effective and ecological sustainable method to improve wheat productivity, 
      especially the attributes related to seed and forage quality, under salinity 
      stress conditions.

AB  - Hydrologic shifts due to climate change will affect the cycling of carbon (C) 
      stored in boreal peatlands. Carbon cycling in these systems is carried out by 
      microorganisms and plants in close association. This study investigated the 
      effects of experimentally manipulated water tables (lowered and raised) and plant 
      functional groups on the peat and root microbiomes in a boreal rich fen. All 
      samples were sequenced and processed for bacterial, archaeal (16S DNA genes; V4), 
      and fungal (internal transcribed spacer 2 [ITS2]) DNA. Depth had a strong effect 
      on microbial and fungal communities across all water table treatments. Bacterial 
      and archaeal communities were most sensitive to the water table treatments, 
      particularly at the 10- to 20-cm depth; this area coincides with the rhizosphere 
      or rooting zone. Iron cyclers, particularly members of the family Geobacteraceae, 
      were enriched around the roots of sedges, horsetails, and grasses. The fungal 
      community was affected largely by plant functional group, especially cinquefoils. 
      Fungal endophytes (particularly Acephala spp.) were enriched in sedge and grass 
      roots, which may have underappreciated implications for organic matter breakdown 
      and cycling. Fungal lignocellulose degraders were enriched in the lowered water 
      table treatment. Our results were indicative of two main methanogen communities, 
      a rooting zone community dominated by the archaeal family Methanobacteriaceae and 
      a deep peat community dominated by the family Methanomicrobiaceae. IMPORTANCE 
      This study demonstrated that roots and the rooting zone in boreal fens support 
      organisms likely capable of methanogenesis, iron cycling, and fungal endophytic 
      association and are directly or indirectly affecting carbon cycling in these 
      ecosystems. These taxa, which react to changes in the water table and associate 
      with roots and, particularly, graminoids, may gain greater biogeochemical 
      influence, as projected higher precipitation rates could lead to an increased 
      abundance of sedges and grasses in boreal fens.

TI  - Response of Pine Rhizosphere Microbiota to Foliar Treatment with 
      Resistance-Inducing Bacteria against Pine Wilt Disease.
LID - 10.3390/microorganisms9040688 [doi]
LID - 688
AB  - In this study, two bacterial strains, IRP7 and IRP8, were selected to induce 
      resistance against pine wilt disease (PWD). Foliar application with these strains 
      to nematode-inoculated pine seedlings significantly reduced PWD severity. The 
      effect of nematode inoculation and bacterial treatment on the rhizosphere 
      bacterial community was investigated. The results indicated that the rhizosphere 
      of nematode-inoculated seedlings contained a lower relative abundance of 
      beneficial microbes such as Paraburkholderia, Bradyrhizobium, Rhizobacter, 
      Lysobacter, and Caballeronia. Bacterial treatment resulted in significant changes 
      in the microbes that were represented in relatively low relative abundance. 
      Treatment with IRP7 resulted in an increase in the relative abundance of 
      Nitrospirillum, Bacillus, and Luteibacter, which might be useful for protection 
      against infection. Treatment with IRP8 resulted in an increase in the relative 
      abundance of obligate bacterial predators of the Bdellovibrio genus that were 
      previously shown to control several bacterial phytopathogens and may have a role 
      in the management of nematode-carried bacteria. The selected bacteria were 
      identified as Pseudomonas koreensis IRP7 and Lysobacter enzymogenes IRP8 and are 
      suggested as a potential treatment for induced resistance against PWD. To our 
      knowledge, this is the first report on the effect of foliar treatment with 
      resistance-inducing bacteria on the rhizosphere microbiota.

AB  - Rhizosphere microbiome is one of the main sources of plant protection against 
      drought. Beneficial symbiotic microorganisms, such as ectomycorrhizal fungi 
      (ECMF) and mycorrhiza helper bacteria (MHB), interact with each other for 
      increasing or maintaining host plant fitness. This mutual support benefits all 
      three partners and comprises a natural system for drought acclimation in plants. 
      Cork oak (Quercus suber L.) tolerance to drought scenarios is widely known, but 
      adaptation to climate changes has been a challenge for forest sustainability 
      protection. In this work, ECMF and MHB communities from cork oak forests were 
      cross-linked and correlated with climates. Cenococcum, Russula and Tuber were the 
      most abundant ECMF capable of interacting with MHB (ECMF~MHB) genera in cork oak 
      stands, while Bacillus, Burkholderia and Streptomyces were the most conspicuous 
      MHB. Integrating all microbial data, two consortia Lactarius/Bacillaceae and 
      Russula/Burkholderaceae have singled out but revealed a negative interaction with 
      each other. Russula/Burkholderaceae might have an important role for cork oak 
      forest sustainability in arid environments, which will be complemented by the 
      lower drought adaptation of competitive Lactarius/Bacillaceae. These microbial 
      consortia could play an essential role on cork oak forest resilience to upcoming 
      climatic changes.

AB  - Nitrogen (N) addition has variable effects on chemical composition, function, and 
      turnover of roots with different diameters. However, it is unclear whether N 
      addition has variable effects on greenhouse gas (GHG) emission in rhizosphere 
      soil. We performed N addition (0-9 g N m(-2) y(-1)) experiment in a Pinus 
      tabulaeformis forest and a lab-incubation experiment to determine the effects of 
      N addition on carbon dioxide (CO(2)), nitrous oxide (N(2)O), and methane (CH(4)) 
      emissions in rhizosphere soils of roots with different diameters (very fine 
      roots: <0.5 mm, intermediate fine roots: 0.5-1.0 mm, largest fine roots: 
      1.0-2.0 mm). Nitrogen addition significantly promoted CO(2) emission and CH(4) 
      uptake, with maximum values (CO(2), 623.15 mg C kg soil(-1); CH(4), 1794.49 mug C 
      kg soil(-1)) in the 6 or 9 g N m(-2) y(-1) treatments (P < 0.05). Nitrous oxide 
      emissions were inhibited, with the greatest inhibitory effect in the 9 g N m(-2) 
      y(-1) treatment (48.63 mug N kg soil(-1)). Total phosphorus (TP) content 
      significantly decreased and increased in rhizosphere soil and non-rhizosphere 
      soil after N addition, respectively, while organic carbon (OC), total N (TN), 
      ammonium (NH(4)(+)), and nitrate (NO(3)(-)) contents in rhizosphere soil 
      increased. A greater change in chemical properties occurred in rhizosphere soil 
      of largest fine roots than very fine roots. Carbon dioxide and nitrous oxide 
      emissions in rhizosphere soil among root sizes exhibited similar responses to N 
      addition. While CH(4) uptake was more responsive to N addition in rhizosphere 
      soil with very fine roots than with largest fine roots. Basically, OC, TN, 
      NO(3)(-), and NH(4)(+) were key soil components driving GHG emissions; NO(3)(-) 
      promoted CH(4) uptake and N(2)O emissions, NH(4)(+) inhibited CO(2) emissions. 
      GHG response to N addition varied greatly, particularly in rhizosphere soil with 
      different root sizes mainly related to its chemical properties.

AB  - Thinning can significantly promote forest productivity and ecological function. 
      Rhizosphere fungi play an indispensable role in regulating nutrient cycling 
      between plants and the environment, and their community composition can 
      positively respond to anthropogenic disturbance. However, the initial effects of 
      thinning on rhizosphere fungal community assembly have seldom been reported. In 
      this research, we studied the alterations in the rhizosphere fungal communities 
      of 29-year-old Pinus massoniana in East Sichuan 2 years after three different 
      thinning intensity treatments. In addition, the responses of fungal community and 
      functional group composition to alterations in understory vegetation and soil 
      physiochemical properties were analyzed. Three thinning intensities were set, 
      which were 0 (CK), 25% (LIT), and 50% (HIT), respectively. The results suggested 
      that the richness index and Shannon index of understory vegetation increased 
      significantly with increasing thinning intensity. The alpha diversity indices of 
      rhizosphere fungal community and soil physiochemical properties did not show 
      significant differences among the three treatments. The relative abundances of 17 
      fungal indicator species varied regularly with increasing thinning intensity, and 
      most of them belong to Hypocreales and Eurotiales, indicating that these two 
      orders were potential indicators for different thinning treatments. Rhizosphere 
      fungal community assembly was determined by deterministic process, and it was 
      driven by the diversity of understory vegetation in the initial stage of 
      thinning. The Simpson index and Pielou index of herbs were useful measures of the 
      main environmental factors driving the differentiation of fungal functional group 
      composition. Based on network analysis, thinning resulted in distinct 
      co-occurrence patterns of rhizosphere fungal functional groups. This research 
      elucidates the initial role of thinning in rhizosphere fungal community assembly 
      of P. massoniana and has practical significance for the functional restoration 
      and protection of local forest ecosystem.

AB  - Prokaryotic communities play key roles in biogeochemical transformation and 
      cycling of nutrients in the productive mangrove ecosystem. In this study, the 
      vertical distribution of rhizosphere bacteria was evaluated by profiling the 
      bacterial diversity and community structure in the rhizospheres of four mangrove 
      species (Sonneratia alba, Rhizophora mucronata, Ceriops tagal and Avicennia 
      marina) from Mida Creek and Gazi Bay, Kenya, using DNA-metabarcoding. Alpha 
      diversity was not significantly different between sites, but, significantly 
      higher in the rhizospheres of S. alba and R. mucronata in Gazi Bay than in Mida 
      Creek. Chemical parameters of the mangrove sediments significantly correlated 
      inversely with alpha diversity metrics. The bacterial community structure was 
      significantly differentiated by geographical location, mangrove species and 
      sampling depth, however, differences in mangrove species and sediment chemical 
      parameters explained more the variation in bacterial community structure. 
      Proteobacteria (mainly Deltaproteobacteria and Gammaproteobacteria) was the 
      dominant phylum while the families Desulfobacteraceae, Pirellulaceae and 
      Syntrophobacteraceae were dominant in both study sites and across all mangrove 
      species. Constrained redundancy analysis indicated that calcium, potassium, 
      magnesium, electrical conductivity, pH, nitrogen, sodium, carbon and salinity 
      contributed significantly to the species-environment relationship. Predicted 
      functional profiling using PICRUSt2 revealed that pathways for sulfur and carbon 
      metabolism were significantly enriched in Gazi Bay than Mida Creek. Overall, the 
      results indicate that bacterial community composition and their potential 
      function are influenced by mangrove species and a fluctuating influx of nutrients 
      in the mangrove ecosystems of Gazi Bay and Mida Creek.

AB  - Tree regeneration is significantly affected by water deficiency, which could be 
      alleviated by the inoculation of Trichoderma spp. In this study, the effects of 
      rhizosphere inoculation with Trichoderma spp. on the antioxidant system and 
      osmotic substances in the seedlings of Larix principis-rupprechtii was 
      investigated under experimental drought stresses, with the relative water content 
      50%-60%, 35%-50%, and 20%-35% as the light, moderate and severe drought stress, 
      respectively. The results showed that, with increasing drought stress, the 
      activities of protective enzymes, SOD and POD in the needles of seedlings were 
      significantly promoted, the contents of MDA and proline were remarkably 
      increased, whereas the contents of soluble protein and starch showed a decreasing 
      trend. Inoculation with Trichoderma spp. promoted much stronger increase in the 
      activities of SOD and POD in the needles, yet the MDA content showed a lower 
      level of increase. Under moderate drought, the activity of POD in the seedling 
      inoculated with Trichoderma spp. was 1.8 folds of that in the control, while the 
      content of MDA was 62.9% of the control. The contents of proline, soluble 
      protein, soluble sugar, and starch in the inoculated seedlings were higher than 
      that in the uninoculated seedlings. Drought-resistance of L. 
      principis-rupprechtii seedlings inoculated by Trichoderma spp. was significantly 
      enhanced due to the augmenting regulation of antioxidant system and osmotic 
      adjustment substances. Therefore, under the trend of warming and drying in North 
      China, the technique of rhizosphere inoculation of Trichoderma spp. could be 
      popularized for forest plantation or understory tending.

TI  - Drought alters the carbon footprint of trees in soils-tracking the 
      spatio-temporal fate of (13) C-labelled assimilates in the soil of an old-growth 
      pine forest.

AB  - Above and belowground compartments in ecosystems are closely coupled on daily to 
      annual timescales. In mature forests, this interlinkage and how it is impacted by 
      drought is still poorly understood. Here, we pulse-labelled 100-year-old trees 
      with (13) CO(2) within a 15-year-long irrigation experiment in a naturally dry 
      pine forest to quantify how drought regime affects the transfer and use of 
      assimilates from trees to the rhizosphere and associated microbial communities. 
      It took 4 days until new (13) C-labelled assimilates were allocated to the 
      rhizosphere. One year later, the (13) C signal of the 3-h long pulse labelling 
      was still detectable in stem and soil respiration, which provides evidence that 
      parts of the assimilates are stored in trees before they are used for metabolic 
      processes in the rhizosphere. Irrigation removing the natural water stress 
      reduced the mean C residence time from canopy uptake until soil respiration from 
      89 to 40 days. Moreover, irrigation increased the amount of assimilates 
      transferred to and respired in the soil within the first 10 days by 370%. A small 
      precipitation event rewetting surface soils altered this pattern rapidly and 
      reduced the effect size to +35%. Microbial biomass incorporated 46 +/- 5% and 
      31 +/- 7% of the C used in the rhizosphere in the dry control and irrigation 
      treatment respectively. Mapping the spatial distribution of soil-respired (13) 
      CO(2) around the 10 pulse-labelled trees showed that tree rhizospheres extended 
      laterally 2.8 times beyond tree canopies, implying that there is a strong overlap 
      of the rhizosphere among adjacent trees. Irrigation increased the rhizosphere 
      area by 60%, which gives evidence of a long-term acclimation of trees and their 
      rhizosphere to the drought regime. The moisture-sensitive transfer and use of C 
      in the rhizosphere has consequences for C allocation within trees, soil microbial 
      communities and soil carbon storage.

AB  - The natural forest and artificial shed are the main cropping modes of Coptis 
      chinensis. This study is aimed to reveal the rhizosphere soil bacterial community 
      structure difference between under tow C. chinensis cropping modes-natural forest 
      and artificial shed, and to assist us to completely understand soil quality 
      condition,and provide theoretical guidance for soil improvement and C. chinensis 
      planting. The rhizosphere soil samples of 1-5-year-old C. chinensis under tow 
      cropping modes-natural forest and artificial shed were collected. Illumina 
      high-throughput sequencing technology was used to analyze the alpha diversity, 
      community composition, community structure of soil bacteria under the tow 
      cropping modes,and the effects of soil nutriment indices on soil bacterial 
      community structure. Through the analysis of species number, Shannon, Chao1 index 
      and ACE index of bacterial community, it was found that the bacterial diversity 
      of 1-year-old C. chinensis soil under natural forest cropping mode was 
      significantly lower than that under artificial shed cropping mode, and the 
      diversity of bacterial communities in soil of 2-5-years old C. chinensis were not 
      significant different between two cropping modes. A total of 53 phyla,60 
      classes,140 orders and 266 families were detected in the rhizosphere soil of C. 
      chinensis under the cropping modes of natural forest, respectively. The 
      rhizosphere soil of C. chinensis under the cropping modes of artificial shed 
      included 54 phyla,65 classes,140 orders and 264 families, respectively. Under the 
      two cropping modes, the top 10 dominant species of bacterial community abundance 
      are the same, they are Proteobacteria, Acidobacteria, 
      Actinobacteria,Bacteroidetes, Planctomycetes, Chloroflexi, Verrucomicrobia, 
      Gemmatimonadetes, Firmicutes and Cyanobacteria, but there are differences in the 
      abundance sequence. The top 10 dominant species of bacterial community abundance 
      accounted for 74.36% to 74.30% of the total bacteria, and 3.15% to 3.92% of the 
      bacteria are unclassified. The results of Metastat analysis showed that the 
      abundance of Gemmatimonadetes in the rhizosphere soil of C. chinensis under the 
      cropping modes the artificial shed was significantly higher than that under the 
      natural forest cropping mode(P&lt;0.05). MRPP analysis of community structure 
      differences showed that under tow cropping modes, there were significant 
      differences in the bacterial community structure of 1-4-year-old soil bacteria, 
      among which the difference between 1-year-old soil samples was the largest. With 
      the increase of cropping years, the difference gradually decreases, and there is 
      no significant difference in the bacterial community structure between 5-year-old 
      soil samples. RDA analysis and correlation analysis of bacterial community 
      structure and soil physical and chemical properties showed that the order of 
      environmental factors on the rhizosphere soil bacteria of Coptis chinensis was: 
      pH&gt;available P&gt; total P&gt; total K&gt;bulk density&gt;total N&gt;available 
      N&gt;organic matter. The results are helpful to understand the soil health of C. 
      chinensis and provide scientific basis and theoretical guidance for soil 
      improvement and C. chinensis planting.

AB  - Some plant species develop aerenchyma to avoid anaerobic environments. In 
      Syzygium kunstleri (King) Bahadur & R. C. Gaur, both primary and secondary 
      aerenchyma were observed in adventitious roots under hypoxic conditions. We 
      clarified the function of and relationship between primary and secondary 
      aerenchyma. To understand the function of primary and secondary aerenchyma in 
      adventitious roots, we measured changes in primary and secondary aerenchyma 
      partial pressure of oxygen (pO(2)) after injecting nitrogen (N(2)) into the stem 
      0-3 cm above the water surface using Clark-type oxygen microelectrodes. Following 
      N(2) injection, a decrease in pO(2) was observed in the primary aerenchyma, 
      secondary aerenchyma, and rhizosphere. Oxygen concentration in the primary 
      aerenchyma, secondary aerenchyma, and rhizosphere also decreased after the 
      secondary aerenchyma was removed from near the root base. The primary and 
      secondary aerenchyma are involved in oxygen transport, and in adventitious roots, 
      they participate in the longitudinal movement of oxygen from the root base to 
      root tip. As cortex collapse occurs from secondary growth, the secondary 
      aerenchyma may support or replace the primary aerenchyma as the main oxygen 
      transport system under hypoxic conditions.

AB  - Phosphate-solubilizing bacteria (PSB) have beneficial effects on plant health and 
      soil composition. To date, studies of PSB in soil have largely been performed 
      under field or greenhouse conditions. However, less is known about the impact of 
      introducing indigenous PSB in the field, including their effects on the local 
      microbial community. In this study, we conducted greenhouse and field experiments 
      to explore the effects of the addition of indigenous PSB on the growth of Chenmou 
      elm (Ulmus chenmoui) and on the diversity and composition of the bacterial 
      community in the soil. We obtained four bacterial isolates with the highest 
      phosphate-solubilizing activity: UC_1 (Pseudomonas sp.), UC_M (Klebsiella sp.), 
      UC_J (Burkholderia sp.), and UC_3 (Chryseobacterium sp.). Sequencing on the 
      Illumina MiSeq platform showed that the inoculated PSB did not become the 
      dominant strains in the U. chenmoui rhizosphere. However, the soil bacterial 
      community structure was altered by the addition of these PSB. The relative 
      abundance of Chloroflexi decreased significantly in response to PSB application 
      in all treatment groups, whereas the populations of several bacteria, including 
      Proteobacteria and Bacteroidetes, increased. Network analysis indicated that 
      Chloroflexi was the most strongly negatively correlated with Proteobacteria, 
      whereas Proteobacteria was strongly positively correlated with Bacteroidetes. Our 
      findings indicate that inoculation with PSB (UC_1, UC_M, UC_J, and UC_3) can 
      improve the growth of U. chenmoui and regulate its rhizosphere microbial 
      community. Therefore, inoculation with these bacterial strains could promote the 
      efficient cultivation and production of high-quality plant materials.

TI  - Asymbiotic nitrogen fixation in the phyllosphere of the Amazon forest: Changing 
      nitrogen cycle paradigms.

AB  - Biological nitrogen fixation is a key process for the maintenance of natural 
      ecosystems productivity. In tropical forests, the contribution of asymbiotic 
      nitrogen fixation (ANF) to the nitrogen (N) input has been underestimated, even 
      though few studies have shown that ANF may be as important as symbiotic nitrogen 
      fixation in such environments. The inputs and abiotic modulators of ANF in the 
      Amazon forest are not completely understood. Here, we determined ANF rates and 
      estimated the N inputs from ANF in the phyllosphere, litter and rhizospheric soil 
      of nine tree species in the Amazon forest over time, including an extreme drought 
      period induced by the El Nino-Southern Oscillation. Our data showed that ANF 
      rates in the phyllosphere were 2.8- and 17.6-fold higher than in the litter and 
      rhizospheric soil, respectively, and was highly dependent on tree taxon. Sampling 
      time was the major factor modulating ANF in all forest compartments. At the 
      driest period, ANF rates were approximately 1.8-fold and 13.1-fold higher than at 
      periods with higher rainfall, before and after the extreme drought period, 
      respectively. Tree species was a key modulator of ANF in the phyllosphere, as 
      well as N and Vanadium concentrations. Carbon, molybdenum and vanadium 
      concentrations were significant modulators of ANF in the litter. Based on ANF 
      rates at the three sampling times, we estimated that the N input in the Amazon 
      forest through ANF in the phyllosphere, litter and rhizospheric soil, was between 
      0.459 and 0.714 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1). Our results highlight the importance of ANF 
      in the phyllosphere for the N input in the Amazon forest, and suggest that 
      changes in the patterns of ANF driven by large scale climatic events may impact 
      total N inputs and likely alter forest productivity.

AB  - The capacity of four bacterial strains isolated from productive soil potato 
      fields to solubilize tricalcium phosphate on Pikovskaya agar or in a liquid 
      medium was evaluated. A bacterial strain was selected to evaluate in vitro 
      capacity of plant-growth promotion on Solanum tuberosum L. culture. Bacterial 
      strain A3 showed the highest value of phosphate solubilization, reaching a 20 
      mm-diameter halo and a concentration of 350 mg/l on agar and in a liquid medium, 
      respectively. Bacterial strain A3 was identified by 16S rDNA analysis as Bacillus 
      pumilus with 98% identity; therefore, it is the first report for Bacillus pumilus 
      as phosphate solubilizer. Plant-growth promotion assayed by in vitro culture of 
      potato microplants showed that the addition of bacterial strain A3 increased root 
      and stems length after 28 days. It significantly increased stem length by 79.3%, 
      and duplicated the fresh weight of control microplants. In this paper, results 
      reported regarding phosphorus solubilization and growth promotion under in vitro 
      conditions represent a step forward in the use of innocuous bacterial strain 
      biofertilizer on potato field cultures.

AB  - There is increasing attention being paid to utilizing microbial communities to 
      improve plant health while reducing management inputs. Thus, the objectives of 
      this research were to assess changes in the rhizosphere bacterial community 
      structure associated with long-term turfgrass monoculture and to demonstrate the 
      feasibility of using functional bacteria as beneficial biocontrol agents. Large 
      patch disease, caused by the fungal pathogen Rhizoctonia solani AG2-2, is a 
      significant threat to turfgrass cultivation. Rhizosphere samples were collected 
      from 2-, 13- and 25-year turfgrass (Zoysia japonica) monocultures. The 13-year 
      monoculture field had a higher pathogen population density than both the 2- and 
      25-year monoculture fields. Analyses of the rhizosphere bacterial communities 
      revealed that Streptomyces was dominant in the 2-year field and Burkholderia was 
      enriched in the 25-year field. Based on the culturable rhizosphere bacteria, 
      Streptomyces neyagawaensis J6 and Burkholderia vietnamiensis J10 were obtained 
      from the 2- and 25-year fields, respectively. Application of S. neyagawaensis J6 
      and B. vietnamiensis J10 led to excellent inhibition of large patch disease as 
      well as enhanced tolerance against drought and temperature stresses. The results 
      showed that the selected bacteria could be developed as biocontrol and abiotic 
      stress tolerance agents for turfgrass cultivation.

AB  - The aim of this study was to determine the influence of heavy metals on 
      biological soil quality assessments in Vaccinium myrtillus L. rhizosphere soil as 
      well as in non-rhizosphere soil from different polluted sites. The presented 
      study was also conducted in order to determine any differences in the soil 
      physicochemical and biological properties between the Vaccinium rhizosphere soil 
      and the non-rhizosphere soil. The content of heavy metals and their potential 
      bioavailability, content of macronutrients, physicochemical soil properties, 
      activity of six soil enzymes and microarthropod communities were determined. Soil 
      organic matter, the levels of C, N and all the studied macronutrients and almost 
      all enzyme activity were significantly higher in the rhizosphere soil than in the 
      non-rhizosphere soil. At the most contaminated site, the content of heavy metals 
      was also higher in the rhizosphere soil, but their bioavailability was lower than 
      in the non-rhizosphere soil. The beta-glucosidase and urease activity in the soil 
      correlated most negatively with the examined metals. The levels of two enzymes 
      were also strongly impacted by the organic matter-the C and N levels and pH. The 
      number of microarthropods as well as the QBS (soil biological quality index) and 
      F(EMI) (abundance-based fauna index) were higher in the rhizosphere soil. The 
      bilberry rhizosphere soil had stronger correlation coefficient values between the 
      measured parameters than the non-rhizosphere soil, which suggests that 
      rhizosphere soil is more sensitive and could be used in the monitoring and 
      assessment of forest ecosystems. beta-glucosidase and urease were the most sensitive 
      indicators of the adverse impact of Cd, Zn and Pb. The F(EMI) index seems to be a 
      better indicator than the QBS for identifying differences in soil quality.

      nitrification and carbon mineralization.

AB  - The impacts of metal(loids) on soil microbial communities are research focuses to 
      understand nutrient cycling in heavy metal-contaminated environments. However, 
      how antimony (Sb) and arsenic (As) contaminations synergistically affect 
      microbially-driven ecological processes in the rhizosphere of plants is poorly 
      understood. Here we examined the synergistic effects of Sb and As contaminations 
      on bacterial, archaeal and fungal communities in the rhizosphere of a pioneer 
      plant (Miscanthus sinensis) by focusing on soil carbon and nitrogen cycle. High 
      contamination (HC) soils showed significantly lower levels of soil enzymatic 
      activities, carbon mineralization and nitrification potential than low 
      contamination (LC) environments. Multivariate analysis indicated that Sb and As 
      fractions, pH and available phosphorus (AP) were the main factors affecting the 
      structure and assembly of microbial communities, while Sb and As contaminations 
      reduced the microbial alpha-diversity and interspecific interactions. Random 
      forest analysis showed that microbial keystone taxa provided better predictions 
      for soil carbon mineralization and nitrification under Sb and As contaminations. 
      Partial least squares path modeling indicated that Sb and As contaminations could 
      reduce the carbon mineralization and nitrification by influencing the microbial 
      biomass, alpha-diversity and soil enzyme activities. This study enhances our 
      understanding of microbial carbon and nitrogen cycling affected by Sb and As 
      contaminations.

LID - 76
AB  - Armillarioids, including the genera Armillaria, Desarmillaria and Guyanagaster, 
      represent white-rot specific fungal saprotrophs with soilborne pathogenic 
      potentials on woody hosts. They propagate in the soil by root-like rhizomorphs, 
      connecting between susceptible root sections of their hosts, and often forming 
      extended colonies in native forests. Pathogenic abilities of Armillaria and 
      Desarmillaria genets can readily manifest in compromised hosts, or hosts with 
      full vigour can be invaded by virulent mycelia when exposed to a larger number of 
      newly formed genets. Armillaria root rot-related symptoms are indicators of 
      ecological imbalances in native forests and plantations at the rhizosphere 
      levels, often related to abiotic environmental threats, and most likely 
      unfavourable changes in the microbiome compositions in the interactive zone of 
      the roots. The less-studied biotic impacts that contribute to armillarioid host 
      infection include fungi and insects, as well as forest conditions. On the other 
      hand, negative biotic impactors, like bacterial communities, antagonistic fungi, 
      nematodes and plant-derived substances may find applications in the 
      environment-friendly, biological control of armillarioid root diseases, which can 
      be used instead of, or in combination with the classical, but frequently 
      problematic silvicultural and chemical control measures.

TI  - Differences in microbial community response to nitrogen fertilization result in 
      unique enzyme shifts between arbuscular and ectomycorrhizal-dominated soils.
PG  - 2049-2060
LID - 10.1111/gcb.15523 [doi]
AB  - While the effect of nitrogen (N) deposition on belowground carbon (C) cycling 
      varies, emerging evidence shows that forest soils dominated by trees that 
      associate with ectomycorrhizal fungi (ECM) store more C than soils dominated by 
      trees that associate with arbuscular mycorrhizae (AM) with increasing N 
      deposition. We hypothesized that this is due to unique nutrient cycling responses 
      to N between AM and ECM-dominated soils. ECM trees primarily obtain N through 
      fungal mining of soil organic matter subsidized by root-C. As such, we expected 
      the largest N-induced responses of C and N cycling to occur in ECM rhizospheres 
      and be driven by fungi. Conversely, as AM trees rely on bacterial scavengers in 
      bulk soils to cycle N, we predicted the largest AM responses to be driven by 
      shifts in bacteria and occur in bulk soils. To test this hypothesis, we measured 
      microbial community composition, metatranscriptome profiles, and extracellular 
      enzyme activity in bulk, rhizosphere, and organic horizon (OH) soils in AM and 
      ECM-dominated soils at Bear Brook Watershed in Maine, USA. After 27 years of N 
      fertilization, fungal community composition shifted across ECM soils, but 
      bacterial communities shifted across AM soils. These shifts were mirrored by 
      enhanced C relative to N mining enzyme activities in both mycorrhizal types, but 
      this occurred in different soil fractions. In ECM stands these shifts occurred in 
      rhizosphere soils, but in AM stands they occurred in bulk soils. Additionally, 
      ECM OH soils exhibited the opposite response with declines in C relative to N 
      mining. As rhizosphere soils account for only a small portion of total soil 
      volume relative to bulk soils, coupled with declines in C to N enzyme activity in 
      ECM OH soils, we posit that this may partly explain why ECM soils store more C 
      than AM soils as N inputs increase.

      Nurseries: Focus on Different Tree Species.

LID - 150
AB  - The production of tree seedlings in forest nurseries and their use in the 
      replanting of clear-cut forest sites is a common practice in the temperate and 
      boreal forests of Europe. Although conifers dominate on replanted sites, in 
      recent years, deciduous tree species have received more attention due to their 
      often-higher resilience to abiotic and biotic stress factors. The aim of the 
      present study was to assess the belowground fungal communities of bare-root 
      cultivated seedlings of Alnus glutinosa , Betula pendula, Pinus sylvestris, Picea 
      abies and Quercus robur in order to gain a better understanding of the associated 
      fungi and oomycetes, and their potential effects on the seedling performance in 
      forest nurseries and after outplanting. The study sites were at the seven largest 
      bare-root forest nurseries in Lithuania. The sampling included the roots and 
      adjacent soil of 2-3 year old healthy-looking seedlings. Following the isolation 
      of the DNA from the individual root and soil samples, these were amplified using 
      ITS rRNA as a marker, and subjected to high-throughput PacBio sequencing. The 
      results showed the presence of 161,302 high-quality sequences, representing 2003 
      fungal and oomycete taxa. The most common fungi were Malassezia restricta (6.7% 
      of all of the high-quality sequences), Wilcoxina mikolae (5.0%), Pustularia sp. 
      3993_4 (4.6%), and Fusarium oxysporum (3.5%). The most common oomycetes were 
      Pythium ultimum var. ultimum (0.6%), Pythium heterothallicum (0.3%), Pythium 
      spiculum (0.3%), and Pythium sylvaticum (0.2%). The coniferous tree species (P. 
      abies and P. sylvestris) generally showed a higher richness of fungal taxa and a 
      rather distinct fungal community composition compared to the deciduous tree 
      species (A. glutinosa, B. pendula , and Q. robur). The results demonstrated that 
      the seedling roots and the rhizosphere soil in forest nurseries support a high 
      richness of fungal taxa. The seedling roots were primarily inhabited by 
      saprotrophic and mycorrhizal fungi, while fungal pathogens and oomycetes were 
      less abundant, showing that the cultivation practices used in forest nurseries 
      secured both the production of high-quality planting stock and disease control.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Continuous cropping of ginseng (Panax ginseng Meyer) cultivated in 
      farmland for an extended period gives rise to soil-borne disease. The change in 
      soil microbial composition is a major cause of soil-borne diseases and an 
      obstacle to continuous cropping. The impact of cultivation modes and ages on the 
      diversity and composition of the P. ginseng rhizosphere microbial community and 
      technology suitable for cropping P. ginseng in farmland are still being explored. 
      METHODS: Amplicon sequencing of bacterial 16S rRNA genes and fungal ITS regions 
      were analyzed for microbial community composition and diversity. RESULTS: The 
      obtained sequencing data were reasonable for estimating soil microbial diversity. 
      We observed significant variations in richness, diversity, and relative 
      abundances of microbial taxa between farmland, deforestation field, and different 
      cultivation years. The bacterial communities of LCK (forest soil where P. ginseng 
      was not grown) had a much higher richness and diversity than those in NCK 
      (farmland soil where P. ginseng was not grown). The increase in cultivation years 
      of P. ginseng in farmland and deforestation field significantly changed the 
      diversity of soil microbial communities. In addition, the accumulation of P. 
      ginseng soil-borne pathogens (Monographella cucumerina, Ilyonectria mors-panacis, 
      I. robusta, Fusarium solani, and Nectria ramulariae) varied with the cropping age 
      of P. ginseng. CONCLUSION: Soil microbial diversity and function were 
      significantly poorer in farmland than in the deforestation field and were 
      affected by P. ginseng planting years. The abundance of common soil-borne 
      pathogens of P. ginseng increased with the cultivation age and led to an 
      imbalance in the microbial community.

AB  - Graphene reportedly exerts positive effects on plant root growth and development, 
      although the corresponding molecular response mechanism remains to be elucidated. 
      Maize seeds were randomly divided into a control and experimental group, and the 
      roots of Zea mays L. seedlings were watered with different concentrations (0-100 
      mg/L) of graphene to explore the effects and molecular mechanism of graphene on 
      the growth and development of Z. mays L. Upon evaluating root growth indices, 50 
      mg/L graphene remarkably increased total root length, root volume, and the number 
      of root tips and forks of maize seedlings compared to those of the control group. 
      We observed that the contents of nitrogen and potassium in rhizosphere soil 
      increased following the 50 mg/L graphene treatment. Thereafter, we compared the 
      transcriptome changes in Z. mays roots in response to the 50 mg/L graphene 
      treatment. Transcriptional factor regulation, plant hormone signal transduction, 
      nitrogen and potassium metabolism, as well as secondary metabolism in maize roots 
      subjected to graphene treatment, exhibited significantly upregulated expression, 
      all of which could be related to mechanisms underlying the response to graphene. 
      Based on qPCR validations, we proposed several candidate genes that might have 
      been affected with the graphene treatment of maize roots. The transcriptional 
      profiles presented here provide a foundation for deciphering the mechanism 
      underlying graphene and maize root interaction.

AB  - Managed agricultural ecosystems are unique systems where crops and microbes are 
      intrinsically linked. This study focuses on discerning microbiome successional 
      patterns across all plant organs and tests for evidence of niche differentiation 
      along temporal and spatial axes. Soybean plants were grown in an environmental 
      chamber till seed maturation. Samples from various developmental stages 
      (emergence, growth, flowering and maturation) and compartments (leaf, stem, root 
      and rhizosphere) were collected. Community structure and composition were 
      assessed with 16S rRNA gene and ITS region amplicon sequencing. Overall, the 
      interaction between spatial and temporal dynamics modulated alpha and beta 
      diversity patterns. Time lag analysis on measured diversity indices highlighted a 
      strong temporal dependence of communities. Spatial and temporal interactions 
      influenced the relative abundance of the most abundant genera, whilst random 
      forest predictions reinforced the observed localisation patterns of abundant 
      genera. Overall, our results show that spatial and temporal interactions tend to 
      maintain high levels of biodiversity within the bacterial/archaeal community, 
      whilst in fungal communities OTUs within the same genus tend to have overlapping 
      niches.

TI  - [Variation in fungal community structures in rhizosphere soil of Coptis chinensis 
      with cropping mode under natural forest and artificial shed].
PG  - 5160-5168
LID - 10.19540/j.cnki.cjcmm.20200814.101 [doi]
AB  - This study is aimed to reveal the rhizosphere soil fungal community structure 
      difference of Coptis chinensis cropping between natural forest and artificial 
      shed modes, and provide theoretical guidance for soil improvement and C. 
      chinensis planting. The rhizosphere soil samples of 1-5-year-old C. chinensis 
      under natural forest and artificial shed modes were collected. Illumina 
      high-throughput sequencing technology was used to analyze the community structure 
      and diversity of soil fungi under the tow cropping modes,and the effects of soil 
      nutriment indices on soil fungal community structure. The results suggested that 
      the abundance and diversity of fungal communities in soil of 2-5-year-old C. 
      chinensis were not significant different in both two cropping modes, but it was 
      significantly higher than that in the 1-year-old C. chinensis. Comparing soil 
      samples from the same year-old C. chinensis under the two cropping modes, it was 
      found that there was no significant difference in the abundance and diversity of 
      fungal communities. The fungal community of the rhizosphere soil was different in 
      composition and abundance between tow cropping modes, and between different 
      planting years. The 17 phyla,59 classes and 155 orders,and 17 phyla,59 classes 
      and 157 orders were detected in the rhizosphere soil of C. chinensis under the 
      cropping modes of natural forest and the artificial shed, respectively. 
      Ascomycota, Basidiomycota and Mortierellomycota were dominant phyla in 
      rhizosphere soil, and the average abundance of the 3 phyla accounted for 74.36% 
      and 74.30% of the total fungi. The results of analysis of similarities showed 
      that there were significant differences in the fungal community structure of 
      1-year-old and 2-year-old C. chinensis soil fungi, and there was no significant 
      difference in the community structure of 3-5-year-old samples. Under the natural 
      forest cropping mode, there were significant differences among the samples of 
      different years. Under the artificial shed cropping, there were significant 
      differences in fungal community structure between 1-year-old and 3-5-year-old C. 
      chinensis soil, and between 2-year-old and 3-5-year-old C. chinensis soil. The 
      results of canonical correlation analysis showed that soil pH and soil organic 
      matter content were the main factors affecting the soil fungal community 
      structure. Soil organic matter content was positively correlated with 
      Basidiomycota and Cryptomycota, pH was negatively correlated with Basidiomycota 
      and C. ryptomycota. The planting of C. chinensis has promoted the diversity and 
      abundance of rhizosphere fungal community significantly. For the same year-old C. 
      chinensis soil, abundance of fungal community was no significant difference 
      between two cropping modes. There are significant differences in the rhizosphere 
      soil fungal community structure between tow cropping modes in the first two years 
      of planting. Through the interaction between the rhizosphere and the soil and the 
      continuous selection of the rhizosphere to the fungal community, the fungal 
      community structure tended to be the same between the two cropping modes in 
      rhizosphere soil of 3-5-year old C. chinensis. The soil pH and orga-nic matter 
      content were the main factors affecting the change of fungal community structure.

AB  - Abandoned unrestored mines are an important environmental concern as they 
      typically remain unvegetated for decades, exposing vast amounts of mine waste to 
      erosion. Several factors limit the revegetation of these sites, including extreme 
      abiotic and unfavorable biotic conditions. However, some pioneer tree species 
      having high levels of genetic diversity, such as balsam poplar (Populus 
      balsamifera), can naturally colonize these sites and initiate plant succession. 
      This suggests that some tree genotypes are likely more suited for acclimation to 
      the conditions of mine wastes. In this study, we selected two contrasting mine 
      waste storage facilities (waste rock from a gold mine and tailings from a 
      molybdenum mine) from the Abitibi region of Quebec (Canada), on which poplars 
      were found to have grown naturally. First, we assessed in situ the impact of 
      vegetation presence on each mine waste type. The presence of balsam poplars 
      improved soil health locally by modifying the physicochemical properties (e.g., 
      higher nutrient content and pH) of the mine wastes and causing an important shift 
      in their bacterial and fungal community compositions, going from lithotrophic 
      communities that dominate mine waste environments to heterotrophic communities 
      involved in nutrient cycling. Next, in a greenhouse experiment we assessed the 
      impact of plant genotype when grown in these mine wastes. Ten genotypes of P. 
      balsamifera were collected locally, found growing either at the mine sites or in 
      the surrounding natural forest. Tree growth was monitored over two growing 
      seasons, after which the effects of genotype-by-environment interactions were 
      assessed by measuring the physicochemical properties of the substrates and the 
      changes in microbial community assembly. Although substrate type was identified 
      as the main driver of rhizosphere microbiome diversity and community structure, a 
      significant effect due to tree genotype was also detected, particularly for 
      bacterial communities. Plant genotype also influenced aboveground tree growth and 
      the physicochemical properties of the substrates. These results highlight the 
      influence of balsam poplar genotype on the soil environment and the potential 
      importance of tree genotype selection in the context of mine waste revegetation.

AB  - We explored the impacts of different mixed trees on the improvement of soil 
      microecological environment in rhizosphere of Parashorea chinensis, including 
      pure P. chinensis plantation (WC), mixed P. chinensis and Dalbergia odorifera 
      plantation (WJ), mixed P. chinensis and Eucalyptus urophylla x E. grandis 
      plantation (WA). Soil physical and chemical properties were analyzed. The 
      characteristics and distribution of soil microbes in the rhizosphere were 
      measured by the methods of Biolog-Eco micro plate and phospholipid fatty acid 
      methyl ester (PLFA). Soil water content, soil pH, organic matter, total nitrogen, 
      total potassium content and the activities of sucrase, urease and acid 
      phosphatase in rhizosphere soil of WA were significantly higher than those of WC 
      and WJ, without difference between WC and WJ. There were no significant 
      differences in the contents of nitrate nitrogen, ammonium nitrogen, and available 
      potassium between WA and WJ, which were obviously higher than those in WC. There 
      were significant differences in total phosphorus and available phosphorus 
      contents among the three stands, with an order of WJ>WA>WC. The average color 
      change rate (AWCD), Shannon index, Simpson index, McIntosh index and the 
      utilization of six types of carbon source substrates in microorganisms were the 
      highest in the rhizosphere soil of WA, followed by WJ and WC. Results of 
      principal component analysis showed that carbohydrates, amino acids and phenolic 
      acids were the main carbon sources for microbial utilization. In WA, the PLFA 
      content of rhizosphere soil microorganism, bacteria, fungi and actinomycetes was 
      the highest, followed by WJ and WC. There were significant positive correlation 
      between soil physical and che-mical properties and the microbial characteristics. 
      Combining the physical and chemical properties of soil and the functional and 
      structural characteristics of microbial communities, the mixed P. chinensis and 
      E. urophylla x E.grandis plantation may be most conductive to the improvement of 
      the rhizosphere microecological environment and increase soil available nutrients 
      at the young tree phase of P. chinensis.

AB  - Penicillium, the most common genus plays an important ecological role in various 
      terrestrial and marine environments. However, only a few species have been 
      reported from rhizosphere soil. As part of a project to excavate Korean 
      indigenous fungi, we investigated rhizosphere soil of six plants in the forest 
      (terrestrial habitat) and sand dunes (coastal habitat) and focused on discovering 
      Penicillium species. A total of 64 strains were isolated and identified as 26 
      Penicillium species in nine sections based on morphological characteristics and 
      the sequence analysis of beta-tubulin and calmodulin. Although this is a small-scale 
      study in a limited rhizosphere soil, eight unrecorded species and four potential 
      new species have been identified. In addition, most Penicillium species from 
      rhizosphere soil were unique to each plant. Penicillium halotolerans, P. 
      scabrosum, P. samsonianum, P. jejuense, and P. janczewskii were commonly isolated 
      from rhizosphere soil. Eight Penicillium species, P. aurantioviolaceum, P. 
      bissettii, P. cairnsense, P. halotolerans, P. kananaskense, P. ortum, P. 
      radiatolobatum, and P. verhagenii were recorded for the first time in Korea. 
      Here, we provide the detailed morphological description of these unrecorded 
      species.

AB  - Understanding the succession patterns of microbial community along root growth 
      provides deep insights into interaction between fine roots and microbes. In the 
      study, we investigated this issue using fine roots from poplar trees and grouped 
      these fine roots into three growth stages: newborn white roots (WR), mature 
      yellow roots (YR) and aging brown roots (BR). Root surface traits were observed 
      under a scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Adhered soils on roots of the three 
      growth stages were grouped into the three soil compartments, correspondingly. The 
      16S rRNA and ITS1 region were sequenced for bacteria and fungi inhabiting 
      rhizosphere soils, respectively. Phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA) technology was 
      employed to examine the biomass of bacterial and fungal communities. The 
      anatomical traits of fine roots show apparent differences among the WR, YR and 
      BR. Both bacteria and fungi have 25 dominant genera with a relative abundance 
      over 1%, of which, four genera of the bacteria (Bacillus, Burkholderia, Ralstonia 
      and Dyella) differ in abundance among the WR, YR and BR soil compartments and 
      four genera of the fungi (Fusarium, Chaetomium, Penicillium and Scleroderma) 
      differ in abundance among these soil compartments. The operational taxonomic 
      units (OTUs) showed the highest richness in the WR soil compartment for bacteria 
      and in the YR soil compartment for fungi, indicating a different succession 
      pattern between the bacterial and fungal communities. Furthermore, the biomass of 
      bacterial community is larger than the fungal community according to PLFAs, and 
      both decreased along fine root growth. The total carbon (TC) in the soil 
      increases along root growth while the dissolved organic carbon (DOC) decreases. 
      Redundancy analysis (RDA) shows a close correlation between twelve dominant 
      bacteria genera and the total organic carbon (TOC), the readily oxidizable 
      organic carbon (ROC) and DOC and ten dominant fungi genera with the TOC and ROC. 
      In conclusion, our results indicate that fine roots growth has shaped the 
      composition and structure of root associated bacterial and fungal communities.

AB  - It is widely documented that elevated ground-level ozone (O(3)) has negative 
      effects on tree physiological characteristics, and in return, affects forest 
      ecosystem function. However, the effect may be modified by soil nitrogen (N) 
      availability. Numerous studies have focused on the aboveground part of trees 
      under elevated O(3) alone or in combination with soil N; however, little is known 
      about the response of soil bacterial communities. Here, we investigated the 
      effects of O(3) (charcoal-filtered air, CF, versus ambient air +40 ppb of O(3), 
      E-O(3)), N addition (0 kg ha(-1) yr(-1), N0, versus 200 kg ha(-1) yr(-1), N200), 
      and their combination on rhizosphere soil bacterial communities of hybrid poplar, 
      using an MiSeq targeted amplicon sequencing of the bacterial 16S rRNA gene. 
      E-O(3) significantly decreased bacterial abundance, and N200 significantly 
      decreased the alpha-diversity. The negative impacts of N200 on alpha-diversity were 
      alleviated by E-O(3). Nitrogen and E-O(3)-N200 combination altered bacterial 
      community composition, with a significant increase in the relative abundance of 
      Proteobacteria and Bacteroidetes and a decrease in the abundance of Firmicutes. 
      From an ecological network analysis, E-O(3), alone and in combination with N200, 
      complicated the co-occurrence network of bacterial communities by inducing a 
      microbial survival strategy, shifting the hub species from RB41 to Bacillus and 
      Blastococcus. Conversely, N200 led to simplification and decentralization of the 
      co-occurrence network. These findings demonstrate that the rhizosphere bacterial 
      communities exhibit divergent responses to E-O(3) and N200, suggesting the need 
      to consider the stability of the belowground ecosystem to optimize plantation 
      management in response to environmental changes.

TI  - Rice SST Variation Shapes the Rhizosphere Bacterial Community, Conferring 
      Tolerance to Salt Stress through Regulating Soil Metabolites.

LID - e00721-20
AB  - Some plant-specific resistance genes could affect rhizosphere microorganisms by 
      regulating the release of root exudates. In a previous study, the SST (seedling 
      salt tolerant) gene in rice (Oryza sativa) was identified, and loss of SST 
      function resulted in better plant adaptation to salt stress. However, whether the 
      rice SST variation could alleviate salt stress via regulating soil metabolites 
      and microbiota in the rhizosphere is still unknown. Here, we used transgenic 
      plants with SST edited in the Huanghuazhan (HHZ) and Zhonghua 11 (ZH11) cultivars 
      by the CRISPR/Cas9 system and found that loss of SST function increased the 
      accumulation of potassium and reduced the accumulation of sodium ions in rice 
      plants. Using 16S rRNA gene amplicon high-throughput sequencing, we found that 
      the mutant material shifted the rhizobacterial assembly under salt-free stress. 
      Importantly, under salt stress, the sst, HHZcas, and ZH11cas plants significantly 
      changed the assembly of the rhizobacteria. Furthermore, the rice SST gene also 
      affected the soil metabolites, which were closely related to the dynamics of 
      rhizosphere microbial communities, and we further determined the relationship 
      between the rhizosphere microbiota and soil metabolites. Overall, our results 
      show the effects of the rice SST gene on the response to salt stress associated 
      with the soil microbiota and metabolites in the rhizosphere. This study reveals a 
      helpful linkage among the rice SST gene, soil metabolites, and rhizobacterial 
      community assembly and also provides a theoretical basis for improving crop 
      adaptation through soil microbial management practices.IMPORTANCE Soil 
      salinization is one of the major environmental stresses limiting crop 
      productivity. Crops in agricultural ecosystems have developed various strategies 
      to adapt to salt stress. We used rice mutant and CRISPR-edited lines to 
      investigate the relationships among the Squamosa promoter Binding Protein box 
      (SBP box) family gene (SST/OsSPL10), soil metabolites, and the rhizosphere 
      bacterial community. We found that during salt stress, there are significant 
      differences in the rhizosphere bacterial community and soil metabolites between 
      the plants with the SST gene and those without it. Our findings provide a useful 
      paradigm for revealing the roles of key genes of plants in shaping rhizosphere 
      microbiomes and their relationships with soil metabolites and offer new insights 
      into strategies to enhance rice tolerance to high salt levels from microbial and 
      ecological perspectives.

AB  - DNA modification techniques are increasingly applied to improve the agronomic 
      performance of crops worldwide. Before cultivation and marketing, the 
      environmental risks of such modified varieties must be assessed. This includes an 
      understanding of their effects on soil microorganisms and associated ecosystem 
      services. This study analyzed the impact of a cisgenic modification of the potato 
      variety Desiree to enhance resistance against the late blight-causing fungus 
      Phytophthora infestans (Oomycetes) on the abundance and diversity of rhizosphere 
      inhabiting microbial communities. Two experimental field sites in Ireland and the 
      Netherlands were selected, and for 2 subsequent years, the cisgenic version of 
      Desiree was compared in the presence and absence of fungicides to its 
      non-engineered late blight-sensitive counterpart and a conventionally bred late 
      blight-resistant variety. At the flowering stage, total DNA was extracted from 
      the potato rhizosphere and subjected to PCR for quantifying and sequencing 
      bacterial 16S rRNA genes, fungal internal transcribed spacer (ITS) sequences, and 
      nir genes encoding for bacterial nitrite reductases. Both bacterial and fungal 
      communities responded to field conditions, potato varieties, year of cultivation, 
      and bacteria sporadically also to fungicide treatments. At the Dutch site, 
      without annual replication, fungicides stimulated nirK abundance for all 
      potatoes, but with significance only for cisgenic Desiree. In all other cases, 
      neither the abundance nor the diversity of any microbial marker differed between 
      both Desiree versions. Overall, the study demonstrates environmental variation 
      but also similar patterns of soil microbial diversity in potato rhizospheres and 
      indicates that the cisgenic modification had no tangible impact on soil microbial 
      communities.

TI  - Soil carbon and associated bacterial community shifts driven by fine root traits 
      along a chronosequence of Moso bamboo (Phyllostachys edulis) plantations in 
      subtropical China.

AB  - Moso bamboo (Phyllostachys edulis) is widely considered to be effective in 
      capturing and sequestering atmospheric C, but the long-term effects of extensive 
      management strategies on soil organic carbon (SOC), bacterial communities, fine 
      root (FR, o </= 2 mm) traits, and their inherent connection remain unclear. In this 
      study, we simultaneously measured the SOC content of the bulk and rhizosphere 
      soil fractions, the aggregate stability, the chemical composition of SOC 
      (solid-state (13)C nuclear magnetic resonance [NMR]), the bacterial community 
      structure in the rhizosphere, and the FR morphological traits including biomass, 
      specific root length (SRL), and root length density (RLD) along a chronosequence 
      (stand age of 19, 37, and 64 years) of extensively managed Moso bamboo 
      plantations and in an adjacent secondary forest as a control. The organic C 
      content in both the rhizosphere and bulk soil increased rapidly with plantation 
      age in the 0-20- and 20-40-cm soil layers, accompanied by an increase in the 
      aggregate stability. FR traits including biomass, SRL, and RLD also increased 
      continuously in response to soil C:N:P stoichiometry. All of these traits were 
      significantly correlated with SOC, occluded particulate organic C (oPOC), and 
      mineral-associated organic C (MOC), suggesting that FR traits could drive the 
      soil C sequestration with the plantation age. Further analysis indicated that the 
      microbial biomass C (MBC) content, MBC/total organic carbon (TOC) ratio, and 
      bacterial abundance decreased with the plantation age, and the shift from soil 
      oligotrophy to copiotrophy bacteria were mainly driven by changes in FR traits 
      and SOC properties. Such a reassembly of bacterial communities combined with an 
      increase in root biomass is favorable for the accumulation of stable C functional 
      groups (alkyl C or aromatic C). Our findings indicate that extensive management 
      regimes of Moso bamboo plantations could promote long-term soil C sequestration 
      especially in the rhizosphere by promoting the formation of soil aggregates and 
      organic-mineral complexes and by shifting bacterial community composition, and 
      that these changes can be inferred through changes in the FR traits.

AB  - Microplastics pollution poses a new threat to the environment of intertidal zone. 
      The sea forest, mangrove, has been polluted by a large number of plastic debris 
      worldwide. To fill the gaps in knowledge of mangrove rhizosphere microbes 
      connected with the 'plasticsphere', a semi-controlled in situ exposure experiment 
      for nine different types of microplastics were conducted in mangrove ecosystem. A 
      sign of biodegrading was observed on polyethylene, polyamide 6 and polyvinyl 
      chloride microplastics surface after 3 months exposure. We discovered that the 
      metabolic activities of the dominant bacteria on certain microplastics were 
      related to the specific groups on polymers molecule. The selective colonization 
      may be driven by the chemotaxis of bacteria. Specially, microplastics biofilms of 
      polyethylene, polyamide 6, polyvinyl chloride and expanded polystyrene possess 
      distinctive dominant bacteria assemblages which have great significance in 
      ecosystem processes involving carbon cycle or sulfur cycle. Community of mangrove 
      soil microorganism and microplastic biofilm varies as the seasons changes. As a 
      new niche, microplastics has higher inclusivity to bacteria than surrounding 
      soil. Additionally, pathogens for human beings (Vibrio parahaemolyticus and 
      Escherichia-Shigella) were detected both in microplastics and soil. We stress 
      that the interaction between microplastics and rhizosphere microorganisms may 
      affect the growth and health of mangrove plants. Besides, we point out that 
      mangrove rhizosphere microorganism can be an ideal candidate for 
      plastics-degradation.

AB  - Comparison of total organic carbon(TOC), total nitrogen(TN), total 
      phosphorus(TP), soil microbial biomass carbon(MBC), nitrogen(MBN), 
      phosphorus(MBP) and their stoichiometric ratios measuring from understory 
      planting of Paris polyphylla and Panax japonicus rhizosphere soil with the data 
      of the original forest soil will help us to understand the influence of different 
      planting patterns between soil traits and soil microbial interaction and nutrient 
      cycle characteristics. The results showed that the contents of TOC, TN and MBN 
      were the highest in the rhizosphere soil of P. japonicus, while the highest 
      values of TP, MBC and MBP were found in the rhizosphere soil of P. polyphylla. 
      The changes of TOCratioTN, TOCratioTP, TNratioTP, MBCratioMBN, MBCratioMBP and MBNratioMBP of P. 
      polyphylla and P. japonicus rhizosphere soil compared with the data of the 
      original forest soil were 3.65 and 37.32%,-14.89 and 82.23%,-17.87 and 32.76%, 
      25.67 and-50.60%,-75.95 and-16.33% as well as-80.79 and 69.76%, respectively. TN 
      and TP were significantly correlated with MBN and MBP respectively. Although, 
      monoculture of P. polyphylla and P. japonicus changed soil nutrient level, it did 
      not reach the state of nutrient deficiency. The demands for nitrogen and 
      phosphorus between P. polyphylla and P. japonicus were quite different. According 
      to their different habits, monoculture of P. polyphylla and P. japonicus could 
      change the understory soil traits, resulting in allometric changes in part of 
      soil nutrient stoichiometry and soil microbial stoichiometry, and then the 
      disappearance of internal stability. The variations in the understory soil caused 
      by P. polyphylla and P. japonicus is developing in completely different 
      directions, whether this phenomenon indicates that the two species have less 
      niche overlap needs further study.

AB  - Major losses of crop yield and quality caused by soil-borne plant diseases have 
      long threatened the ecology and economy of agriculture and forestry. Biological 
      control using beneficial microorganisms has become more popular for management of 
      soil-borne pathogens as an environmentally friendly method for protecting plants. 
      Two major barriers limiting the disease-suppressive functions of biocontrol 
      microbes are inadequate colonization of hosts and inefficient inhibition of 
      soil-borne pathogen growth, due to biotic and abiotic factors acting in complex 
      rhizosphere environments. Use of a consortium of microbial strains with disease 
      inhibitory activity may improve the biocontrol efficacy of the disease-inhibiting 
      microbes. The mechanisms of biological control are not fully understood. In this 
      review, we focus on bacterial and fungal biocontrol agents to summarize the 
      current state of the use of single strain and multi-strain biological control 
      consortia in the management of soil-borne diseases. We discuss potential 
      mechanisms used by microbial components to improve the disease suppressing 
      efficacy. We emphasize the interaction-related factors to be considered when 
      constructing multiple-strain biological control consortia and propose a workflow 
      for assembling them by applying a reductionist synthetic community approach.

AB  - Plant-microbe associations are increasingly recognized as an inextricable part of 
      plant biology and biogeochemistry. Microbes play an essential role in the 
      survival and development of plants, allowing them to thrive in diverse 
      environments. The composition of the rhizosphere soil microbial communities is 
      largely influenced by edaphic conditions and plant species. In order to decipher 
      how environmental conditions on a mine site can influence the dynamics of 
      microbial communities, we characterized the rhizosphere soil microbial 
      communities associated with paper birch, speckled alder, and spruce that had 
      naturally colonized an acidogenic mine tailings deposit containing heavy metals. 
      The study site, which had been largely undisturbed for five decades, had highly 
      variable vegetation density; with some areas remaining almost barren, and others 
      having a few stands or large thickets of mature trees. Using Illumina sequencing 
      and ordination analyses (redundancy analysis and principal coordinate analysis), 
      our study showed that soil bacterial and fungal community structures correlated 
      mainly with vegetation density, and plant species. Tailings without any 
      vegetation were the most different in bacterial community structure, compared to 
      all other areas on the mine site, as well as an adjacent natural forest 
      (comparison plot). The bacterial genera Acidiferrobacter and Leptospirillum were 
      more abundant in tailings without vegetation than in any of the other sites, 
      while Bradyrhizobium sp. were more abundant in areas of the tailings deposit 
      having higher vegetation density. Frankia sp. is equally represented in each of 
      the vegetation densities and Pseudomonas sp. present a greater relative abundance 
      in boreal forest. Furthermore, alder rhizosphere showed a greater relative 
      abundance of Bradyrhizobium sp. (in comparison with birch and spruce) as well as 
      Haliangium sp. (in comparison with birch). In contrast, fungal community 
      structures were similar across the tailings deposit regardless of vegetation 
      density, showing a greater relative abundance of Hypocrea sp. Tailings deposit 
      fungal communities were distinct from those found in boreal forest soils. Alder 
      rhizosphere had greater relative abundances of Hypocrea sp. and Thelephora sp., 
      while birch rhizosphere were more often associated with Mollisia sp. Our results 
      indicate that, with increasing vegetation density on the mine site, the bacterial 
      communities associated with the individual deciduous or coniferous species 
      studied were increasingly similar to the bacterial communities found in the 
      adjacent forest. In order to properly assess and restore disturbed sites, it is 
      important to characterize and understand the plant-microbe associations that 
      occur since they likely improve plant fitness in these harsh environments.

AB  - The chemical composition in the precipitation is constantly changing, thus acid 
      rain type is gradually changing from sulfuric type to mixed type and then nitric 
      type. The influence of the changing acid rain type on the rhizosphere soil of 
      tree species remains unclear. A pot experiment was performed with two-year-old 
      Pinus massoniana, Cunninghamia lanceolate, Cyclobalanpsis glauca and 
      Phyllostachys edulis seedlings with similar growth condition. Simulated acid rain 
      consists of sulfuric(S/N = 5), mixed(S/N = 1) and nitric(S/N = 0.2) acid rain, 
      and each type acid rain diluted to three acid rain intensity: pH = 2.5, 3.5, 4.5. 
      Soil pH, soil organic matter, cation exchange capacity, the exchangeable Na(+), 
      K(+), Ca(2+), Mg(2+) and enzyme activity were inhibited by acid rain intensity, 
      while exchangeable Al(3+) and H(+) were promoted. Mg(2+) was most relevant index 
      to the tolerance to acid rain and the correlation degree of soil chemical index 
      was higher than that of enzyme activity. Response of soil chemical properties 
      differed in tree species under different acid rain types. Soil enzyme activity of 
      Pinus massoniana, Cunninghamia lanceolate, and Phyllostachys edulis reached 
      lowest under nitric acid rain, and that of Cyclobalanpsis glauca reached highest. 
      Rhizosphere soil of Cunninghamia lanceolate is tolerant to sulfuric and nitric 
      acid rain, and that of Cyclobalanpsis glauca is tolerant to mixed acid rain.

AB  - Rhizodegradation is a promising cleanup technology where microorganisms degrade 
      soil contaminants in the rhizosphere. A symbiotic relationship is expected to 
      occur between plant roots and soil microorganisms in contaminated soils that 
      enhances natural microbial degradation. However, little is known about how 
      different initial microbiotas influence the rhizodegradation outcome. Recent 
      studies have hinted that soil initial diversity has a determining effect on the 
      outcome of contaminant degradation. To test this, we either planted (P) or not 
      (NP) balsam poplars (Populus balsamifera) in two soils of contrasting diversity 
      (agricultural and forest) that were contaminated or not with 50 mg kg(-1) of 
      phenanthrene (PHE). The DNA from the rhizosphere of the P and the bulk soil of 
      the NP pots was extracted and the bacterial genes encoding the 16S rRNA, the PAH 
      ring-hydroxylating dioxygenase alpha subunits (PAH-RHDalpha) of Gram-positive and 
      Gram-negative bacteria, and the fungal ITS region were sequenced to characterize 
      the microbial communities. The abundances of the PAH-RHDalpha genes were quantified 
      by real-time quantitative PCR. Plant presence had a significant effect on PHE 
      degradation only in the forest soil, whereas both NP and P agricultural soils 
      degraded the same amount of PHE. Fungal communities were mainly affected by plant 
      presence, whereas bacterial communities were principally affected by the soil 
      type, and upon contamination the dominant PAH-degrading community was similarly 
      constrained by soil type. Our results highlight the crucial importance of soil 
      microbial and physicochemical characteristics in the outcome of 
      rhizoremediation.IMPORTANCE Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) are a group of 
      organic contaminants that pose a risk to ecosystems' health. Phytoremediation is 
      a promising biotechnology with the potential to restore PAH-contaminated soils. 
      However, some limitations prevent it from becoming the remediation technology of 
      reference, despite being environmentally friendlier than mainstream 
      physicochemical alternatives. Recent reports suggest that the original soil 
      microbial diversity is the key to harnessing the potential of phytoremediation. 
      Therefore, this study focused on determining the effect of two different soil 
      types in the fate of phenanthrene (a polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon) under 
      balsam poplar remediation. Poplar increased the degradation of phenanthrene in 
      forest, but not in agricultural soil. The fungi were affected by poplars, whereas 
      total bacteria and specific PAH-degrading bacteria were constrained by soil type, 
      leading to different degradation patterns between soils. These results highlight 
      the importance of performing preliminary microbiological studies of contaminated 
      soils to determine whether plant presence could improve remediation rates or not.

AB  - Nitrogen (N) fertilization is a routine practice in boreal forests but its 
      effects on fungal functional guilds in Pinus sylvestris forests are still 
      incompletely understood. Sampling is often restricted to the upper organic 
      horizons and based on DNA extracted from mixtures of soil and roots without 
      explicitly analysing different spatial niches. Fungal community structure in soil 
      and roots of an 85-y-old Pinus sylvestris forest was investigated using high 
      throughput sequencing. Fertilized plots had been treated with a single dose of N 
      fertilizer, 15 months prior to sampling. Species richness of fungi colonizing 
      roots was reduced in all horizons by N fertilization. In contrast, species 
      richness of soil fungi in the organic horizon was increased by N fertilization, 
      but unaffected in the mineral horizons. Community composition of fungi colonizing 
      roots differed from that of soil fungi, and both communities were significantly 
      influenced by soil horizon and N. The ectomycorrhizal community composition in 
      both roots and soil was significantly affected by N fertilization but no 
      significant effect was found on saprotrophic fungi. The results highlight the 
      importance of analysing the rhizosphere soil and root compartments separately 
      since the fungal communities in these two niches appear to respond differently to 
      environmental perturbations involving the addition of nitrogen.

TI  - An evaluation of selected chemical, biochemical, and biological parameters of 
      soil enriched with vermicompost.
PG  - 8117-8127

AB  - The aim of this study was to assess the changes in chemical and microbial 
      properties and enzymatic activity of soil enriched with vermicompost derived from 
      household waste. The vermicompost was tested in the rhizosphere of Larix decidua 
      seedlings cultivated in 10-L pots in: (i) nursery soil (as the control), (ii) 
      soil with 10% v/v vermicompost, and (iii) with 20% v/v vermicompost. The impact 
      of vermicompost was assessed in terms of soil C/N ratio; bacterial, fungal, and 
      nematode counts; and enzymatic activity. It was found that vermicompost increased 
      the C/N ratio from 21 to 32, as well as the content of nitrate from 78 to 134 mg 
      kg(-1), of ammonium from 14 to 139 mg kg(-1), of phosphorus from 92 to 521 mg 
      kg(-1), and of potassium from 142 to 1912 mg kg(-1), compared with the control 
      soil. The abundance of beneficial bacteria was increased (from 8.61 x 10(7) to 
      37.9 x 10(7)), along with decreases in microbiological ratios of fungi and 
      bacteria (e.g. fungi/Bacillus from 0.18818 to 0.00425). A significant 2- to 
      4-fold increase was observed compared with the control in the number of 
      beneficial nematodes belonging to bacterivorous, fungivorous, and predatory 
      groups with no change in the abundance of plant-parasitic nematodes. Addition of 
      vermicompost brought about a change in soil enzyme activity. Vermicompost reduced 
      the activity of alkaline phosphatase only. Both doses of vermicompost led to an 
      increase in the activity of acid phosphatase, inorganic pyrophosphatase, 
      dehydrogenases, beta-glucosidase, and urease. Only the higher dose had an effect on 
      increasing the activity of o-diphenol oxidase and proteases. No significant 
      change was observed for nitrate reductase. Also, the presence of antibiotics 
      produced by bacteria was detected depending on the dose of vermicompost, e.g. 
      iturin (ituC) and bacillomycin (bmyB) were found in soil with a dose of 20% v/v 
      vermicompost. Overall, vermicompost produced from household waste can be an 
      excellent organic fertilizer for larch forest nurseries.

TI  - Pinewood Nematode Alters the Endophytic and Rhizospheric Microbial Communities of 
      Pinus massoniana.
PG  - 807-817
LID - 10.1007/s00248-020-01619-1 [doi]
AB  - Pinewood nematode, Bursaphelenchus xylophilus, is one of the greatest threats to 
      pine trees and is spreading all over the world. During the nematode's 
      pathogenesis, plant microorganisms play important roles. However, many microbial 
      communities, such as that in Pinus massoniana, a major host of B. xylophilus that 
      is widely distributed in China, are not well studied, especially the fungal 
      communities. Here, the endophytic and rhizospheric bacterial and fungal 
      communities associated with healthy and B. xylophilus-infected P. massoniana were 
      analyzed. The results showed that 7639 bacterial and 3108 fungal OTUs were 
      annotated from samples of P. massoniana, the rhizosphere, and B. xylophilus. 
      There were significant diversity differences of endophytic microbes between 
      healthy and infected P. massoniana. The abundances of endophytic bacteria 
      Paenibacillus, unidentified_Burkholderiaceae, Serratia, Erwinia, and 
      Pseudoxanthomonas and fungi Penicillifer, Zygoascus, Kirschsteiniothelia, 
      Cyberlindnera, and Sporothrix in infected pines were greater than those in 
      healthy pines, suggesting an association of particular microbial abundances with 
      the pathogenesis of B. xylophilus in pines. Meanwhile, the abundances of microbes 
      of unidentified_Burkholderiaceae, Saitozyma, and Pestalotiopsis were greater and 
      Acidothermus and Trichoderma were lower in the rhizosphere under infected pines 
      than those under healthy pines and the differences might be caused by B. 
      xylophilus-induced weakening of the health of pines. Our study explored the 
      endophytic and rhizospheric microbial community changes potentially caused by B. 
      xylophilus infection of pines.

TI  - Long-term effects of mixed planting on arbuscular mycorrhizal fungal communities 
      in the roots and soils of Juglans mandshurica plantations.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Establishing mixed plantations is an effective way to improve soil 
      fertility and increase forest productivity. Arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi are 
      obligate symbiotic fungi that can promote mineral nutrient absorption and 
      regulate intraspecific and interspecific competition in plants. However, the 
      effects of mixed plantations on the community structure and abundance of AM fungi 
      are still unclear. Illumina MiSeq sequencing was used to investigate the AM 
      fungal community in the roots and soils of pure and mixed plantations (Juglans 
      mandshurica x Larix gmelinii). The objective of this study is to compare the 
      differential responses of the root and rhizosphere soil AM fungal communities of 
      Juglans mandshurica to long-term mixed plantation management. RESULTS: Glomus and 
      Paraglomus were the dominant genera in the root samples, accounting for more than 
      80% of the sequences. Compared with that in the pure plantation, the relative 
      abundance of Glomus was higher in the mixed plantation. Glomus, Diversispora and 
      Paraglomus accounted for more than 85% of the sequences in the soil samples. The 
      relative abundances of Diversispora and an unidentified genus of Glomeromycetes 
      were higher and lower in the pure plantation, respectively. The Root_P samples 
      (the roots in the pure plantation) had the highest number of unique OTUs 
      (operational taxonomic units), which belonged mainly to an unidentified genus of 
      Glomeromycetes, Paraglomus, Glomus and Acaulospora. The number of unique OTUs 
      detected in the soil was lower than that in the roots. In both the root and soil 
      samples, the forest type did not have a significant effect on AM fungal 
      diversity, but the Sobs value and the Shannon, Chao1 and Ace indices of AM fungi 
      in the roots were significantly higher than those in the soil. CONCLUSIONS: Mixed 
      forest management had little effect on the AM fungal community of Juglans 
      mandshurica roots and significantly changed the community composition of the soil 
      AM fungi, but not the diversity.

AB  - To better apply the biocontrol agent Trichoderma spp. in Northeast China, 
      collecting and screening more suitable native Trichoderma strains is necessary. 
      In the present study, 10 isolates were obtained from Juglans mandshurica 
      rhizosphere soils in Heilongjiang Province, and were identified as T. asperellum 
      (four isolates), T. harzianum (four), T. hamatum (one), T. atroviride (one). The 
      fastest-growing isolate per species on potato dextrose agar medium were further 
      evaluated in stress tolerance tests (salt, alkali, nutritional stress, and low 
      temperature) and confrontation assays (eight pathogens), which showed that T. 
      asperellum TaspHu1 possessed the best adaptation and biological control ability. 
      Then, Solanum lycopersicum (tomato) seeds were sown and treated with a series of 
      concentrations of TaspHu1 spore suspension, as was unsown soil. Tomato seedlings 
      treated by TaspHu1 had a significantly greater height, stem diameter, soluble 
      protein content and soluble sugar content. Furthermore, their nitrate reductase 
      activity and catalase activity were significantly increased, and these promoting 
      effects depended on the concentration of the spore suspension. Meanwhile, a 
      decrease in chlorophyll content was observed in the tomato seedlings treated with 
      TaspHu1. In addition, strain TaspHu1 enhanced the tomato seedlings' absorption of 
      available nitrogen, but did not influence the soil available nitrogen content. 
      Furthermore, the resistance of tomato seedlings against Alternaria alternata was 
      enhanced by TaspHu1 (smaller, fewer leaf spots), the seedlings' hormone signal 
      transduction genes JAR1, MYC2, NPR1, PR1, and GH3.2 were highly expressed. Thus, 
      TaspHu1 is a promising biocontrol candidate for use in agriculture and forestry.

TI  - Root trait-microbial relationships across tundra plant species.
PG  - 1508-1520
LID - 10.1111/nph.16982 [doi]
AB  - Fine roots, and their functional traits, influence associated rhizosphere 
      microorganisms via root exudation and root litter quality. However, little 
      information is known about their relationship with rhizosphere microbial taxa and 
      functional guilds. We investigated the relationships of 11 fine root traits of 20 
      sub-arctic tundra meadow plant species and soil microbial community composition, 
      using phospholipid fatty acids (PLFAs) and high-throughput sequencing. We 
      primarily focused on the root economics spectrum, as it provides a useful 
      framework to examine plant strategies by integrating the co-ordination of 
      belowground root traits along a resource acquisition-conservation trade-off axis. 
      We found that the chemical axis of the fine root economics spectrum was 
      positively related to fungal to bacterial ratios, but negatively to Gram-positive 
      to Gram-negative bacterial ratios. However, this spectrum was unrelated to the 
      relative abundance of functional guilds of soil fungi. Nevertheless, the relative 
      abundance of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi was positively correlated to root 
      carbon content, but negatively to the numbers of root forks per root length. Our 
      results suggest that the fine root economics spectrum is important for predicting 
      broader groups of soil microorganisms (i.e. fungi and bacteria), while individual 
      root traits may be more important for predicting soil microbial taxa and 
      functional guilds.

AB  - Elevational gradients strongly affect microbial biodiversity in bulk soil through 
      altering plant and soil properties, but the effects on rhizosphere microbial 
      patterns remain unclear, especially at large spatial scales. We therefore 
      designed an elevational gradient experiment to examine rhizosphere microbial 
      (bacteria, fungi and arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi) diversity and composition 
      using Illumina sequencing of the 16S rRNA and ITS genes for comparison to plant 
      and soil properties. Our results showed that bacterial and fungal alpha diversity 
      was significantly higher at mid-elevation, while AMF alpha diversity decreased 
      monotonically. The beta diversities of the three groups were significantly 
      affected by elevational gradients, but the effect on bacterial beta diversity was 
      larger than on fungal and AMF beta diversity. Proteobacteria, the dominant phyla 
      of bacteria, was significantly higher at the mid-elevation, while Acidobacteria 
      and Actinobacteria significantly decreased as elevation increased. The main 
      fungal taxa, Basidiomycota, significantly decreased with elevation, and 
      Ascomycota significantly increased with elevation. Glomeromycota, the dominant 
      AMF phyla, responded insignificantly to the elevational gradients. The responses 
      of bacterial and fungal alpha diversity were mostly associated with tree 
      diversity and organic carbon, whereas AMF alpha diversity mainly depended on 
      litter N and P. Changes in bacterial community composition along the elevational 
      gradient were explained primarily by litter N and P, and litter P was the main 
      driver of fungal and AMF community composition. Overall, our results suggest that 
      plant litter, particularly litter N and P, were the main source of external 
      carbon input and drove the observed differences in rhizosphere microbial 
      diversity and community composition. Our results highlight the importance of 
      litter nutrition in structuring rhizosphere microbial communities in mountain 
      ecosystems.

AB  - Drought alters carbon (C) allocation within trees, thereby impairing tree growth. 
      Recovery of root and leaf functioning and prioritized C supply to sink tissues 
      after drought may compensate for drought-induced reduction of assimilation and 
      growth. It remains unclear if C allocation to sink tissues during and following 
      drought is controlled by altered sink metabolic activities or by the availability 
      of new assimilates. Understanding such mechanisms is required to predict forests' 
      resilience to a changing climate. We investigated the impact of drought and 
      drought release on C allocation in a 100-y-old Scots pine forest. We applied 
      (13)CO(2) pulse labeling to naturally dry control and long-term irrigated trees 
      and tracked the fate of the label in above- and belowground C pools and fluxes. 
      Allocation of new assimilates belowground was ca. 53% lower under nonirrigated 
      conditions. A short rainfall event, which led to a temporary increase in the soil 
      water content (SWC) in the topsoil, strongly increased the amounts of C 
      transported belowground in the nonirrigated plots to values comparable to those 
      in the irrigated plots. This switch in allocation patterns was congruent with a 
      tipping point at around 15% SWC in the response of the respiratory activity of 
      soil microbes. These results indicate that the metabolic sink activity in the 
      rhizosphere and its modulation by soil moisture can drive C allocation within 
      adult trees and ecosystems. Even a subtle increase in soil moisture can lead to a 
      rapid recovery of belowground functions that in turn affects the direction of C 
      transport in trees.

TI  - Two-Dimensional Visualization and Quantification of Labile, Inorganic Plant 
      Nutrients and Contaminants in Soil.
LID - 10.3791/61661 [doi]
AB  - We describe a method for two-dimensional (2D) visualization and quantification of 
      the distribution of labile (i.e., reversibly adsorbed) inorganic nutrient (e.g., 
      P, Fe, Mn) and contaminant (e.g., As, Cd, Pb) solute species in the soil adjacent 
      to plant roots (the 'rhizosphere') at sub-millimeter (~100 microm) spatial 
      resolution. The method combines sink-based solute sampling by the diffusive 
      gradients in thin films (DGT) technique with spatially resolved chemical analysis 
      by laser ablation inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (LA-ICP-MS). The 
      DGT technique is based on thin hydrogels with homogeneously distributed 
      analyte-selective binding phases. The variety of available binding phases allows 
      for the preparation of different DGT gel types following simple gel fabrication 
      procedures. For DGT gel deployment in the rhizosphere, plants are grown in flat, 
      transparent growth containers (rhizotrons), which enable minimal invasive access 
      to a soil-grown root system. After a pre-growth period, DGT gels are applied to 
      selected regions of interest for in situ solute sampling in the rhizosphere. 
      Afterwards, DGT gels are retrieved and prepared for subsequent chemical analysis 
      of the bound solutes using LA-ICP-MS line-scan imaging. Application of internal 
      normalization using (13)C and external calibration using matrix-matched gel 
      standards further allows for the quantification of the 2D solute fluxes. This 
      method is unique in its capability to generate quantitative, sub-mm scale 2D 
      images of multi-element solute fluxes in soil-plant environments, exceeding the 
      achievable spatial resolution of other methods for measuring solute gradients in 
      the rhizosphere substantially. We present the application and evaluation of the 
      method for imaging multiple cationic and anionic solute species in the 
      rhizosphere of terrestrial plants and highlight the possibility of combining this 
      method with complementary solute imaging techniques.

AB  - Pogonatherum crinitum is a promising lead (Pb) hyperaccumulator; however, the 
      effects of Pb contamination on P. crinitum rhizosphere soil enzymatic activities 
      and microbial composition remain largely unexplored. Thus, an indoor experiment 
      was conducted by cultivating P. crinitum seedlings and exposing them to four Pb 
      concentrations (0, 1,000, 2000 and 3000 mg/kg Pb). Protease, urease, acid 
      phosphatase and invertase activities were determined using standard methods while 
      soil bacterial composition was determined by 16 S rDNA sequencing. The results 
      showed that rhizosphere soil acid phosphatase activity significantly increased 
      with increasing Pb concentration, while urease activity was significantly greater 
      in rhizosphere soil contaminated with 1000 and 2000 mg/kg than in the control. 
      There was a clear shift in bacterial composition during phytoremediation by P. 
      crinitum. Compared to the control, Bacteroidetes was more abundant in all 
      Pb-contaminated soils, Actinobacteria was more abundant in 1000 mg/kg Pb-treated 
      soil, and Firmicutes was more abundant in 3000 mg/kg Pb-treated soil. Positive 
      correlations were observed between dominant bacterial phyla and soil enzyme 
      activities. Metabolic pathways, such as ABC transporter, quinine reductase, and 
      ATP-binding protein were significantly increased in rhizosphere soil bacteria 
      with Pb contamination. In conclusion, Pb contamination differentially influenced 
      the activities of rhizosphere soil enzymes, specifically increasing acid 
      phosphatase and urease activities, and alters the dominance of soil bacteria 
      through up-regulation of genes related to some metabolic pathways. The strong 
      correlations between dominant bacterial phyla and enzymatic activities suggest 
      synergetic effects on the growth of P. crinitum during Pb contamination.

TI  - Both Soil Bacteria and Soil Chemical Property Affected the Micropredator 
      Myxobacterial Community: Evidence from Natural Forest Soil and Greenhouse 
      Rhizosphere Soil.
LID - 10.3390/microorganisms8091387 [doi]
LID - 1387
AB  - Myxobacteria are abundant micropredators in soil, and are social bacteria with 
      multicellular behavior and producers of versatile secondary metabolites. The 
      interaction between predator and prey populations is an important component in 
      the soil microbial food web, and this is expected to shape the composition and 
      dynamics of microbial communities. Here we hypothesize the regulation of 
      bacterial abundance and community composition on soil myxobacterial community. 
      Field investigation indicated that the relative abundance of Myxococcales in 
      subtropical and tropical forest soil from South China was 1.49-4.74% of all the 
      16S rRNA gene sequences, and myxobacterial community composition differed between 
      subtropical and tropical forest. The canonical correspondence analysis and 
      variation partitioning analysis indicated that biotic factor (bacterial community 
      composition) showed slightly stronger explanation for variation of myxobacteria 
      than soil properties (soil pH and soil organic matter). Based on the rhizosphere 
      bacterial network, the greenhouse mesocosm experiment showed that most of the 
      myxobacterial links were with Gram-negative bacteria, except that some nodes from 
      Haliangiacea and Polyangiaceae interacted with actinomycetes and 
      actinomycetes-like Gram-positive bacteria. We inferred that myxobacteria 
      preferential predation on specific bacterial taxa may explain the influence of 
      bacteria on myxobacterial community. Further study confirming the biological 
      process of myxobacterial predation in situ is necessary to advance the 
      understanding of the ecological role of predation behavior in the microbial 
      world.

      Structures and Functions of Camellia yuhsienensis Hu.
LID - 10.3390/microorganisms8091385 [doi]
LID - 1385
AB  - Camellia yuhsienensis Hu, endemic to China, is a predominant oilseed crop, due to 
      its high yield and pathogen resistance. Past studies have focused on the 
      aboveground parts of C. yuhsienensis, whereas the microbial community of the 
      rhizosphere has not been reported yet. This study is the first time to explore 
      the influence of seasonal variation on the microbial community in the rhizosphere 
      of C. yuhsienensis using high-throughput sequencing. The results showed that the 
      dominant bacteria in the rhizosphere of C. yuhsienensis were Chloroflexi, 
      Proteobacteria, Acidobacteria, Actinobacteria, and Planctomycetes, and the 
      dominant fungi were Ascomycota, Basidiomycota, and Mucoromycota. Seasonal 
      variation has significant effects on the abundance of the bacterial and fungal 
      groups in the rhizosphere. A significant increase in bacterial abundance and 
      diversity in the rhizosphere reflected the root activity of C. yuhsienensis in 
      winter. Over the entire year, there were weak correlations between microorganisms 
      and soil physiochemical properties in the rhizosphere. In this study, we found 
      that the bacterial biomarkers in the rhizosphere were chemoorganotrophic 
      Gram-negative bacteria that grow under aerobic conditions, and fungal biomarkers, 
      such as Trichoderma, Mortierella, and Lecanicillium, exhibited protection against 
      pathogens in the rhizosphere. In the rhizosphere of C. yuhsienensis, the dominant 
      functions of the bacteria included nitrogen metabolism, oxidative 
      phosphorylation, glycine, serine and threonine metabolism, glutathione 
      metabolism, and sulfur metabolism. The dominant fungal functional groups were 
      endophytes and ectomycorrhizal fungi of a symbiotroph trophic type. In 
      conclusion, seasonal variation had a remarkable influence on the microbial 
      communities and functions, which were also significantly different in the 
      rhizosphere and non-rhizosphere of C. yuhsienensis. The rhizosphere of C. 
      yuhsienensis provides suitable conditions with good air permeability that allows 
      beneficial bacteria and fungi to dominate the soil microbial community, which can 
      improve the growth and pathogen resistance of C. yuhsienensis.

AB  - Plant-associated microbiota plays an important role in plant disease resistance. 
      Bacterial wilt resistance of tomato is a function of the quantitative trait of 
      tomato plants; however, the mechanism underlying quantitative resistance is 
      unexplored. In this study, we hypothesized that rhizosphere microbiota affects 
      the resistance of tomato plants against soil-borne bacterial wilt caused by 
      Ralstonia solanacearum. This hypothesis was tested using a tomato cultivar grown 
      in a defined soil with various microbiota transplants. The bacterial 
      wilt-resistant Hawaii 7996 tomato cultivar exhibited marked suppression and 
      induction of disease severity after treatment with upland soil-derived and forest 
      soil-derived microbiotas, respectively, whereas the transplants did not affect 
      the disease severity in the susceptible tomato cultivar Moneymaker. The 
      differential resistance of Hawaii 7996 to bacterial wilt was abolished by diluted 
      or heat-killed microbiota transplantation. Microbial community analysis revealed 
      the transplant-specific distinct community structure in the tomato rhizosphere 
      and the significant enrichment of specific microbial operational taxonomic units 
      (OTUs) in the rhizosphere of the upland soil microbiota-treated Hawaii 7996. 
      These results suggest that the specific transplanted microbiota alters the 
      bacterial wilt resistance in the resistant cultivar potentially through a 
      priority effect.

TI  - Mining the Microbiome of Key Species from African Savanna Woodlands: Potential 
      for Soil Health Improvement and Plant Growth Promotion.

LID - 1291
AB  - (1) Aims: Assessing bacterial diversity and plant-growth-promoting functions in 
      the rhizosphere of the native African trees Colophospermum mopane and Combretum 
      apiculatum in three landscapes of the Limpopo National Park (Mozambique), 
      subjected to two fire regimes. (2) Methods: Bacterial communities were identified 
      through Illumina Miseq sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene amplicons, followed by 
      culture dependent methods to isolate plant growth-promoting bacteria (PGPB). 
      Plant growth-promoting traits of the cultivable bacterial fraction were further 
      analyzed. To screen for the presence of nitrogen-fixing bacteria, the promiscuous 
      tropical legume Vigna unguiculata was used as a trap host. The taxonomy of all 
      purified isolates was genetically verified by 16S rRNA gene Sanger sequencing. 
      (3) Results: Bacterial community results indicated that fire did not drive major 
      changes in bacterial abundance. However, culture-dependent methods allowed the 
      differentiation of bacterial communities between the sampled sites, which were 
      particularly enriched in Proteobacteria with a wide range of plant-beneficial 
      traits, such as plant protection, plant nutrition, and plant growth. 
      Bradyrhizobium was the most frequent symbiotic bacteria trapped in cowpea nodules 
      coexisting with other endophytic bacteria. (4) Conclusion: Although the global 
      analysis did not show significant differences between landscapes or sites with 
      different fire regimes, probably due to the fast recovery of bacterial 
      communities, the isolation of PGPB suggests that the rhizosphere bacteria are 
      driven by the plant species, soil type, and fire regime, and are potentially 
      associated with a wide range of agricultural, environmental, and industrial 
      applications. Thus, the rhizosphere of African savannah ecosystems seems to be an 
      untapped source of bacterial species and strains that should be further exploited 
      for bio-based solutions.

AB  - In this review, we present the state of art regarding rhizosphere effects on 
      eucalypt plantations. It provides a greater understanding of carbon (C) and 
      nitrogen (N) turnover in forest soils. P organic hydrolysis, soil mineral 
      solubilization, indoleacetic acid, gibberellin, resistance factors, and 
      production of siderophores by rhizosphere microbial populations help to explain 
      the tolerance of Eucalyptus plants to biotic and abiotic stresses and the 
      apparent steady-state condition of C and N soil stocks in many planted forests. 
      This work aims to present the main findings on Eucalyptus rhizosphere processes 
      and highlights their importance for trees nutrition, especially for N 
      mineralization triggered by microbial activation or microbial community structure 
      changes regarding the so-called rhizosphere priming effect and N fixation. 
      Furthermore, we present an explanatory conceptual model of the steady-state 
      condition for soil organic matter (SOM) stocks and its relation with 
      fertilization based on a nutrient balance model. This review also considers the 
      main experimental and modeling studies that demonstrate the quantitative 
      importance of rhizosphere processes to Eucalyptus genus and their shortcomings. 
      This provides a framework for process modeling under scenarios of global climate 
      change. A better understanding of rhizosphere microbiological processes may allow 
      improvements in Eucalyptus nutrition and production, as well as in accurate 
      long-term estimates of SOM stocks and C-CO(2) exchanges between forest soils and 
      the atmosphere.

      Plant Species of Crystalline and Sedimentary Areas in the Brazilian Dry Forest.

AB  - The Brazilian dry forest (Caatinga) is located in one of the world's largest 
      tropical semiarid regions, and it occurs on two large geological environments 
      named the crystalline and sedimentary basins. In order to determine the structure 
      and the main drivers of the composition of communities of arbuscular mycorrhizal 
      fungi (AMF) in the Caatinga, we collected soil samples from the rhizosphere of 
      Jatropha mollissima, J. mutabilis, and Mimosa tenuiflora, species that occur in 
      crystalline and sedimentary areas. Ninety-six AMF taxa were identified from soils 
      collected directly in the field and trap cultures. Acaulospora, Glomus, and 
      Rhizoglomus represented almost 49% of the taxon richness. The composition of the 
      AMF communities differed between the crystalline and sedimentary areas and 
      between the rhizospheres of the three plant species. Coarse sand, total sand, 
      natural clay, calcium, soil particles density, flocculation, pH, and base 
      saturation were the principal edaphic variables related to the distribution of 
      these organisms. We registered nine and 17 AMF species classified as indicators, 
      for the geological environments and plant species, respectively. Glomerospores of 
      Glomerales predominated in crystalline basins, whereas glomerospores of 
      Gigasporales prevailed in sedimentary areas; among the plant species, lower 
      number of glomerospores of Archaeosporales and Glomerales was recorded in the 
      rhizosphere of J. mollissima. The results show that the AMF community composition 
      is shaped by geological environments and plant hosts. In addition, soil 
      characteristics, mainly physical attributes, significantly influence the 
      structure of Glomeromycota communities occurring in areas of the Brazilian 
      semiarid.

AB  - To explore the influencing factors of understory plant species diversity of 
      Eucalyptus grandis, we examined understory plant species diversity and phenolic 
      allelochemicals in the rhizosphere soils of four-year-old and eight-year-old E. 
      grandis plantations with different densities (1200, 1600, 2000 ind.hm(-2)) in 
      Danling County of Sichuan Province. The results showed that a total of 45 plant 
      species were recorded, belonging to 33 families and 44 genera. With the increases 
      of stand age and decreases of stand density, plant species richness increased and 
      their importance values were evenly distributed. Phanerophytes was the dominant 
      life form across all stands. Shannon index and Margalef index of shrub in the 
      four-year-old E. grandis plantations increased significantly at the density of 
      1600 ind.hm(-2). All herbage plant diversity index except for Margalef index in 
      four-year-old ones and Pielou index in eight-year-old plantations increased 
      significantly with the decreases of density. Shannon index and Margalef index of 
      shrub in 1200 ind.hm(-2) were significantly higher in eight-year-old E. grandis 
      stands than those in four-year-old ones. Five phenolic allelochemicals in the 
      rhizosphere soils of E. grandis plantations were identified. In four-year-old 
      stands, salicylic acid concentrations decreased significantly at the density of 
      1600 ind.hm(-2). The concentrations of chrysin in four-year-old stands reduced 
      significantly with the decreases of density. The concentrations of salicylic acid 
      in eight-year-old stands increased significantly with the decreases of tree 
      density. Salicylic acid concentrations in 2000 ind.hm(-2) were significantly 
      higher in four-year-old stands than that in eight-year-old ones, but the result 
      was opposite in stands with density of 1600 ind.hm(-2). The concentrations of 
      chrysin in stand with density of 1200 ind.hm(-2) were significantly higher in 
      eight-year-old stands than that in four-year-old ones. Rundancy analysis (RDA) 
      result showed that soil pH, bulk density, and the concentrations of soil organic 
      matter, total nitrogen, total phospho-rus, and allelochemicals were the main 
      environmental factors influencing understory plant species diversity. Therefore, 
      prolonging rotation period and reducing stand density would improve 
      micro-environmental condition of forests and buffer the allelopathy of E. 
      grandis, which could facilitate the development of understory vegetation.

TI  - Granular Calcite Stimulates Natural Mycorrhization and Growth of White Spruce 
      Seedlings in Peat-Based Substrates in Forest Nursery.
LID - 10.3390/microorganisms8071088 [doi]
LID - 1088
AB  - The acidity of peat-based substrates used in forest nurseries limits seedling 
      mineral nutrition and growth as well as the activity of microorganisms. To our 
      knowledge, no study has yet evaluated the use of granular calcite as a covering 
      material to increase pH, calcium and CO(2) concentrations in the rhizosphere and 
      ectomycorrhizal development. The objective is to compare different covering 
      treatments on early colonization of the roots by ectomycorrhizal fungi, as well 
      as the growth and calcium nutrition of white spruce seedlings in the forest 
      nursery. Three treatments were used to cover the plant cavities (Silica (29 
      g/cavity; control treatment), Calcite (24 g/cavity) and calcite+ (31 g/cavity)) 
      and were distributed randomly inside each of the five complete blocks of the 
      experimental design. The results show that calcite stimulates natural 
      mycorrhization. Seedlings grown with calcite have significant gains for several 
      growth and physiological variables, and that the periphery of their root plugs 
      are more colonized by the extramatrical phase of ectomycorrhizal fungi, thus 
      improving root-plug cohesion. The authors discuss the operational scope of the 
      results in relation to the tolerance of seedlings to environmental stress and the 
      improvement of their quality, both in the nursery and in reforestation sites.

TI  - Enhanced root exudation of mature broadleaf and conifer trees in a Mediterranean 
      forest during the dry season.
PG  - 1595-1605
LID - 10.1093/treephys/tpaa092 [doi]
AB  - Root exudates are part of the rhizodeposition process, which is the major source 
      of soil organic carbon (C) released by plant roots. This flux of C is believed to 
      have profound effects on C and nutrient cycling in ecosystems. The quantity of 
      root exudates depends on the plant species, the period throughout the year, and 
      external biotic and abiotic factors. Since root exudates of mature trees are 
      difficult to collect in field conditions, very little is known about their flux, 
      especially in water-limited ecosystems, such as the seasonally hot and dry 
      Mediterranean maquis. Here, we collected exudates from DNA-identified roots in 
      the forest from the gymnosperm Cupressus sempervirens L. and the evergreen 
      angiosperm Pistacia lentiscus L. by 48-h incubations on a monthly temporal 
      resolution throughout the year. We examined relationships of the root exudate C 
      flux to abiotic parameters of the soil (water content, water potential, 
      temperature) and atmosphere (vapor pressure deficit, temperature). We also 
      studied relationships to C fluxes through the leaves as indicators of tree C 
      balance. Root exudation rates varied significantly along the year, increasing 
      from 6 mug C cm -2 root day-1 in both species in the wet season to 4- and 11-fold 
      rates in Pistacia and Cupressus, respectively, in the dry season. A stepwise 
      linear mixed-effects model showed that the three soil parameters were the most 
      influential on exudation rates. Among biotic factors, there was a significant 
      negative correlation of exudation rate with leaf assimilation in Cupressus and a 
      significant negative correlation with leaf respiration in Pistacia. Our 
      observation of enhanced exudation flux during the dry season indicates that 
      exudation dynamics in the field are less sensitive to the low tree C availability 
      in the dry season. The two key Mediterranean forest species seem to respond to 
      seasonal changes in the rhizosphere such as drying and warming, and therefore 
      invest C in the rhizosphere under seasonal drought.

TI  - Effects of nitrogen deposition and phosphorus addition on arbuscular mycorrhizal 
      fungi of Chinese fir (Cunninghamia lanceolata).
PG  - 12260

AB  - Nitrogen (N) deposition is a key factor that affects terrestrial biogeochemical 
      cycles with a growing trend, especially in the southeast region of China, where 
      shortage of available phosphorus (P) is particularly acute and P has become a 
      major factor limiting plant growth and productivity. Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi 
      (AMF) establish a mutualistic symbiosis with plants, and play an important role 
      in enhancing plant stress resistance. However, the response of AMF to the 
      combined effects of N deposition and P additions is poorly understood. Thus, in 
      this study, a field experiment was conducted in 10-year Chinese fir forests to 
      estimate the effects of simulated nitrogen (N) deposition (low-N, 30 kg ha(-1) 
      year(-1) and high-N, 60 kg ha(-1) year(-1)) and phosphorus (P) addition 
      treatments (low-P, 20 mg kg(-1) and high-P, 40 mg kg(-1)) on AMF since April 
      2017, which was reflected in AMF root colonization rates and spore density of 
      rhizosphere soil. Our results showed that N deposition significantly decreased 
      AMF root colonization rates and spore density. In N-free plots, P addition 
      significantly decreased AMF root colonization rates, but did not significantly 
      alter spore density. In low-N plots, colonization rates significantly decreased 
      under low P addition, but significantly increased under high P addition, and 
      spore density exhibited a significant decline under high P additions. In high-N 
      plots, colonization rates and spore density significantly increased under P 
      additions. Interactive effects of simulated N deposition and P addition on both 
      colonization rates and spore density were significant. Moderate N deposition or P 
      addition can weaken the symbiotic relationship between plants and AMF, 
      significantly reducing AMF colonization rates and inhibiting spore production. 
      However, a moderate addition of P greatly enhances spore yield. In the case of 
      interactive effects, the AMF colonization rates and spore density are affected by 
      the relative content of N and P in the soil.

      interactions. In this study we present the results of the long-term Intercantonal 
      Forest Observation Program in Switzerland with soil solution measurements since 
      1998 on a current total of 47 plots. The forest sites comprise two major forest 
      types of Switzerland including a wide range of ecological gradients such as 
      different nitrogen (N) deposition and soil conditions. The long-term data set of 
      20 years of soil solution measurements revealed an ongoing, but site-specific 
      soil acidification. In strongly acidified soils (soil pH below 4.2), 
      acidification indicators changed only slowly over the measured period, possibly 
      due to high buffering capacity of the aluminum buffer (pH 4.2-3.8). In contrast, 
      in less acidified sites we observed an increasing acidification rate over time, 
      reflected, for example, by the continuous decrease in the ratio of base cations 
      to aluminum (BC/Al ratio). Nowadays, the main driver of soil acidification is the 
      high rate of N deposition, causing cation losses and hampering sustainable 
      nutrient balances for tree nutrition. Mean nitrate leaching rates for the years 
      2005-2017 were 9.4 kg N ha-1 yr-1, ranging from 0.04 to 53 kg N ha-1 yr-1. Three 
      plots with high N input had a remarkable low nitrate leaching. Both N deposition 
      and nitrate leaching have decreased since 2000. However, the latter trend may be 
      partly explained due to increased drought in recent years. Nonetheless, those 
      high N depositions are still affecting the majority of the forest sites. Taken 
      together, this study gives evidence of anthropogenic soil acidification in Swiss 
      forest stands. The underlying long-term measurements of soil solution provides 
      important information on nutrient leaching losses and the impact climate change 
      effects such as droughts. Furthermore, this study improves the understanding of 
      forest management and tree mortality regarding varying nitrate leaching rates.

TI  - Structural variability and niche differentiation of the rhizosphere and

PG  - 1873-1884
LID - 10.1007/s42770-020-00337-7 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Casuarina equisetifolia is one of the most important artificially 
      planted protective forests along the coast in southern China for windbreaks, soil 
      erosion, and sand dune stabilization. Self-renewing of C. equisetifolia is very 
      limited, which might be caused by low soil nutrient levels and reduced microbial 
      activity. METHODS: Use of high-throughput sequencing of the 18S rDNA to 
      investigate the microbial communities from the rhizosphere and root endosphere of 
      C. equisetifolia in young-aged, intermediate-aged, and mature-aged forests. 
      RESULTS: Our results indicate that the diversity of rhizosphere fungal 
      microbiomes in field-grown C. equisetifolia is much lower than that of the 
      endosphere microbiomes. Bioinformatic analysis showed that rhizocompartments 
      produce the strongest differentiation of rhizosphere and endosphere communities. 
      Notably, the distribution of rhizosphere fungi communities was significantly 
      influenced by the environmental factors, not by forest ages. CONCLUSIONS: The 
      presented study suggests that the rhizocompartments and environmental factors, 
      rather than forest ages, determine the diversities of fungal community.

AB  - Minerals and rocks represent essential reservoirs of nutritive elements for the 
      long-lasting functioning of forest ecosystems developed on nutrient-poor soils. 
      While the presence of effective mineral weathering bacteria was evidenced in the 
      rhizosphere of different plants, the molecular mechanisms involved remain 
      uncharacterized. To fill this gap, we combined transcriptomic, proteomics, 
      geo-chemical and physiological analyses to decipher the potential molecular 
      mechanisms explaining the mineral weathering effectiveness of strain PML1(12) of 
      Caballeronia mineralivorans. Considering the early-stage of the interaction 
      between mineral and bacteria, we identified the genes and proteins differentially 
      expressed when: (i) the environment is depleted of certain essential nutrients 
      (i.e., Mg and Fe), (ii) a mineral is added and (iii) the carbon source (i.e., 
      glucose vs mannitol) differs. The integration of these data demonstrates that 
      strain PML1(12) is capable of (i) mobilizing iron through the production of a 
      non-ribosomal peptide synthetase-independent siderophore, (ii) inducing 
      chemotaxis and motility in response to nutrient availability and (iii) strongly 
      acidifying its environment in the presence of glucose using a suite of GMC 
      oxidoreductases to weather mineral. These results provide new insights into the 
      molecular mechanisms involved in mineral weathering and their regulation and 
      highlight the complex sequence of events triggered by bacteria to weather 
      minerals.

TI  - Rhizosphere control of soil nitrogen cycling: a key component of plant economic 
      strategies.
PG  - 1269-1282
LID - 10.1111/nph.16760 [doi]
AB  - Understanding how plant species influence soil nutrient cycling is a major theme 
      in terrestrial ecosystem ecology. However, the prevailing paradigm has mostly 
      focused on litter decomposition, while rhizosphere effects on soil organic matter 
      (SOM) decomposition have attracted little attention. Using a dual (13) C/(15) N 
      labeling approach in a 'common garden' glasshouse experiment, we investigated how 
      the economic strategies of 12 grassland plant species (graminoids, forbs and 
      legumes) drive soil nitrogen (N) cycling via rhizosphere processes, and how this 
      in turn affects plant N acquisition and growth. Acquisitive species with higher 
      photosynthesis, carbon rhizodeposition and N uptake than conservative species 
      induced a stronger acceleration of soil N cycling through rhizosphere priming of 
      SOM decomposition. This allowed them to take up larger amounts of N and allocate 
      it above ground to promote photosynthesis, thereby sustaining their faster 
      growth. The N(2) -fixation ability of legumes enhanced rhizosphere priming by 
      promoting photosynthesis and rhizodeposition. Our study demonstrates that the 
      economic strategies of plant species regulate a plant-soil carbon-nitrogen 
      feedback operating through the rhizosphere. These findings provide novel 
      mechanistic insights into how plant species with contrasting economic strategies 
      sustain their nutrition and growth through regulating the cycling of nutrients by 
      soil microbes in their rhizosphere.

TI  - Divergent biotic and abiotic filtering of root endosphere and rhizosphere soil 
      fungal communities along ecological gradients.
LID - fiaa124 [pii]
LID - 10.1093/femsec/fiaa124 [doi]
AB  - Plant roots assemble in two distinct microbial compartments: the rhizosphere 
      (microbes in soil surrounding roots) and the endosphere (microbes within roots). 
      Our knowledge of fungal community assembly in these compartments is limited, 
      especially in wetlands. We tested the hypothesis that biotic factors would have 
      direct effects on rhizosphere and endosphere assembly, while abiotic factors 
      would have direct and indirect effects. Using a field study, we examined the 
      influences of salinity, water level and biotic factors on baldcypress (Taxodium 
      distichum) fungal communities. We found that endosphere fungi, unlike rhizosphere 
      fungi, were correlated with host density and canopy cover, suggesting that hosts 
      can impose selective filters on fungi colonizing their roots. Meanwhile, local 
      abiotic conditions strongly influenced both rhizosphere and endosphere diversity 
      in opposite patterns, e.g. highest endosphere diversity (hump-shaped) and lowest 
      rhizosphere diversity (U-shaped) at intermediate salinity levels. These results 
      indicate that the assembly and structure of the root endosphere and rhizosphere 
      within a host can be shaped by different processes. Our results also highlight 
      the importance of assessing how environmental changes affect plant and 
      plant-associated fungal communities in wetland ecosystems where saltwater 
      intrusion and sea level rise are major threats to both plant and fungal 
      communities.

TI  - Influence of Resistance-Inducing Chemical Elicitors against Pine Wilt Disease on 
      the Rhizosphere Microbiome.
LID - 10.3390/microorganisms8060884 [doi]
LID - 884
AB  - Pine wilt disease (PWD) caused by Bursaphelenchus xylophilus is a major threat to 
      pine forests worldwide. Induction of resistance is a promising and safe 
      management option that should be investigated in relation to its possible 
      influence on the pine tree ecosystem, including the surrounding microbial 
      communities. In this study, two main resistance-inducing chemical elicitors, 
      methyl salicylic acid (MeSA) and acibenzolar-s-methyl (ASM), were tested for 
      their control efficiency against PWD and their influence on the rhizosphere 
      microbial composition. Foliar treatment of pine seedlings with the chemical 
      elicitors resulted in a reduction in PWD severity, with ASM showing better 
      control efficacy, reaching up to 73% compared to the untreated control. Moreover, 
      bacterial community analysis of the rhizosphere revealed significant changes in 
      several microbial taxa that were present at low relative abundance. In 
      particular, ASM treatment resulted in a significant increase in specific 
      microbial taxa, including members of the Rhodanobacter, Devosia, Bradyrhizobium, 
      Acidibacter, Mesorhizobium, and Hyphomicrobium genera, which are known to play 
      ecological and plant growth-promoting roles. Furthermore, chitinolytic bacteria 
      were shown to be reduced in response to treatment with both MeSA and ASM. 
      Altogether, the present findings demonstrate the occurrence of significant 
      alterations in several ecologically important microbial taxa after treatment with 
      resistance-inducing chemicals. As compared to MeSA treatment, ASM treatment was 
      more effective at suppressing PWD and resulted in more beneficial changes in 
      rhizosphere microbial composition.

AB  - Replanting disease caused by negative plant-soil feedback in continuous 
      monoculture of Radix pseudostellariae is a critical factor restricting the 
      development of this common and popular Chinese medicine, although wild R. 
      pseudostellariae plants were shown to grow well without occurrence of disease in 
      the same site for multiple years. Therefore, we aimed to identify the changes in 
      microbial community composition in the rhizosphere soil of wild R. 
      pseudostellariae thus providing a potential method for controlling soil-borne 
      diseases. We analyzed differences in soil physicochemical properties, changes in 
      soil microbial community structure, and root exudates of wild R. pseudostellariae 
      under different biotopes. And then, simple sequence repeats amplification was 
      used to isolate and collect significantly different formae speciales of Fusarium 
      oxysporum. Finally, we analyzed the pathogenicity testing and influence of root 
      exudates on the growth of F. oxysporum. We found that the different biotopes of 
      R. pseudostellariae had significant effects on the soil microbial diversity. The 
      soil fungal and bacterial abundances were significantly higher and the abundance 
      of F. oxysporum was significantly lower under the rhizosphere environment of wild 
      R. pseudostellariae than under consecutive monoculture. The relative abundances 
      of most genera were Penicillium, Aspergillus, Fusarium, Nitrobacter, Nitrospira, 
      Streptomyces, Actinoplanes, and Pseudomonas. Venn diagram and LEfSe analyses 
      indicated numerously specific microbiome across all the samples, and the numbers 
      of specific fungi were higher than the shared ones in the four biotopes. Eight 
      types of phenolic acids were identified across all the rhizosphere soils. Mixed 
      phenolic acids and most of the examined single phenolic acids had negative 
      effects on the growth of isolated pathogenic F. oxysporum strains and promoted 
      the growth of non-pathogenic strains. Similarly, correlation analysis suggested 
      that most of the identified phenolic acids were positively associated with 
      beneficial Pseudomonas, Nitrobacter, Nitrospira, Streptomyces, and Bacillus. This 
      study suggested that wild R. pseudostellariae was able to resist or tolerate 
      disease by increasing soil microbial diversity, and reducing the accumulation of 
      soil-borne pathogens.

AB  - The rhizospheric microbial community is one of the major environmental factors 
      affecting the distribution and fitness of plants. Ancient wild tea plants are 
      rare genetic resource distributed in Southwest China. In this study, we 
      investigated that rhizospheric bacterial communities of ancient wild tea plants 
      along the elevational gradients (2050, 2200, 2350 and 2500 m) in QianJiaZhai 
      Reserve of Ailao Mountains. According to the Illumina MiSeq sequencing of 16 S 
      rRNA gene amplicons, Proteobacteria, Acidobacteria and Actinobacteria were the 
      dominant phyla with the relative abundance 43.12%, 21.61% and 14.84%, 
      respectively. The Variibacter was the most dominant genus in rhizosphere of 
      ancient wild tea plant. Phylogenetic null modeling analysis suggested that 
      rhizospheric bacterial communities of ancient wild tea plants were more 
      phylogenetically clustered than expected by chance. The bacterial community at 
      2050 m was unique with the highest alpha diversity, tend to cluster the nearest 
      taxon and simple co-occurrence network structure. The unique bacterial community 
      was correlated to multiple soil factors, and the content soil ammonium nitrogen 
      (NH(4)(+)-N) was the key factor affecting the diversity and distribution of 
      bacterial community along the elevational gradients. This study provided the 
      necessary basic information for the protection of ancient tea trees and 
      cultivation of tea plants.

AB  - To understand the contents of various phosphorus forms, phosphorus solubilizing 
      bacte-rial community structure and the relationship between them in soils after 
      restoration from the seriously burning, we collected soil samples from artificial 
      restoration (Pinus sylvestris var. mongolica plantation, Larix gmelinii 
      plantation), artificial accelerated natural restoration (secondary forest) and 
      natural restoration (natural secondary forest) stands in Greater Khingan Mountain 
      area. Using methods of Sui et al. modified from Hedley phosphorus fractionation, 
      we measured the contents of different phosphorus forms in rhizosphere soil and 
      bulk soil (0-10, 10-20 cm). Abundances of phosphorus solubilizing bacteria were 
      quantified by high-throughput sequencing method. The results showed that the 
      contents of H(2)O-P(i), NaHCO(3)-P(i) and NaHCO(3)-P(o)in 0-10 cm bulk soil and 
      NaHCO(3)-P(o) in rhizosphere soil followed the order of L. gmelinii plantation : 
      P. sylvestris var. mongolica plantation : natural secondary forest : secondary 
      forest. The contents of H(2)O-P(i), NaHCO(3)-P(i), NaHCO(3)-P(o) in 10-20 cm bulk 
      soil and H(2)O-P(i), NaHCO(3)-P(i) in rhizosphere soil followed the order of L. 
      gmelinii plantation : P. sylvestris var. mongolica plantation : secondary forest 
      : natural secondary forest. The ratios of contents of H(2)O-P(i), NaHCO(3)-P(i) 
      and NaHCO(3)-P(o) in rhizosphere to those in bulk soil (R/S) were higher than 1 
      in all forest stands. The moderately labile NaOH-P included NaOH-P(i) and 
      NaOH-P(o). The content of NaOH-P was in order of L. gmelinii plantation : natural 
      secondary forest : secondary forest : P. sylvestris var. mongolica plantation in 
      0-10 cm layer of bulk and rhizosphere soil, and ranked as L. gmelinii plantation 
      : P. sylvestris var. mongolica plantation : secondary forest : natural secondary 
      forest in 10-20 cm layer of bulk soil. There was rhizosphere effect of NaOH-P in 
      the soil. The stable HCl-P included HCl-P(i) and HCl-P(o). The content of HCl-P 
      followed the order of L. gmelinii plantation : natural secondary forest : P. 
      sylvestris var. mongolica plantation : secondary forest in 0-10 cm layer of bulk 
      soil,and ranked as L. gmelinii plantation : P. sylvestris var. mongolica 
      plantation : natural secondary forest : secondary forest in the 10-20 cm layer. 
      The content of residual-P in the soil was not sensitive to restoration methods. 
      Bradyrhizobium, Streptomyces, Burkholderia and Bacillus were the main phosphorus 
      solubilizing bacteria across all forest stands. The abundances of phosphorus 
      solubilizing bacteria in soil of L. gmelinii plantation and P. sylvestris var. 
      mongolica plantation were significantly higher than that of secondary forest and 
      natural secondary forest. Results of redundancy analysis showed that the 
      correlation between phosphorus solubilizing bacteria and various phosphorus forms 
      was different. Our results showed that artificial afforestation was more 
      conducive in improving the availability of phosphorus in soil and the abundance 
      of phosphorus solubilizing bacteria.

AB  - Plants could maintain growth by foliar water uptake and reverse sap flow under 
      certain conditions, particularly in regions with seasonal drought. This 
      physiological activity is often overlooked, however, leaving a gap in 
      quantitatively understanding the processes and mechanisms underlying water 
      utilization of forest vegetation under drought stress. In this study, with both 
      field comparison experiments and pot experiments, we used heat ratio method with 
      stable isotope technique to monitor a typical plantation tree species, 
      Platycladus orientalis, in the Beijing mountainous area. We aimed to analyze the 
      patterns and the influencing factors of the reverse sap flow occurrence in P. 
      orientalis, to quantify the amount and the replenishment rate of reverse sap 
      flow, and to examine the characteristics and processes of reverse sap flow at 
      different parts of plants. In the field comparison experiment, reverse sap flow 
      was detected at the breast height of stem and in the root in the controlled plot 
      (drought plot) after rainfall. The reverse sap flow of root system was detected 
      later than that in the stem. By contrast, no reverse sap flow was observed in the 
      natural plot. In the pot experiments, the recharge rate of all the groups reached 
      the peak value two hours after the rainfall treatment. Except for the groups of 
      severe and moderate drought, recovery of deltaD to the original level was observed 
      eight hours after rainfall, and the reverse sap flow on plants generally lasted 
      no more than 24 h. The amount of foliar water uptake and the reverse sap flow to 
      the branches and rhizosphere soil had a negative relationship with the initial 
      soil moisture. The maximum recharge rates for leaves, branches, and rhizosphere 
      soil were (9.5+/-0.1)%, (5.9+/-0.3)% and (5.7%+/-0.6)%, respectively. Different rates 
      and timing of the reverse sap flow were observed at different parts of P. 
      orientalis. Under complex and variable conditions of water supply, it is of great 
      significance to examine the process and mechanism of reverse water movement of 
      plants to better understand its survival and competitive strategies.

AB  - A novel 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate deaminase producing bacterium, Gram- 
      stain-negative, aerobic, motile, rod-shaped strain designated YM1C-6-2(T) was 
      isolated from rhizosphere of maize grown in Northeast China. The 16S rRNA gene 
      sequence analysis indicated that strain YM1C-6-2(T) belongs to the genus 
      Mesorhizobium and is closely related to Mesorhizobium alhagi CCNWXJ12-2(T) and M. 
      camelthorni CCNWXJ40-4(T) with sequence similarities of 98.4% and 97.9%, 
      respectively. Multilocus sequence analysis of other housekeeping genes revealed 
      that the new isolates YM1C-6-2(T) forms a phylogenetically group with some 
      species in the genus Mesorhizobium. The genome size of strain YM1C-6-2(T) was 
      5.51 Mb, comprising 5378 predicted genes with a DNA G+C content of 64.5%. The 
      average nucleotide identity and digital DNA-DNA hybridization comparisons between 
      YM1C-6-2(T) and the most related type strains showed values below the accepted 
      threshold for species discrimination. The major fatty acids of strain YM1C-6-2(T) 
      were C(19:0) cyclo omega8c (47.5%), summed feature 8 (C(18:1)omega7c and/or C(18:1)omega6c) 
      (19.5%) and C(16:0) (15.1%), which differed from the closely related reference 
      strains in their relative abundance. The major polar lipids consist of 
      diphosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylglycerol, 
      phosphatidylcholine and an unidentified aminophospholipid. The predominant 
      ubiquinone was identified as Quinone 10. Phenotypic and biochemical analysis 
      results indicated that strain YM1C-6-2(T) can be distinguished from closely 
      related type strains. Based on the above results, strain YM1C-6-2(T) represents a 
      novel species of the genus Mesorhizobium, for which the name Mesorhizobium 
      rhizophilum sp. nov. is proposed with YM1C-6-2(T) (= CGMCC 1.15487(T) = DSM 
      101712(T)) as the type strain.

AB  - Increased soil nitrogen (N), warming and bark herbivory all are expected to 
      affect boreal forests in the future. We studied the effects of warming (0.5  degrees C 
      and 4.0  degrees C above ambient air and soil temperature, respectively), moderate N 
      addition (30 kg N ha(-1) y(-1)) and bark herbivory by large pine weevil (Hylobius 
      abietis L.) on soil-grown Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) seedlings in a 
      three-year (2014-2016) open-air field experiment. Seedling dry mass, root mass 
      fraction (RMF), root morphology, mycorrhizal colonization, mycorrhizal 
      morphotypes, root phenolics and microbial abundance in the rhizosphere area were 
      studied. We observed that both moderate N addition and warming showed interactive 
      effects, and generally improved seedling growth after the three consecutive 
      growing seasons. However, soil dryness was increased due to combined warming and 
      N addition treatment in 2016, and it seemed to limit the shoot growth stimulation 
      as well as increase the dependence of the non-herbivory seedlings on the 
      mycorrhizas. Moderate N addition generally reduced herbivory damage intensity and 
      increased RMF. It also decreased total mycorrhizal colonization rate and 
      increased SRL of the seedlings in 2016, but only in the absence of other factors. 
      In 2016, herbivory affected soil exploration efficiency and mycorrhizal 
      colonization without other factors, and had a tendency to increase root 
      phenolics. There were only minor effects of N addition and herbivory on soil 
      microbial abundances. We conclude that warming and N addition to soil may 
      increase growth in young Scots pine if soil drought or herbivory do not start to 
      limit it; and that in young Scots pine stands moderate bark herbivory are likely 
      to affect roots more than shoots.

AB  - Characterizing soil microbial community is important for forest ecosystem 
      management and microbial utilization. The microbial community in the soil beneath 
      Camellia oleifera, an important woody edible oil tree in China, has not been 
      reported before. Here, we used Illumina sequencing of 16S and ITS rRNA genes to 
      study the species diversity of microorganisms in C. oleifera forest land in South 
      China. The results showed that the rhizosphere soil had higher physicochemical 
      properties, enzyme activities and microbial biomass than did the non-rhizosphere 
      soil. The rhizosphere soil microorganisms had a higher carbon source utilization 
      capacity than the non-rhizosphere soil microorganisms, and attained the highest 
      utilization capacity in summer. The soil microbial community of C. oleifera was 
      characterized by rich ester and amino acid carbon sources that played major roles 
      in the principal functional components of the community. In summer, soil microbes 
      were abundant in species richness and very active in community function. 
      Rhizosphere microorganisms were more diverse than non-root systems in species 
      diversity, which was associated with soil pH, Available phosphorous (AP) and 
      Urease (URE). These results indicated that microbial resources were rich in 
      rhizosphere soil. A priority should be given to the rhizosphere microorganisms in 
      the growing season in developing and utilizing soil microorganisms in C. oleifera 
      plantation. It is possible to promote the growth of C. oleifera by changing soil 
      microbial community, including carbon source species, pH, AP, and URE. Our 
      findings provide valuable information to guide microbial isolation and culturing 
      to manage C. oleifera land.

AB  - Plant roots can exude organic compounds into the soil that are useful for plant 
      survival because they can degrade microorganisms around the roots and enhance 
      allelopathy against other plant invasions. We developed a method to collect 
      carbon (C) exudation on a small scale from tree fine roots by C-free filter 
      traps. We quantified total C through root exudation in four conifers from 
      different microbial symbiotic groups (ectomycorrhiza (ECM) and arbuscular 
      mycorrhiza (AM)) in a cool-temperate forest in Japan. We determined the 
      relationship of mass-based exudation rate from three diameter classes (<0.5, 
      0.5-1.0, and 1.0-2.5 mm) of the intact root system with root traits such as 
      morphological traits including root diameter, specific root length (SRL), 
      specific root area (SRA), root tissue density (RTD) and chemical traits including 
      root nitrogen (N) content and C/N. Across species, the mass-based root exudation 
      rate was found to correlate with diameter, SRA, RTD, N and C/N. When comparing 
      mycorrhizal types, there were significant relationships between the exudation and 
      diameter, SRL, SRA, root N and C/N in ECM species; however, these were not 
      significant in AM species. Our results show that relationships between in situ 
      root exudation and every measured trait of morphology and chemistry were strongly 
      driven by ECM roots and not by AM roots. These differences might explain the fact 
      that ECM roots in this study potentially covaried by optimizing the exudation and 
      root morphology in forest trees, while exudation in AM roots did not change with 
      changes in root morphology. In addition, the contrasting results may be 
      attributable to the effect of degree and position of ECM and AM colonization in 
      fine root system. Differences in fine root exudation relationships to root 
      morphology for the two types of mycorrhizae will help us better understand the 
      underlying mechanisms of belowground C allocation in forest ecosystems.

AB  - Plant growth-promoting rhizobacteria (PGPR) can potentially be used as an 
      alternative strategy to control plant diseases. In this study, strain ST-TJ4 
      isolated from the rhizosphere soil of a healthy poplar was found to have a strong 
      antifungal activity against 11 phytopathogenic fungi in agriculture and forestry. 
      Strain ST-TJ4 was identified as Pseudomonas sp. based on 16S rRNA-encoding gene 
      sequences. The bacterium can produce siderophores, cellulase, and protease, and 
      has genes involved in the synthesis of phenazine, 1-phenazinecarboxylic acid, 
      pyrrolnitrin, and hydrogen cyanide. Additionally, the volatile compounds released 
      by strain ST-TJ4 can inhibit the mycelial growth of plant pathogenic fungi more 
      than diffusible substances can. Based on volatile compound profiles of strain 
      ST-TJ4 obtained from headspace collection and GC-MS/MS analysis, 1-undecene was 
      identified. In summary, the results suggested that Pseudomonas sp. ST-TJ4 can be 
      used as a biocontrol agent for various plant diseases caused by phytopathogenic 
      fungi.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The data, presented here, come from samples collected during three 
      research projects which aimed to assess the impact of land-use type on Arbuscular 
      Mycorrhizal Fungi (AMF) diversity and community composition in pastures of 
      Terceira Island (Azores, Macaronesia, Portugal) and also in the native forest of 
      two Azorean Islands (Terceira and Sao Miguel; Azores, Macaronesia, Portugal). 
      Both projects contributed to improving the knowledge of AMF community structure 
      at both local and regional scales. NEW INFORMATION: Little is known on the AMF 
      communities from Azores islands and this study reports the first survey in two 
      Azorean Islands (Terceira and Sao Miguel). A total of 18,733 glomeromycotan 
      spores were classified at the species level from 244 field soil samples collected 
      in three different habitat types - native forests (dominated by Juniperus 
      brevifolia and Picconia azorica), semi-natural and intensively-managed pastures. 
      Thirty-seven distinct spore morphotypes, representing ten glomeromycotan 
      families, were detected. Species of the family Acaulosporaceae dominated the 
      samples, with 13 species (38% of the taxa), followed by Glomeraceae (6 spp.), 
      Diversisporaceae (4 spp.), Archaeosporaceae (3 spp.), Claroideoglomeraceae (3 
      spp.), Gigasporaceae (3 spp.), Ambisporaceae and Paraglomeraceae, both with the 
      same number of AMF species (2 spp.), Sacculosporaceae (1 sp.) and Entrophospora 
      (family insertae sedis). Members of the family Acaulosporaceae occurred almost 
      exclusively in the native forests especially associated with the Picconia azorica 
      rhizosphere, while members of Gigasporaceae family showed a high tendency to 
      occupy the semi-natural pastures and the native forests of Picconia azorica. 
      Members of Glomeraceae family were broadly distributed by all types of habitat 
      which confirm the high ecological plasticity of this AMF family to occupy the 
      more diverse habitats.

AB  - The study aims to determine the timing of application for high efficacy of 
      Metarhizium anisopliae as a biocontrol agent. A field experiment was undertaken 
      with M. anisopliae applied to the soil at five intervals during the peanut crop 
      lifecycle, at seed germination (day 0) through to pod filling period [75 days 
      after sowing (DAS)], and assessed the change of M. anisopliae density by sampling 
      rhizospheric soil, subsequently at regular intervals and testing counts (CFU/g 
      dry soil) through to harvest. The crop was sown into soil with an established 
      white grub population, with larval density determined at harvest when the trial 
      was concluded. Applications at 0, 15 and 30 days in the crop growth cycle, saw M. 
      anisopliae mean propagule counts drop significantly after 15 days before 
      increasing over the following 15-45 days. We observed an elevated mean increase 
      in counts 30-45 days after application at the early flowering stage (30 DAS). 
      Irrespective of application timing, in general, M. anisopliae densities declined 
      to less than the initial 10% in the late stages of peanut development. At 
      harvest, larval densities in all M. anisopliae treatments were significantly less 
      compared to the control, with the highest mortality (72%) in M. anisopliae 
      treatment applied at early flowering (30 DAS). Relationship analysis showed that 
      white grub density was significantly related to peanut yield. A regression of 
      yield on number of damaged pods also supported that treatment at the early 
      flowering caused the highest impact in terms of reducing damage to pods and 
      improving yield. These results suggest that applying M. anisopliae at the early 
      flowering stage optimizes survival of M. anisopliae in the soil profile, meaning 
      greater probability of larvae contacting the pathogen, leading to greater 
      mortality.

TI  - Rhizosphere allocation by canopy-forming species dominates soil CO(2) efflux in a 
      subarctic landscape.

AB  - In arctic ecosystems, climate change has increased plant productivity. As arctic 
      carbon (C) stocks predominantly are located belowground, the effects of greater 
      plant productivity on soil C storage will significantly determine the net 
      sink/source potential of these ecosystems, but vegetation controls on soil CO(2) 
      efflux remain poorly resolved. In order to identify the role of canopy-forming 
      species in belowground C dynamics, we conducted a girdling experiment with plots 
      distributed across 1 km(2) of treeline birch (Betula pubescens) forest and willow 
      (Salix lapponum) patches in northern Sweden and quantified the contribution of 
      canopy vegetation to soil CO(2) fluxes and belowground productivity. Girdling 
      birches reduced total soil CO(2) efflux in the peak growing season by 53%, which 
      is double the expected amount, given that trees contribute only half of the total 
      leaf area in the forest. Root and mycorrhizal mycelial production also decreased 
      substantially. At peak season, willow shrubs contributed 38% to soil CO(2) efflux 
      in their patches. Our findings indicate that C, recently fixed by trees and tall 
      shrubs, makes a substantial contribution to soil respiration. It is critically 
      important that these processes are taken into consideration in the context of a 
      greening arctic because productivity and ecosystem C sequestration are not

TI  - Seasonal shifts of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi in Cocos nucifera roots in 
      Yucatan, Mexico.

LID - 10.1007/s00572-020-00944-0 [doi]
AB  - The diversity and community structure of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) 
      associated with coconut (Cocos nucifera) roots was evaluated by next generation 
      sequencing (NGS) using partial sequences of the 18S rDNA gene and by spore 
      isolation and morphological identification from rhizosphere soil. Root samples 
      from six different Green Dwarf coconut plantations and from one organic 
      plantation surrounded by tropical dry forest along the coastal sand dunes in 
      Yucatan, Mexico, were collected during the rainy and dry seasons. In total, 14 
      root samples were sequenced with the Illumina MiSeq platform. Additionally, soil 
      samples from the dry season were collected to identify AMF glomerospores. Based 
      on a 95-97% similarity, a total of 36 virtual taxa (VT) belonging to nine genera 
      were identified including one new genus-like clade. Glomus was the most abundant 
      genus, both in number of VT and sequences. The comparison of dry and rainy season 
      samples revealed differences in the richness and composition of AMF communities 
      colonizing coconut roots. Our study shows that the main AMF genera associated 
      with coconut tree roots in all samples were Glomus, Sclerocystis, Rhizophagus, 
      Redeckera, and Diversispora. Based on glomerospore morphology, 22 morphospecies 
      were recorded among which 14 were identified to species. Sclerocystis sinuosa, 
      Sclerocystis rubiformis, Glomus microaggregatum, and Acaulospora scrobiculata 
      were dominant in field rhizosphere samples. This is the first assessment of the 
      composition of AMF communities colonizing coconut roots in rainy and dry seasons. 
      It is of importance for selection of AMF species to investigate for their 
      potential application in sustainable agriculture of coconut.

AB  - Phytoremediation has been employed as a cost-effective technique to remove the 
      cadmium (Cd) from soil and water in several ecosystems. However, little is known 
      about whether intercropping the remediating plants with rice (Oryza sativa) crop 
      could reduce Cd accumulation in rice grains. We conducted greenhouse pot and 
      concrete pond trials to explore the effects of intercropping alligator flag 
      (Thalia dealbata, Marantaceae) on soil Cd remediation, paddy soil and microbial 
      properties, and rice production. Our results suggest that intercropping with 
      alligator flag significantly decreased Cd absorption, transportation, and 
      accumulation from the soil to the rice grains (under 0.2 mg kg(-1) at a soil Cd 
      content below 2.50 mg kg(-1)). This decrease was due to the lowered Cd 
      availability and higher soil pH in the rice-alligator flag intercropping system. 
      Although planting alligator flag resulted in the reduction of soil NH(4)-N and 
      NO(3)-N, Cd content in the rhizosphere was the main factor restricting microbial 
      biomass, species, and community composition. Alligator flag could tolerate higher 
      Cd contamination, and accumulate and stabilize more Cd in its tissues than rice. 
      Our study suggests that alligator flag intercropped with rice has potential as a 
      phytostabilization plant to produce rice safely for human consumption in 
      moderately Cd-contaminated soils.

TI  - Improving models of fine root carbon stocks and fluxes in European forests.
PG  - 496-514
LID - 10.1111/1365-2745.13328 [doi]
AB  - Fine roots and above-ground litterfall play a pivotal role in carbon dynamics in 
      forests. Nonetheless, direct estimation of stocks of fine roots remains 
      methodologically challenging. Models are thus widely used to estimate these 
      stocks and help elucidate drivers of fine root growth and turnover, at a range of 
      scales.We updated a database of fine root biomass, necromass and production 
      derived from 454 plots across European forests. We then compared fine root 
      biomass and production to estimates obtained from 19 different models. Typical 
      input variables used for the models included climate, net primary production, 
      foliage and above-ground biomass, leaf area index (LAI), latitude and/or land 
      cover type. We tested whether performance could be improved by fitting new 
      multiple regression models, and explored effects of species composition and 
      sampling method on estimated fine root biomass.Average fine root biomass was 
      332 g/m(2), and necromass 379 g/m(2), for European forests where the average fine 
      root production was 250 g m(-2) year(-1). Carbon fraction in fine roots averaged 
      48.4%, and was 1.5% greater in broadleaved species than conifers.Available models 
      were poor predictors of fine root biomass and production. The best performing 
      models assumed proportionality between above- and below-ground compartments, and 
      used remotely sensed LAI or foliage biomass as key inputs. Model performance was 
      improved by use of multiple regressions, which revealed consistently greater 
      biomass and production in stands dominated by broadleaved species as well as in 
      mixed stands even after accounting for climatic differences. Synthesis. We 
      assessed the potential of existing models to estimate fine root biomass and 
      production in European forests. We show that recalibration reduces by about 40% 
      errors in estimates currently produced by the best available models, and 
      increases three-fold explained variation. Our results underline the quantitative 
      significance of fine roots (live and dead) to the global carbon cycle.

TI  - Redox Dependence of Thioarsenate Occurrence in Paddy Soils and the Rice 
      Rhizosphere.
PG  - 3940-3950
LID - 10.1021/acs.est.9b05639 [doi]
AB  - In flooded paddy soils, inorganic and methylated thioarsenates contribute 
      substantially to arsenic speciation besides the much-better-investigated 
      oxyarsenic species, and thioarsenate uptake into rice plants has recently been 
      shown. To better understand their fate when soil redox conditions change, that 
      is, from flooding to drainage to reflooding, batch incubations and unplanted 
      microcosm experiments were conducted with two paddy soils covering redox 
      potentials from E(H) -260 to +200 mV. Further, occurrence of thioarsenates in the 
      oxygenated rice rhizosphere was investigated using planted rhizobox experiments. 
      Soil flooding resulted in rapid formation of inorganic thioarsenates with a 
      dominance of trithioarsenate. Maximum thiolation of inorganic oxyarsenic species 
      was 57% at E(H) -130 mV and oxidation caused nearly complete dethiolation. Only 
      monothioarsenate formed again upon reflooding and was the major inorganic 
      thioarsenate detected in the rhizosphere. Maximum thiolation of mono- and 
      dimethylated oxyarsenates was about 70% and 100%, respectively, below E(H) 0 mV. 
      Dithiolated species dominated over monothiolated species below E(H) -100 mV. 
      Among all thioarsenates, dimethylated monothioarsenate showed the least 
      transformation upon prolonged oxidation. It also was the major thiolated arsenic 
      species in the rhizosphere with concentrations comparable to its precursor 
      dimethylated oxyarsenate, which is especially critical since dimethylated 
      monothioarsenate is highly carcinogenic.

AB  - Rhizosphere microbes in forests are key elements of the carbon sequestration of 
      terrestrial ecosystems. To date, little is known about how the diversity and 
      species interactions of the active rhizomicrobial community change during soil 
      carbon sequestration and what interactions drive these changes. In this study, we 
      used a combination of DNA and stable isotope method to explore correlations 
      between the composition of microbial communities, N transformation, and the 
      sequestration de novo of carbon in soils around Pinus tabuliformis and Quercus 
      variabilis roots in North China. Rhizosphere soils from degraded lands, primary 
      stage land (tree roots had colonized in degraded soil for 1 year), and nature 
      forest were sampled for analyses. The results showed that microbial communities 
      and newly sequestered soil organic carbon (SOC) contents changed with different 
      tree species, environments, and successive stages. The fungal unweighted and 
      weighted UniFrac distances could better show the different microbial species 
      structures and differences in successive stages. Newly sequestered SOC was 
      positively correlated with the bacterial order Rhizobiales (in P. tabuliformis 
      forests), the fungal order Russulales (in Q. variabilis forests), and delta(15)N. 
      Consequently, the bacterial order Rhizobiales acted as an important taxa for P. 
      tabuliformis root-driven carbon sequestration, and the fungal order Russulales 
      acted as an important taxa for Q. variabilis root-driven carbon sequestration. 
      The two plant species allocated root exudates to different portion of their root 
      systems, which in turn altered microbial community composition and function. The 
      delta(15)N of soil organic matter could be an important indicator to estimate 
      root-driven carbon sequestration.

TI  - Rhizobioaugmentation of Casuarina glauca with N-fixing actinobacteria Frankia 
      decreases enzymatic activities in wastewater irrigated soil: effects of Frankia 
      on C. glauca growth.
PG  - 417-428

AB  - The use of wastewater for irrigation in agroforestry is cost-effective for water 
      management. It is well established that rhizospheric microorganisms such as 
      N(2)-fixing bacteria are able to modulate rhizobioaugmention and to boost 
      phyoremediation process. To date, no study has been conducted to evaluate 
      biological effects of rhizobioaugmentation in Casuarina glauca trees induced by 
      their symbiont N-fixing actinobacteria of the genus Frankia. The objective of the 
      present study was to evaluate the main effects of rhizobioaugmentation on the 
      biological activity in the C. glauca's rhizosphere and on C. glauca growth in 
      soils irrigated with industrial wastewater. Two Frankia strains (BMG5.22 and 
      BMG5.23) were used in a single or dual inoculations of C. glauca seedlings 
      irrigated with industrial wastewater. Soil enzymes activity related to carbon, 
      phosphorus, sulfur and nitrogen cycling were measured. Results revealed that the 
      BMG5.22 Frankia strain increases significantly the size (dry weight) of C. glauca 
      shoots and roots while dual inoculation increased significantly the root length. 
      Surprisingly, beta-glucosidase (BG), cellobiohydrolase (CBH), 
      beta-N-acetylglucosaminidase (NAGase), aryl sulfatase (AS), acid phosphatase (AP), 
      alkaline phosphatase (AlP), glycine aminopeptidase (GAP), leucine aminopeptidase 
      (LAP), and peroxidase (PER) activity in the rhizosphere decreased significantly 
      in soils treated with the two strains of symbionts. This suggests no positive 
      correlations between enzymatic activity and C. glauca growth.

TI  - Bacterial community diversity in the rhizosphere of nickel hyperaccumulator plant 
      species from Borneo Island (Malaysia).

AB  - The Island of Borneo is a major biodiversity hotspot, and in the Malaysian state 
      of Sabah, ultramafic soils are extensive and home to more than 31 endemic nickel 
      hyperaccumulator plants. The aim of this study was to characterize the structure 
      and the diversity of the rhizosphere bacterial communities of several of these 
      nickel hyperaccumulator plants and factors that affect these bacterial 
      communities in Sabah. The most abundant phyla were Proteobacteria, Acidobacteria 
      and Actinobacteria. At family level, Burkholderiaceae and Xanthobacteraceae 
      (Proteobacteria phylum) were the most abundant families in the hyperaccumulator 
      rhizospheres. Redundancy analysis based on soil chemical analyses and relative 
      abundances of the major bacterial phyla showed that abiotic factors of the 
      studied sites drove the bacterial diversity. For all R. aff. bengalensis 
      rhizosphere soil samples, irrespective of studied site, the bacterial diversity 
      was similar. Moreover, the Saprospiraceae family showed a high representativeness 
      in the R. aff. bengalensis rhizosphere soils and was linked with the nickel 
      availability in soils. The ability of R. aff. bengalensis to concentrate nickel 
      in its rhizosphere appears to be the major factor driving the rhizobacterial 
      community diversity unlike for other hyperaccumulator species.

AB  - Although the use of crop-associated bacteria as biological control agents of 
      fungal diseases has gained increasing interest, the biotechnological potential of 
      forest tree-associated microbes and their natural products has scarcely been 
      investigated. The objective of this study was to identify bacteria or bacterial 
      products with antagonistic activity against Fusarium solani and Fusarium 
      kuroshium, causal agent of Fusarium dieback, by screening the rhizosphere and 
      phyllosphere of three Lauraceae species. From 195 bacterial isolates, we 
      identified 32 isolates that significantly reduced the growth of F. solani in 
      vitro, which mostly belonged to bacterial taxa Bacillus, Pseudomonas and 
      Actinobacteria. The antifungal activity of their volatile organic compounds 
      (VOCs) was also evaluated. Bacterial strain Bacillus sp. CCeRi1-002, recovered 
      from the rhizosphere of Aiouea effusa, showed the highest percentage of direct 
      inhibition (62.5 %) of F. solani and produced diffusible compounds that 
      significantly reduced its mycelial growth. HPLC-MS analyses on this strain 
      allowed to tentatively identify bioactive compounds from three lipopeptide groups 
      (iturin, surfactin and fengycin). Bacillus sp. CCeRi1-002 and another strain 
      identified as Pseudomonas sp. significantly inhibited F. solani mycelial growth 
      through the emission of VOCs. Chemical analysis of their volatile profiles 
      indicated the likely presence of 2-nonanone, 2-undecanone, disulfide dimethyl and 
      1-butanol 3-methyl-, which had been previously reported with antifungal activity. 
      In antagonism assays against F. kuroshium, Bacillus sp. CCeRi1-002 and its 
      diffusible compounds exhibited significant antifungal activity and induced hyphal 
      deformations. Our findings highlight the importance of considering bacteria 
      associated with forest species and the need to include bacterial products in the 
      search for potential antagonists of Fusarium dieback.

LID - 230
AB  - Common mycorrhizal networks (CMNs) allow the transfer of nutrients between 
      plants, influencing the growth of the neighboring plants and soil properties. 
      Cleistogene squarrosa (C. squarrosa) is one of the most common grass species in 
      the steppe ecosystem of Inner Mongolia, where nitrogen (N) is often a key 
      limiting nutrient for plant growth, but little is known about whether CMNs exist 
      between neighboring individuals of C. squarrosa or play any roles in the N 
      acquisition of the C. squarrosa population. In this study, two C. squarrosa 
      individuals, one as a donor plant and the other as a recipient plant, were 
      planted in separate compartments in a partitioned root-box. Adjacent compartments 
      were separated by 37 microm nylon mesh, in which mycorrhizal hyphae can go through 
      but not roots. The donor plant was inoculated with arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) 
      fungi, and their hyphae potentially passed through nylon mesh to colonize the 
      roots of the recipient plant, resulting in the establishment of CMNs. The 
      formation of CMNs was verified by microscopic examination and (15)N tracer 
      techniques. Moreover, different levels of N fertilization (N0 = 0, N1 = 7.06, N2 
      = 14.15, N3 = 21.19 mg/kg) were applied to evaluate the CMNs' functioning under 
      different soil nutrient conditions. Our results showed that when C. squarrosa-C. 
      squarrosa was the association, the extraradical mycelium transferred the (15)N in 
      the range of 45-55% at different N levels. Moreover, AM fungal colonization of 
      the recipient plant by the extraradical hyphae from the donor plant significantly 
      increased the plant biomass and the chlorophyll content in the recipient plant. 
      The extraradical hyphae released the highest content of glomalin-related soil 
      protein into the rhizosphere upon N2 treatment, and a significant positive 
      correlation was found between hyphal length and glomalin-related soil proteins 
      (GRSPs). GRSPs and soil organic carbon (SOC) were significantly correlated with 
      mean weight diameter (MWD) and helped in the aggregation of soil particles, 
      resulting in improved soil structure. In short, the formation of CMNs in this 
      root-box experiment supposes the existence of CMNs in the typical steppe plants, 
      and CMNs-mediated N transfer and root colonization increased the plant growth and 
      soil properties of the recipient plant.

AB  - The relationship between trees and root-associated fungal communities is complex. 
      By specific root deposits and other signal cues, different tree species are able 
      to attract divergent sets of fungal species. Plant intraspecific differences can 
      lead to variable fungal patterns in the root's proximity. Therefore, within the 
      Beech Transplant Experiment, we analyzed the impact of three different European 
      beech ecotypes on the fungal communities in roots and the surrounding rhizosphere 
      soil at two time points. Beech nuts were collected in three German sites in 2011. 
      After one year, seedlings of the different progenies were out-planted on one site 
      and eventually re-sampled in 2014 and 2017. We applied high-throughput sequencing 
      of the fungal ITS2 to determine the correlation between tree progeny, a possible 
      home-field advantage, plant development and root-associated fungal guilds under 
      field conditions. Our result showed no effect of beech progeny on either fungal 
      OTU richness or fungal community structure. However, over time the fungal OTU 
      richness in roots increased and the fungal communities changed significantly, 
      also in rhizosphere. In both plant compartments, the fungal communities displayed 
      a high temporal turnover, indicating a permanent development and functional 
      adaption of the root mycobiome of young beeches.

AB  - Petroleum hydrocarbons (PHCs) continue to be among the most common pollutants in 
      soil worldwide. Phytoremediation has become a sustainable way of dealing with PHC 
      contamination. We conducted the off-site phytoremediation of PHC-polluted soil 
      from an oil tanker truck accident, where poplars were used for the 
      phytoremediation of the oil-polluted soil in a boreal climate during a seven-year 
      treatment. The succession of bacterial communities over the entire 
      phytoremediation process was monitored using microbial ecological tools relying 
      on high-throughput 16S rRNA gene sequencing. Upon the successful depletion of 
      PHCs from soil, endophytic communities were analyzed in order to assess the 
      complete plant-associated microbiome after the ecological recovery. The 
      rhizosphere-associated soil exhibited different bacterial dynamics than unplanted 
      soil, but both soils experienced succession of bacteria over time, with diversity 
      being negatively correlated with PHC concentration. In the relatively short 
      growing season in North Europe, seasonal variations in environmental conditions 
      were identified that contributed to the dynamics of bacterial communities. 
      Overall, our study proved that phytoremediation using poplar trees can be used to 
      assist in the removal of PHCs from soils in boreal climate conditions and 
      provides new insight into the succession patterns of bacterial communities 
      associated with these plants.

TI  - Five-year nitrogen addition affects fine root exudation and its correlation with 
      root respiration in a dominant species, Quercus crispula, of a cool temperate 
      forest, Japan.
PG  - 367-376
LID - 10.1093/treephys/tpz143 [doi]
AB  - In forest ecosystems, fine root respiration directly contributes to belowground 
      carbon (C) cycling. Exudation from fine roots indirectly affects C cycling via 
      enhanced microbial decomposition of soil organic matter. Although these 
      root-derived C fluxes are essential components of belowground C cycling, how 
      nitrogen (N) addition affects these fluxes and their correlations remains 
      unclear. In this study, fine root exudation, respiration and 
      chemical/morphological traits were measured in a dominant canopy species, Quercus 
      crispula Blume, found in a cool temperate forest, the Tomakomai Experimental 
      Forest, Hokkaido University, which has undergone 5-year N addition. 
      Soil-dissolved organic carbon (DOC) was also measured in both bulk and 
      rhizosphere soils to evaluate the impact of fine root exudation on soil C 
      cycling. Compared with a control plot with no N treatment, fine roots in the N 
      addition plot exhibited larger diameters and higher N concentrations, but lower 
      specific root lengths and areas. On a root-weight basis, respiration was not 
      different between plots, but exudation was slightly higher under N addition. On a 
      root-area basis, exudation was significantly higher in the N addition plot. 
      Additionally, differences in DOC between rhizosphere and bulk soils were two 
      times higher in the N addition plot than the control plot. Although fine root 
      respiration was positively correlated with exudation in both the control and N 
      addition plots, the ratio of exudation C to respiration C decreased after 5-year 
      N addition. Nitrogen addition also affected absolute C allocation to fine root 
      exudation and changed the C allocation strategy between exudation and respiration 
      fluxes. These findings will help enhance predictions of belowground C allocation 
      and C cycling under N-rich conditions in the future.

AB  - Studies of the interactions between plants and their microbiome have been 
      conducted worldwide in the search for growth-promoting representative strains for 
      use as biological inputs for agriculture, aiming to achieve more sustainable 
      agriculture practices. With a focus on the isolation of plant growth-promoting 
      (PGP) bacteria with ability to alleviate N stress, representative strains that 
      were found at population densities greater than 104 cells g-1 and that could grow 
      in N-free semisolid media were isolated from soils under different management 
      conditions and from the roots of tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) and lulo (Solanum 
      quitoense) plants that were grown in those soils. A total of 101 bacterial 
      strains were obtained, after which they were phylogenetically categorized and 
      characterized for their basic PGP mechanisms. All strains belonged to the 
      Proteobacteria phylum in the classes Alphaproteobacteria (61% of isolates), 
      Betaproteobacteria (19% of isolates) and Gammaproteobacteria (20% of isolates), 
      with distribution encompassing nine genera, with the predominant genus being 
      Rhizobium (58.4% of isolates). Strains isolated from conventional horticulture 
      (CH) soil composed three bacterial genera, suggesting a lower diversity for the 
      diazotrophs/N scavenger bacterial community than that observed for soils under 
      organic management (ORG) or secondary forest coverture (SF). Conversely, 
      diazotrophs/N scavenger strains from tomato plants grown in CH soil comprised a 
      higher number of bacterial genera than did strains isolated from tomato plants 
      grown in ORG or SF soils. Furthermore, strains isolated from tomato were 
      phylogenetically more diverse than those from lulo. BOX-PCR fingerprinting of all 
      strains revealed a high genetic diversity for several clonal representatives 
      (four Rhizobium species and one Pseudomonas species). Considering the potential 
      PGP mechanisms, 49 strains (48.5% of the total) produced IAA (2.96-193.97 mug IAA 
      mg protein-1), 72 strains (71.3%) solubilized FePO4 (0.40-56.00 mg l-1), 44 
      strains (43.5%) solubilized AlPO4 (0.62-17.05 mg l-1), and 44 strains produced 
      siderophores (1.06-3.23). Further, 91 isolates (90.1% of total) showed at least 
      one PGP trait, and 68 isolates (67.3%) showed multiple PGP traits. Greenhouse 
      trials using the bacterial collection to inoculate tomato or lulo plants revealed 
      increases in plant biomass (roots, shoots or both plant tissues) elicited by 65 
      strains (54.5% of the bacterial collection), of which 36 were obtained from the 
      tomato rhizosphere, 15 were obtained from the lulo rhizosphere, and 14 originated 
      from samples of soil that lacked plants. In addition, 18 strains showed positive 
      inoculation effects on both Solanum species, of which 12 were classified as 
      Rhizobium spp. by partial 16S rRNA gene sequencing. Overall, the strategy adopted 
      allowed us to identify the variability in the composition of culturable 
      diazotroph/N-scavenger representatives from soils under different management 
      conditions by using two Solanum species as trap plants. The present results 
      suggest the ability of tomato and lulo plants to enrich their belowground 
      microbiomes with rhizobia representatives and the potential of selected rhizobial 
      strains to promote the growth of Solanum crops under limiting N supply.

TI  - Larix decidua and additional light affect the methane balance of forest soil and 
      the abundance of methanogenic and methanotrophic microorganisms.

AB  - Due to the activity of methane-oxidizing bacteria, forest soils are usually net 
      sinks for the greenhouse gas methane (CH4). Despite several hints that CH4 
      balances might be influenced by vegetation, there are only few investigations 
      dealing with this connection. Therefore, we studied this soil-plant-microbe 
      interaction by using mesocosm experiments with forest soil and Larix decidua, a 
      common coniferous tree species within the Alps. Gas measurements showed that the 
      presence of L. decidua significantly reduced CH4 oxidation of the forest soil by 
       approximately 10% (-0.95 micromol m-2 h-1 for soil vs -0.85 micromol m-2 h-1 for soil plus L. decidua) 
      leading to an increased net CH4 balance. Increased light intensity was used to 
      intensify the influence of the plant on the soil's CH4 balance. The increase in 
      light intensity strengthened the effect of the plant and led to a greater 
      reduction of CH4 oxidation. Besides, we examined the impact of L. decidua and 
      light on the abundance of methanogens and methanotrophs in the rhizosphere as 
      compared with bulk soil. The abundance of both methane-oxidizing bacteria and 
      methanogenic archaea was significantly increased in the rhizosphere compared with 
      bulk soil but no significant response of methanogens and methanotrophs upon light 
      exposure was established.

AB  - Mountain glaciers retreat at an increased rate under global warming, resulting in 
      exposed barren surfaces for primary succession. Soil microbes are an important 
      driver of ecosystem processes. Although variations in soil microbes after 
      deglaciation have been studied extensively, the roles of rhizosphere soil 
      microbes in the biogeochemistry cycle during primary succession are less 
      understood. In this study, Populus purdomii was present throughout the 123-year 
      chronosequence as a representative tree species. We therefore investigated 
      variations in the rhizosphere enzyme activity, microbial community structure, and 
      ecoenzymatic stoichiometry of P. purdomii along Hailuogou Glacier 
      chronosequences. The objective was to determinechanges in rhizosphere enzyme 
      activities and microbial communities, as well as the effects of nutrient 
      limitation on rhizosphere microbes. According to the results, the enzyme 
      activities and microbial group biomass in rhizosphere soil all showed a bimodal 
      trend and were highest at the 43rd or 123rd year, and enzyme activity varied with 
      succession time but not microbial community structure. The rhizosphere soil 
      bacterial community was the dominant community during the 123-year 
      chronosequence. Ecoenzymatic stoichiometry indicated nitrogen restrictions on 
      microbial activity throughout primary succession, with early succession stages 
      (5-15 years) showing greater carbon restriction than late succession stages. 
      Moreover, redundancy and correlation analyses demonstrated that soil microbial 
      phospholipid fatty acid biomass was an important factor for increases in enzyme 
      activities and that enzyme activities in turn played important roles in carbon, 
      nitrogen and phosphorus cycling in rhizosphere soil. Additionally, rhizosphere 
      soil microbial development significantly affected soil organic carbon, total 
      nitrogen and dissolved organic carbon accumulation. Overall, our study links the 
      rhizosphere microbial community and activity to successional chronosequences, 
      providing a deeper understanding of the dynamics of ecosystem succession.

TI  - Identification and inoculation of fungal strains from Cedrus deodara rhizosphere 
      involve in growth and alleviation of high nitrogen stress.

AB  - Cedrus deodara is economically and ethnobotanically an important forest tree and 
      is shown to be at decline in Northern areas of Pakistan in recent years mainly 
      due to high concentration of Nitrogen in forests. Ectomycorrhizal (ECM) 
      association forming fungi enables the forest trees to develop optimally by 
      absorbing water from the rhizosphere through their absorptive hyphae and by 
      making available the nutrients by mobilization of N and P from the organic 
      substrates. This study was conducted to identify the ECM strains from C. deodara 
      rhizosphere and to analyse the impact of high N load on the C. deodara seedlings 
      to establish N critical load value for coniferous forests of Pakistan. Six new 
      fungal strains were identified from the rhizosphere of C. deodara and were 
      registered at GenBank (NCBI) as Emmia latemarginata strain ACE1, Aspergillus 
      terreus strain ACE2, Purpureocillium lilacinum strain ACE3, Talaromyces 
      pinophilus strain ACE4, A. fumigatus strain ACE5 and T. pinophilus strain ACE6 
      with accession numbers MH145426, MH145427, MH145428, MH145429, MH145430 and 
      MH547115. Four out of six isolated strains were inoculated with seedlings of C. 
      deodara singly and in consortium (CN) in combination with nitrogen load of 0 (C), 
      25 (T1), 50 (T2), 100 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1) (T3). Agronomic, physiological and gene 
      expression studies for ExpansinA4 (EXPA4) and Cystatins (Cys) were made to 
      analyse the impact of fungal strains in relation to high N stress. This study 
      suggests a positive impact of T1 (25 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1)) Nitrogen load and a 
      negative impact of T3 (100 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1)) on growth parameters and 
      expression patterns of EXPA4 and Cys genes. Peroxidase (POX) activity decreased 
      in the order ACE5 > ACE2 > C > ACE3 > ACE1 > CN. However, the results of 
      Superoxide dismutase (SOD) showed decreasing trend in the order 
      ACE5 > C > CN > ACE1 > ACE2 > ACE3. Strain ACE3 was shown to have a positive 
      impact on the seedlings in terms of growth, physiology and expression of genes. 
      Present study suggests that newly identified fungal strains showing positive 
      impact on the growth and physiology of C. deodara could be used for the 
      propagation of this economically important plant in Pakistan after pathogenicity 
      test.

AB  - The issue of how to alleviate the negative effects imposed by water stress is an 
      interesting problem. Plant growth-promoting rhizobacteria (PGPR) colonize the 
      rhizosphere of plants and are known to promote the growth of crops. However, 
      there are few studies characterizing the physiological response of plants to 
      drought stress after PGPR inoculation. The aim of this study was to investigate 
      the effectiveness of different PGPRs in arid environments and then investigated 
      the effects of PGPR inoculation under drought stress on the physiological 
      characteristics and growth of North China red elder (Sambucus williamsii) nursery 
      container seedlings. The viable count of different PGPRs under drought stress 
      varies widely, and the drought tolerance of Acinetobacter calcoaceticus X128 was 
      significantly higher than that of other PGPRs. In comparison with 
      non-inoculation, inoculation with X128 in an arid environment significantly 
      increased stomatal conductance and mitigated the inhibition of net photosynthetic 
      rate caused by drought stress; this mitigating effect of inoculation is enhanced 
      as the level of drought stress increases. Relative to non-inoculated seedlings, 
      cytokinin levels in the leaves increased by 91.17% under severe drought stress 
      conditions in inoculated seedlings. However, X128 inoculation decreased this 
      deficit to only 44.54%. Compared with non-inoculated seedlings, the relative 
      water content of inoculated seedlings under severe drought stress increased by 
      15.06%, however the relative conductivity decreased by 12.48%. Consequently, X128 
      could increase dry matter accumulation of S. williamsii regardless of watering 
      status, indicative of the greater benefits of PGPR on shoot growth than root. 
      Therefore, inoculation of A. calcoaceticus X128 under drought conditions play a 
      significant role for alleviating the negative effects imposed by water stress and 
      promoting plant growth.

AB  - Root exudates play an important role in mediating the exchange of substrates, 
      energy and information within the rhizosphere in terrestrial ecosystems. 
      Constructing accurate and applicable sampling system of root exudates to 
      precisely collect the characters including the component and concentration of 
      root exudates and their responses to changing environments are a critical link 
      and prerequisite to understand ecological processes and information exchanges 
      across the root-soil interface. While both traditional and novel techniques for 
      collecting root exudates aim to explore the diversity and concentration of root 
      exudates, current exudate-collection methods could hardly avoid the damage of 
      root system, the adsorption and release of root exudates by soil particles, and 
      distur-bance from microbial metabolism, largely because plant roots are highly 
      associated with the surrounding substrates and environments supporting their 
      growth. Therefore, all root exudate collection methods have their own merits and 
      shortcomings. We systematically reviewed the widely-used traditional and novel 
      root exudates collection techniques and compared their advantages and 
      disadvantages. Furthermore, considering the significance and authenticity of 
      field study on the rhizosphere ecological processes in forest ecosystems, we 
      proposed three frontier research directions regarding the construction of 
      techniques for collecting root exudates in forest ecosystems according to the 
      limits of current studies, aiming to provide foundation for related studies in 
      the future.

AB  - Oil extraction is one of the causes of soil contamination with the total 
      petroleum hydrocarbons. The objective of this study was to clarify the effect of 
      Asteraceae plants on the degradation of petroleum hydrocarbon in contaminated 
      soil. Initial soils with 40 and 90 g kg(-1) of total petroleum hydrocarbon (TPH) 
      were prepared. There were three treatments: (1) no addition, (2) addition of 
      FeCl(3) and nitrilotriacetic acid (NTA) solution, and (3) addition of 
      FeCl(3) + NTA and the cultivation of nine Asteraceae plants. The concentration of 
      TPH was measured using infrared spectrophotometer, 2 and 3 months after 
      transplanting (MAT). Shoot and root dry weights were measured 3 MAT. The 
      concentration of TPH in soil cultivated with Cosmos caudatus was lower than that 
      of the initial soil (40 g kg(-1) TPH), 2 MAT. The concentrations of TPH in soils 
      cultivated with Calendula officinalis, Callistephus chinensis, C. caudatus, and 
      Tagetes sp. were also lower than that in the initial soil, 3 MAT. The 
      concentrations of TPH in soils cultivated with Achillea filipendulina, Anthemis 
      tinctoria, Tagetes erecta, Chrysanthemum coronarium, C. officinalis, C. 
      chinensis, and C. caudatus were lower than that in the initial soil (90 g kg(-1) 
      TPH), 2 MAT. The concentrations of TPH in soils cultivated with T. erecta, A. 
      tinctoria, Zinnia elegans, C. chinensis, C. caudatus, and Tagetes sp. were lower 
      than that in the initial soil, 3 MAT. A. filipendulina and C. coronarium died at 
      both 40 and 90 kg(-1) TPH soils. These results suggest that the roots of 
      Asteraceae plants degrade petroleum hydrocarbon in contaminated soil and C. 
      chinensis and Z. elegans are more suitable for using TPH remediation. Plant 
      survival and extensive root system are important factors for the remediation of 
      TPH in contaminated soil.

AB  - Anti-pathogenic protection of potatoes remains one of the most pressing problems 
      of sustainable agronomy and plant protection. For this purpose, we propose to use 
      a new type of synthetic hydrogels filled with amphiphilic recipients (dispersed 
      peat, humates) and modern plant protection products. We assumed that the 
      introduction of swollen gel structures into the rhizosphere of potatoes will 
      allow us: to optimize the water supply and productivity of potatoes; to protect 
      the fertile layer and potato tubers from the main pathogens; to fix modern plant 
      protection products in the rhizosphere, keeping them from leaching and entering 
      the environment. Preliminary laboratory experiments tested the anti-microbial 
      activity of gel structures, as well as their water retention, dispersity and 
      hydraulic conductivity with subsequent computer modeling of the water exchange 
      and root uptake in the system of "soil-gel-potato". Field trials were carried out 
      in humid (European Russia) and arid (Uzbekistan) conditions under the atmospheric 
      precipitation and irrigation on different soils and potato varieties with 
      instrumental monitoring of environment, potato growth and quality. All 
      experimental results confirmed the high efficiency of water-accumulative and 
      plant protective synthetic gel structures. Their usage sufficiently (up to 6-15 
      t/hct) increases the potato yield with 1.3-2 times water saving, complete 
      retention of agrochemicals in the rizosphere, and its actually total protection 
      against major potato pathogens, including late blight (Phytophthora infestans).

TI  - Effects of rhizoma peanut cultivars (Arachis glabrata Benth.) on the soil 
      bacterial diversity and predicted function in nitrogen fixation.

LID - 10.1002/ece3.5735 [doi]
AB  - There is a growing awareness of the importance of soil microorganisms in 
      agricultural management practices. Currently, much less is known about whether 
      different crop cultivar has an effect on the taxonomic structure and diversity, 
      and specific functions of soil bacterial communities. Here, we examined the 
      changes of the diversity and composition and enzyme-encoding nitrogenase genes in 
      a long-term field experiment with seven different rhizoma peanut cultivars in 
      southeastern USA, coupling high-throughput 16S rRNA gene sequencing and the 
      sequence-based function prediction with Tax4Fun. Of the 32 phyla detected 
      (Proteobacteria class), 13 were dominant: Acidobacteria, Alphaproteobacteria, 
      Actinobacteria, Betaproteobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Verrucomicrobia, 
      Gammaproteobacteria, Deltaproteobacteria, Gemmatimonadetes, Firmicutes, 
      Nitrospirae, Chloroflexi, and Planctomycetes (relative abundance >1%). We found 
      no evidence that the diversity and composition of bacterial communities were 
      significantly different among different cultivars, but the abundance of some 
      dominant bacterial groups that have N-fixation potentials (at broad or fine 
      taxonomic level) and predicted abundances of some enzyme-encoding nitrogenase 
      genes showed significant across-cultivar differences. The nitrogenase genes were 
      notably abundant in Florigraze and Latitude soils while remarkably lower in 
      Arbook and UF_TITO soils when compared with other cultivars, indicating different 
      nitrogen fixation potentials among different cultivars. The findings also suggest 
      that the abundance of certain bacterial taxa and the specific function bacteria 
      perform in ecosystems can have an inherent association. Our study is helpful to 
      understand how microbiological responses and feedback to different plant 
      genotypes through the variation in structure and function of their communities in 
      the rhizosphere.

AB  - The microbiological interactions of the roots of non-photosynthetic plants in 
      South America have been scarcely explored. This study analyzes culturable fungal 
      diversity associated with the mycoheterotrophic plant Arachnitis uniflora Phil. 
      (Corsiaceae) in southern Chile, growing in two different understoreys of native 
      (Nothofagus-dominated) and mixed forest (native, Cupressus sempervirens, and 
      Pinus radiata). Rhizospheric and endophytic fungi were isolated, cultured, and 
      purified to identify microorganisms associated with A. uniflora roots. We showed 
      the different fungi associated with the plant, and that these distributions are 
      influenced by the sampling site. We isolated 410 fungal strains (144 endophytic 
      and 266 from the rhizosphere). We identified 13 operative taxonomical units from 
      plants sampled in the mixed forest, while 15 were from the native forest. 
      Rhizospheric microorganisms were mainly related to Penicillium spp., whereas some 
      pathogenic and saprophytic strains were more frequent inside the roots. Our 
      results have also shown that the fungal strains are weak for phosphate 
      solubilization, but other pathways such as organic acid exudation and indole 
      acetic acid production can be considered as major mechanisms to stimulate plant 
      growth. Our results point to new fungal associates of A. uniflora plants reported 
      in Andean ecosystems, identifying new beneficial endophytic fungi associated with 
      roots of this fully mycoheterotrophic plant.

      in plant health and productivity, there is little information on microbiomes of 
      the tree species in mangrove ecosystems. Thus, in this study we aimed to 
      characterize the microbiome in soil (rhizosphere) and plant (root, stem, and leaf 
      endosphere) compartments of the widely distributed mangrove tree Rhizophora 
      stylosa. Surprisingly, bacterial operational taxonomic units (OTUs) were only 
      confidently detected in rhizosphere soil, while fungal OTUs were detected in all 
      soil and plant compartments. The major detected bacterial phyla were affiliated 
      to Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria, Planctomycetes, and Chloroflexi. Several 
      nitrogen-fixing bacterial OTUs were detected, and the presence of nitrogen-fixing 
      bacteria was confirmed by nifH gene based-PCR in all rhizosphere soil samples, 
      indicating their involvement in N acquisition in the focal mangrove ecosystem. We 
      detected taxonomically (54 families, 83 genera) and functionally diverse fungi in 
      the R. stylosa mycobiome. Ascomycota (mainly Dothideomycetes, Eurotiomycetes, 
      Sordariomycetes) were most diverse in the mycobiome, accounting for 86% of total 
      detected fungal OTUs. We found significant differences in fungal taxonomic and 
      functional community composition among the soil and plant compartments. We also 
      detected significant differences in fungal OTU richness (p < 0.002) and community 
      composition (p < 0.001) among plant compartments. The results provide the first 
      information on the microbiome of rhizosphere soil to leaf compartments of 
      mangrove trees and associated indications of ecological functions in mangrove 
      ecosystems.

AB  - As the range of bark beetles expands into new forests and woodlands, the need to 
      understand their effects on multiple trophic levels becomes increasingly 
      important. To date, much attention has been paid to the aboveground processes 
      affected by bark beetle infestation, with a focus on photoautotrophs and 
      ecosystem level processes. However, indirect effects of bark beetle on 
      belowground processes, especially the structure and function of soil microbiota 
      remains largely a black box. Our study examined the impacts of bark 
      beetle-induced tree mortality on soil microbial community structure and function 
      using high-throughput sequencing of the soil bacterial and fungal communities and 
      measurements of extracellular enzyme activities. The results suggest bark beetle 
      infestation affected edaphic conditions through increased soil water content, pH, 
      electrical conductivity, and carbon/nitrogen ratio and altered bulk and 
      rhizosphere soil microbial community structure and function. Finally, increased 
      enzymatic activity suggests heightened microbial decomposition following bark 
      beetle infestation. With this increase in enzymatic activity, nutrients trapped 
      in organic substrates may become accessible to seedlings and potentially alter 
      the trajectory of forest regeneration. Our results indicate the need for 
      incorporation of microbial processes into ecosystem level models.IMPORTANCE 
      Belowground impacts of bark beetle infestation have not been explored as 
      thoroughly as their aboveground counterparts. In order to accurately model 
      impacts of bark beetle-induced tree mortality on carbon and nutrient cycling and 
      forest regeneration, the intricacies of soil microbial communities must be 
      examined. In this study, we investigated the structure and function of soil 
      bacterial and fungal communities following bark beetle infestation. Our results 
      show bark beetle infestation to impact soil conditions, as well as soil microbial 
      community structure and function.

AB  - Chlorophyllum rhacodes, typically regarded as a rich grassland or open forest 
      "mushroom" species, was found fruiting abundantly on nests of Formica lugubris, 
      occurring in a Pinus silvestris plantation. Fruiting was absent from the rest of 
      the woodland.Research focussed on the activities in the nests that could explain 
      this. Within nests, there was a spatial relationship between C. rhacodes 
      mycelium, insect cadavers, fruitbody initiation, and roots of adjacent trees.In 
      vitro experiments found that C. rhacodes was not mycorrhizal with P. silvestris, 
      but that it had qualities which rendered it suitable for colonization of the 
      rhizosphere in the conditions of the nest mound and for further niche 
      development.Implications of the unusual presence of fruit-bodies and the 
      distribution of associated hyphae are discussed in relation to the nutritional 
      biology (and recent taxonomical reassignment) of the fungus. This includes 
      reference to the relevant physiology of insects and to the accepted evolution of 
      mutualistic symbioses between fungi and the Attini and Termitidae.An argument is 
      presented that the situation observed in vivo provides evidence of a degree of 
      facultative association and what could be tangible support for the theory for the 
      developmental origin of mutualistic fungus cultivation by insects. It is 
      presented as a context for continued experimental research.

TI  - Mangrove-diazotroph relationships at the root, tree and forest scales: 
      diazotrophic communities create high soil nitrogenase activities in Rhizophora 
      stylosa rhizospheres.
PG  - 131-144
LID - 10.1093/aob/mcz164 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: The tidal flats on which mangrove plants grow tend to have 
      low soil nitrogen contents because nitrogen-containing litter is repeatedly 
      washed offshore by ebb tides. Under such circumstances, it is unclear how 
      mangrove plants acquire the nitrogen required to support their vigorous growth. 
      In the present work, chemical and biological characteristics of diazotrophy 
      around mangrove plant roots were surveyed under natural conditions to elucidate 
      mangrove-diazotroph relationships. METHODS: Soil nitrogenase activity of a 
      representative mangrove plant, Rhizophora stylosa, which has a broad geographical 
      distribution, was measured using the acetylene reduction assay at forest, tree 
      and prop root scales. In addition, diazotrophic community composition was 
      compared between rhizosphere and bulk soil based on sequencing of nifH genes. KEY 
      RESULTS: Soil nitrogenase activity was high near prop roots, and this pattern was 
      enhanced as soil live root content increased. At the forest scale, we observed 
      high soil nitrogenase activity (acetylene-reducing activity) inside the forest 
      (the highest value was 90.9 micromol C2H2 min-1 cm-3, average 46.8 +/- 18.2 micromol C2H2 
      min-1 cm-3). Rates decreased sharply from the forest to the tidal flat (range 
      1.2-22.2 micromol C2H2 min-1 cm-3, average 7.9 +/- 4.5 micromol C2H2 min-1 cm-3). The nifH 
      operational taxonomic unit composition differed significantly among forest and 
      tree rhizospheres and the bulk soil (P < 0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: Our results 
      suggest that the accumulation of diazotrophs around R. stylosa mangrove trees 
      enhances the supply of biologically fixed nitrogen to the mangrove roots. This 
      supply is especially important when the soil naturally contains little nitrogen. 
      This nitrogen acquisition system may be a key process that explains the high 
      productivity of mangrove ecosystems.

      photosynthetic characteristics of Sambucus williamsii Hance container seedlings 
      under drought stress.

AB  - Plant growth-promoting rhizobacteria (PGPR) are beneficial bacteria that survive 
      within the range of plant rhizosphere and can promote plant growth. The effects 
      of PGPR in promoting plant growth, activating soil nutrients, reducing fertilizer 
      application, and improving the resistance of plant inducible system have been 
      widely investigated. However, few studies have investigated PGPR as elicitors of 
      tolerance to abiotic stresses, especially drought stress. In this study, the 
      effects of Acinetobacter calcoaceticus X128 on the photosynthetic rate (P(n)), 
      stomatal conductance (G(s)), intracellular CO(2) concentration (C(i)), and total 
      chlorophyll content [Chl(a+b)] of Sambucus williamsii Hance seedling leaves under 
      moderate drought stress and drought-rewatering conditions were determined. 
      Compared with those of uninoculated seedlings, the average P(n) values during the 
      entire drought stress of inoculated seedlings increased by 12.99%. As the drought 
      duration was lengthened, C(i) of uninoculated leaves continued to increase after 
      rapidly declining, whereas G(s) continuously decreased. Furthermore, their 
      photosynthetic properties were simultaneously restricted by stomatal and 
      non-stomatal factors. After X128 inoculation, C(i) and G(s) of S. williamsii 
      Hance leaves continued to decrease, and their photosynthetic properties were 
      mainly restricted by stomatal factors. At the end of the drought stress, water 
      stress reduced [Chl(a + b)] of S. williamsii Hance leaves by 13.49%. However, 
      X128 inoculation decreased this deficit to only 7.39%. After water supply was 
      recovered, P(n), G(s), and [Chl(a+b)] in uninoculated leaves were reduced by 
      14.23%, 12.02%, and 5.86%, respectively, relative to those under well-watered 
      conditions. However, C(i) increased by 6.48%. Compared with those of uninoculated 
      seedlings, P(n), G(s), and [Chl(a+b)] in X128-inoculated seedlings were increased 
      by 9.83%, 9.30%, and 6.85%, respectively. Therefore, the inoculation of X128 
      under arid environments can mitigate the reduction of chlorophyll, delay the 
      restriction caused by non-stomatal factors to P(n) in plant leaves under water 
      stress, and can be more conducive to the recovery of photosynthetic functions of 
      leaves after water supply is recovered.

AB  - A Gram-stain-positive bacterium, designated strain ASL46(T), was isolated from 
      litter layer of a pine forest located in Anmyondo, Korea. Strain ASL46(T) was 
      found to be an aerobic, motile, endospore-forming rod which can grow at 20-45  degrees C 
      (optimum, 37  degrees C), at pH 6.0-11.0 (optimum, pH 7.0) and at salinities of 0-2% 
      (w/v) NaCl (optimum, 1% NaCl). Phylogenetic analyses based on 16S rRNA gene 
      sequences revealed that strain ASL46(T) belongs to the genus Paenibacillus, 
      showing highest sequence similarity to P. yonginensis DCY84(T) (98.3%), P. 
      physcomitrella XB(T) (97.4%) and P. faecis CIP 101062(T) (96.6%). The average 
      nucleotide identity (ANI) and DNA-DNA relatedness between the strain ASL46(T) and 
      P. physcomitrella XB(T) and P. yonginensis DCY84(T) yielded ANI values of 84.6 
      and 84.5% and DNA-DNA relatedness of 11.7 +/- 0.7 and 10.9 +/- 0.2%, respectively. 
      The DNA G+C content of the genomic DNA of strain ASL46(T) was 52.1 mol%. The 
      predominant isoprenoid quinone was identified as menaquinone-7 and the major 
      cellular fatty acids were determined to be anteiso-C(15:0), C(16:0) and 
      iso-C(16:0). The major polar lipids were diphosphatidylglycerol, 
      phosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylethanolamine, five unidentified 
      aminophospholipids, an unidentified phospholipid and an unidentified glycolipid. 
      The whole-cell sugar was found to be ribose and cell wall peptidoglycan contained 
      meso-diaminopimelic acid. On the basis of phylogenetic analyses, and phenotypic 
      and chemotaxonomic characteristics, strain ASL46(T) represents a novel species of 
      the genus Paenibacillus, for which the name Paenibacillus pinistramenti sp. nov. 
      is proposed. The type strain is ASL46(T) (= KACC 18701(T) = NBRC 111876(T)).

AB  - The seasonal dynamics of microbial diversity within the rhizosphere of Ulmus 
      pumila L. var. sabulosa in the hinterland of the Otindag Sandy Land of China were 
      investigated using high-throughput sequencing of bacterial 16S rRNA genes and 
      fungal ITS region sequences. A significant level of bacterial and fungal 
      diversity was observed overall, with detection of 7,676 bacterial Operational 
      Taxonomic Units (OTUs) belonging to 40 bacteria phyla and 3,582 fungal OTUs 
      belonging to six phyla. Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria, and Firmicutes were the 
      dominant bacterial phyla among communities, while Ascomycota, Basidiomycota, and 
      Zygomycota were the dominant phyla of fungal communities. Seasonal changes 
      influenced the alpha-diversity and beta-diversity of bacterial communities within elm 
      rhizospheres more than for fungal communities. Inferred functional analysis of 
      the bacterial communities identified evidence for 41 level two KEGG (Kyoto 
      Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes) orthology groups, while guild-based analysis 
      of the fungal communities identified eight ecological guilds. Metabolism was the 
      most prevalent bacterial functional group, while saprotrophs prevailed among the 
      identified fungal ecological guilds. Soil moisture and soil nutrient content were 
      important factors that affected the microbial community structures of elm 
      rhizospheres across seasons. The present pilot study provides an important 
      baseline investigation of elm rhizosphere microbial communities.

TI  - Organs, Cultivars, Soil, and Fruit Properties Affect Structure of Endophytic 
      Mycobiota of Pinggu Peach Trees.
LID - 10.3390/microorganisms7090322 [doi]
LID - 322
AB  - Pinggu peach (Prunus persica (L.)) has great economic and ecological value in 
      north China. As a plant, the peach is naturally colonized by a variety of 
      endophytic fungi, which are very important for tree growth and health. However, 
      the mycobiota composition and their affecting factors of the peach trees are 
      still unknown. In our study, the fungal communities in flowers, leaves, stems, 
      and roots of the three cultivars (Dajiubao, Qingfeng, and Jingyan) of Pinggu 
      peach trees and in the rhizosphere soils were investigated by both Illumina Miseq 
      sequencing of ITS rDNA and traditional culturing methods. For organs, except for 
      roots, flowers had the highest fungal richness and diversity, while the leaves 
      had the lowest richness and diversity. Ascomycota and Basidiomycota were the most 
      abundant phyla among samples. The fungal assemblage composition of each organ was 
      distinctive. Fungal communities of the three cultivars also differed from each 
      other. The fungal community structure significantly correlated with soil pH, soil 
      K, fruit soluble solid content, and fruit titratable acidity with the redundancy 
      analysis (RDA). Most isolated fungal strains can be found within high-throughput 
      sequencing identified taxa. This study indicates that plant organs, the 
      cultivars, the soil, and fruit properties may have profound effects on the 
      endophytic fungal community structure associated with Pinggu peach trees. With 
      this study, microbiota-mediated pathogen protection and fruit quality promotion 
      associated with peach trees could be further studied.

AB  - Plant phenotype is affected by a community of associated microorganisms which 
      requires dissection of the functional fraction. In this study, we aimed to 
      culture the functionally active fraction of an upland soil microbiome, which can 
      suppress tomato bacterial wilt. The microbiome fraction (MF) from the rhizosphere 
      of Hawaii 7996 treated with an upland soil or forest soil MF was successively 
      cultured in a designed modified M9 (MM9) medium partially mimicking the nutrient 
      composition of tomato root exudates. Bacterial cells were harvested to amplify V3 
      and V4 regions of 16S rRNA gene for QIIME based sequence analysis and were also 
      treated to Hawaii 7996 prior to Ralstonia solanacearum inoculation. The disease 
      progress indicated that the upland MM9 1(st) transfer suppressed the bacterial 
      wilt. Community analysis revealed that species richness was declined by 
      successive cultivation of the MF. The upland MM9 1(st) transfer harbored 
      population of phylum Proteobacteria (98.12%), Bacteriodetes (0.69%), Firmicutes 
      (0.51%), Actinobacteria (0.08%), unidentified (0.54%), Cyanobacteria (0.01%), FBP 
      (0.001%), OD1 (0.001%), Acidobacteria (0.005%). The family Enterobacteriaceae of 
      Proteobacteria was the dominant member (86.76%) of the total population of which 
      genus Enterobacter composed 86.76% making it a potential candidate to suppress 
      bacterial wilt. The results suggest that this mixed culture approach is feasible 
      to harvest microorganisms which may function as biocontrol agents.

      distinct microbial structures from healthy plant rhizosphere soil (HR). The 
      enriched taxon of Bordetella and key taxon of Chaetomium together with some other 
      taxa showed negative associations with pathogen in HR, indicating their 
      importance in pathogen inhibition. Furthermore, a more stable microbiota was 
      observed in HR than in WR. Taken together, the lower pathogen abundance, specific 
      beneficial microbial taxa and stable microbiota contributed to disease 
      suppression.

AB  - Radiocesium contamination of forests has been a severe problem after the 
      Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant accident in 2011. Bed logs of Konara oak 
      (Quercus serrata Murray), used for mushroom cultivation, were an economically 
      important product from the forests prior to their contamination. One of the 
      potential countermeasures to reduce radiocesium content in trees is potassium 
      fertilization, but the evidence for the effect of K(+) in reducing Cs(+) uptake 
      has not been obtained yet in the woody plant. Therefore, we investigated the 
      ability of rhizospheric K(+) to suppress uptake and translocation of Cs(+) in 
      Konara oak seedlings through hydroponic experiments in order to clarify the 
      effect of K(+). Elemental analysis showed that the seedlings cultivated for 4 
      weeks under low-K (K(+) = 50 muM) contained higher amount of Cs comparing to the 
      seedlings cultivated under high-K (K(+) = 3 mM). Then, the uptake rate of Cs(+) 
      and K(+) in the seedlings from the solution having 50 muM K(+) and 0.1 muM Cs(+) 
      was calculated using radioactive (137)Cs(+) and (42)K(+) to evaluate the effect 
      of growth condition on the ion uptake mechanism. The interference between Cs(+) 
      and K(+) at the site of root uptake was also evaluated based on the Cs(+) and 
      K(+) uptake rates at K(+) concentrations of 50 muM, 200 muM, and 3 mM in the 
      seedlings grown under the medium-K (K(+) = 200 muM) condition. As a result, the 
      Cs(+) uptake rate at 50 muM K(+) was not influenced by the growth condition, 
      whereas Cs(+) uptake decreased when the uptake solution itself was supplemented 
      with 3 mM K(+). In addition, the Cs/K ratio in the seedlings was found to rise to 
      exceed the Cs/K ratio in the culture solution as the rhizospheric K(+) 
      concentration increased, which was in contrast with previous findings in 
      herbaceous plants. Our experiments demonstrated the first direct evidence for 
      woody plants that a high K(+) concentration can suppress Cs accumulation in 
      Konara oak and that it was derived from competition for uptake between K(+) and 
      Cs(+) in the rhizosphere, not from the growth K(+) condition.

TI  - Nestedness in Arbuscular Mycorrhizal Fungal Communities in a Volcanic Ecosystem: 
      Selection of Disturbance-tolerant Fungi along an Elevation Gradient.
PG  - 327-333
LID - 10.1264/jsme2.ME19073 [doi]
AB  - Arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi play a significant role in the establishment 
      and resilience of vegetation in harsh environments, such as volcanic slopes, in 
      which soil is frequently disturbed by ash falling and erosion. We characterized 
      AM fungal communities associated with a pioneer grass in a volcanic slope based 
      on the disturbance tolerance of the fungi, addressing the hypothesis that soil 
      disturbance is a major ecological filter for AM fungi in volcanic ecosystems and, 
      thus, fungi that are more tolerant to soil disturbance are selected at higher 
      elevations (i.e. nearer to the crater). Paired soil-core samples were collected 
      from the rhizosphere of Miscanthus sinensis between the vegetation limit and 
      forest limit on a volcanic slope and used in a trap culture with M. sinensis 
      seedlings, in which one of the paired samples was sieved to destroy hyphal 
      networks (disturbance treatment), while the other was not (intact treatment). 
      Seedlings were grown in a greenhouse for two months, and the roots were subjected 
      to molecular analysis of fungal communities. AM fungal diversity decreased with 
      increasing elevations, in which nested structure was observed. Community 
      dissimilarity between the disturbed and intact communities decreased with 
      increasing elevations, suggesting that communities at higher elevations were more 
      robust against soil disturbance. These results suggest that AM fungi that are 
      more tolerant to soil disturbance are more widely distributed across the 
      ecosystem, that is, they are generalists. The wide distribution of 
      disturbance-tolerant fungi may have significant implications for the rapid 
      resilience of vegetation after disturbance in the ecosystem.

TI  - Screening of the High-Rhizosphere Competent Limoniastrum monopetalum' Culturable 
      Endophyte Microbiota Allows the Recovery of Multifaceted and Versatile Biocontrol 
      Agents.
LID - 10.3390/microorganisms7080249 [doi]
LID - 249
AB  - Halophyte Limoniastrum monopetalum, an evergreen shrub inhabiting the 
      Mediterranean region, has well-documented phytoremediation potential for metal 
      removal from polluted sites. It is also considered to be a medicinal halophyte 
      with potent activity against plant pathogens. Therefore, L. monopetalum may be a 
      suitable candidate for isolating endophytic microbiota members that provide plant 
      growth promotion (PGP) and resistance to abiotic stresses. Selected for 
      biocontrol abilities, these endophytes may represent multifaceted and versatile 
      biocontrol agents, combining pathogen biocontrol in addition to PGP and plant 
      protection against abiotic stresses. In this study 117 root culturable bacterial 
      endophytes, including Gram-positive (Bacillus and Brevibacillus), Gram-negative 
      (Proteus, Providencia, Serratia, Pantoea, Klebsiella, Enterobacter and 
      Pectobacterium) and actinomycete Nocardiopsis genera have been recovered from L. 
      monopetalum. The collection exhibited high levels of biocontrol abilities against 
      bacterial (Agrobacterium tumefaciens MAT2 and Pectobacterium carotovorum MAT3) 
      and fungal (Alternaria alternata XSZJY-1, Rhizoctonia bataticola MAT1 and 
      Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. radicis lycopersici FORL) pathogens. Several bacteria 
      also showed PGP capacity and resistance to antibiotics and metals. A highly 
      promising candidate Bacillus licheniformis LMRE 36 with high PGP, biocontrol, 
      metal and antibiotic, resistance was subsequently tested in planta (potato and 
      olive trees) for biocontrol of a collection of 14 highly damaging Fusarium 
      species. LMRE 36 proved very effective against the collection in both species and 
      against an emerging Fusarium sp. threatening olive trees culture in nurseries. 
      These findings provide a demonstration of our pyramiding strategy. Our strategy 
      was effective in combining desirable traits in biocontrol agents towards 
      broad-spectrum resistance against pathogens and protection of crops from abiotic 
      stresses. Stacking multiple desirable traits into a single biocontrol agent is 
      achieved by first, careful selection of a host for endophytic microbiota 
      recovery; second, stringent in vitro selection of candidates from the collection; 
      and third, application of the selected biocontrol agents in planta experiments. 
      That pyramiding strategy could be successfully used to mitigate effects of 
      diverse biotic and abiotic stresses on plant growth and productivity. It is 
      anticipated that the strategy will provide a new generation of biocontrol agents 
      by targeting the microbiota of plants in hostile environments.

AB  - Pollution affects most of the urban and forest environments at different levels 
      causing well-known effects on human and plant health. The influence that 
      pollutants exert on plant-associated microbiota might direct plant health and, in 
      some cases, also the removal of pollutants by plants. With the advent of 
      nanotechnologies, an increasing amount of engineered nanoparticles are being 
      introduced into the environment, and consequently, their impact on 
      plant-associated microorganisms needs to be investigated. In this context, silver 
      nanoparticles (Ag-NPs) were experimentally supplied at leaf and root level of 
      poplar plants to assess Ag-NPs effects on plant microbiota. Leaf Ag-NP treatment 
      increased bacteria and fungi evenness and determined a significant reduction in 
      both microbial groups, while root Ag-NP treatment reduced the bacterial and 
      fungal biodiversity. Bioinformatics functional analysis showed that Ag-NP 
      treatment reduced the aerobic and stimulated facultative anaerobic and oxidative 
      stress-tolerant bacteria. Our study offers new insights into the effects of 
      Ag-NPs on both phyllosphere and rhizosphere poplar-associated microbiota and may 
      represent a first attempt to understand the behavior of microbial communities of 
      a tree species growing in a polluted environment.

AB  - Despite the social concern about the generalization of antibiotic resistance 
      hotspots worldwide, very little is known about the contribution of different 
      potential sources to the global risk. Here we present a quantitative analysis of 
      the distribution of Antibiotic Resistance Genes (ARGs) in soil, rhizospheric 
      soil, roots, leaves and beans in tomato, lettuce and broad beans crops (165 
      samples in total), grown in nine commercial plots distributed in four 
      geographical zones in the vicinity of Barcelona (North East Spain). We also 
      analyzed five soil samples from a nearby forest, with no record of agricultural 
      activities. DNA samples were analyzed for their content in the ARGs sul1, tetM, 
      qnrS1, bla(CTX-M-32), bla(OXA-58), mecA, and bla(TEM), plus the integron intI1, 
      using qPCR methods. In addition, soil microbiomes from the different plots were 
      analyzed by amplicon-targeted 16S rRNA gene sequencing. Our data show a 
      decreasing gradient of ARG loads from soil to fruits and beans, the latter 
      showing only from 0.1 to 0.01% of the abundance values in soil. The type of crop 
      was the main determinant for both ARG distribution and microbiome composition 
      among the different plots, with minor contributions of geographic location and 
      irrigation water source. We propose that soil amendment and/or fertilization, 
      more than irrigation water, are the main drivers of ARG loads on the edible parts 
      of the crop, and that they should therefore be specifically controlled.

TI  - Viruses of fungi and oomycetes in the soil environment.
LID - fiz119 [pii]
LID - 10.1093/femsec/fiz119 [doi]
AB  - Soils support a myriad of organisms hosting highly diverse viromes. In this 
      minireview, we focus on viruses hosted by true fungi and oomycetes (members of 
      Stamenopila, Chromalveolata) inhabiting bulk soil, rhizosphere and litter layer, 
      and representing different ecological guilds, including fungal saprotrophs, 
      mycorrhizal fungi, mutualistic endophytes and pathogens. Viruses infecting fungi 
      and oomycetes are characterized by persistent intracellular nonlytic lifestyles 
      and transmission via spores and/or hyphal contacts. Almost all fungal and 
      oomycete viruses have genomes composed of single-stranded or double-stranded RNA, 
      and recent studies have revealed numerous novel viruses representing yet 
      unclassified family-level groups. Depending on the virus-host combination, 
      infections can be asymptomatic, beneficial or detrimental to the host. Thus, 
      mycovirus infections may contribute to the multiplex interactions of hosts, 
      therefore likely affecting the dynamics of fungal communities required for the 
      functioning of soil ecosystems. However, the effects of fungal and oomycete 
      viruses on soil ecological processes are still mostly unknown. Interestingly, new 
      metagenomics data suggest an extensive level of horizontal virus transfer between 
      plants, fungi and insects.

TI  - Tolerance and remedial potential of trees submitted to atrazine and sulfentrazone 
      in the rhizosphere.
PG  - 78-86
LID - 10.1080/15226514.2019.1644290 [doi]
AB  - Residual herbicides are important for agricultural production but they may be 
      lost underground. Trees capable of removing or degrading these products are 
      interesting to the agro system. The objective was to evaluate the tolerance and 
      remedial potential of trees in soil contaminated by atrazine and sulfentrazone. 
      The experiment was arranged in a 7 x 3 factorial scheme. Factor one was composed 
      of Inga edulis Mart., Myrsine gardneriana A.DC., Schizolobium parahyba (Vell.) 
      Blake, Toona ciliata M. Roem., Trichilia hirta L. and Triplaris americana L. 
      Factor two consisted of monthly solutions of atrazine (1000 g ha(-1)), 
      sulfentrazone (150 g ha(-1)) and water only (control), applied through subgrade 
      irrigation. The following parameters were evaluated: visual intoxication, plant 
      growth, and biomass accumulation. Cucumber biomass was used as an indicator of 
      herbicide residues in soil. Symptoms of intoxication were found only in S. 
      parahyba and T. americana. Growth and biomass of the species were not affected by 
      herbicides, except for T. americana. The herbicides provided higher biomass for 
      T. hirta. Saplings of I. edulis, M. gardneriana, S. parahyba, T. ciliate, and T. 
      hirta tolerate atrazine and sulfentrazone. Triplaris americana is sensitive to 
      sulfentrazone. Inga edulis decreased sulfentrazone residues in the soil.

TI  - Ecological Processes Shaping Bulk Soil and Rhizosphere Microbiome Assembly in a 
      Long-Term Amazon Forest-to-Agriculture Conversion.
PG  - 110-122
LID - 10.1007/s00248-019-01401-y [doi]
AB  - Forest-to-agriculture conversion has been identified as a major threat to soil 
      biodiversity and soil processes resilience, although the consequences of 
      long-term land use change to microbial community assembly and ecological 
      processes have been often neglected. Here, we combined metagenomic approach with 
      a large environmental dataset, to (i) identify the microbial assembly patterns 
      and, (ii) to evaluate the ecological processes governing microbial assembly, in 
      bulk soil and soybean rhizosphere, along a long-term forest-to-agriculture 
      conversion chronosequence, in Eastern Amazon. We hypothesized that (i) microbial 
      communities in bulk soil and rhizosphere have different assembly patterns and 
      (ii) the weight of the four ecological processes governing assembly differs 
      between bulk soil and rhizosphere and along the chronosequence in the same 
      fraction. Community assembly in bulk soil fitted most the zero-sum multinomial 
      (ZSM) neutral-based model, regardless of time. Low to intermediate dispersal was 
      observed. Decreasing influence of abiotic factors was counterbalanced by 
      increasing influence of biotic factors, as the chronosequence advanced. 
      Undominated ecological processes of dispersal limitation and variable selection 
      governing community assembly were observed in this soil fraction. For soybean 
      rhizosphere, community assembly fitted most the lognormal niche-based model in 
      all chronosequence areas. High dispersal and an increasing influence of abiotic 
      factors coupled with a decreasing influence of biotic factors were found along 
      the chronosequence. Thus, we found a dominant role of dispersal process governing 
      microbial assembly with a secondary effect of homogeneous selection process, 
      mainly driven by decreasing aluminum and increased cations saturation in soil 
      solution, due to long-term no-till cropping. Together, our results indicate that 
      long-term no-till lead community abundances in bulk soil to be in a transient and 
      conditional state, while for soybean rhizosphere, community abundances reach a 
      periodic and permanent distribution state. Dominant dispersal process in 
      rhizosphere, coupled with homogeneous selection, brings evidences that soybean 
      root system selects microbial taxa via trade-offs in order to keep functional 
      resilience of soil processes.

TI  - Plant diversity increases N removal in constructed wetlands when multiple rather 
      than single N processes are considered.
PG  - e01965
LID - 10.1002/eap.1965 [doi]
AB  - Biodiversity has a close relationship with ecosystem functioning. For most 
      biodiversity-ecosystem-functioning studies, biodiversity has been linked to a 
      single indicator variable of ecosystem functioning. However, there are generally 
      multiple ecosystem processes contributing to ecosystem functioning and they 
      differ in their dependence on biodiversity. Thus, the relationship between 
      biodiversity and ecosystem functioning can be stronger when multiple rather than 
      single ecosystem processes are considered. Using both mass-balance and 
      stable-isotope approaches, we explored the effects of plant diversity on nitrogen 
      (N) removal sustained by multiple N-cycling processes in experimental microcosms 
      simulating constructed wetlands, an ecosystem treating wastewater with high N 
      loading. Four species were used to assemble different plant communities, ranging 
      in richness from one to four species. The removal of N, indicated by low levels 
      of total inorganic N concentration (TIN) present in the effluent, was considered 
      as an integrated measure of ecosystem functioning, combining three constituent 
      N-cycling processes: plant uptake, denitrification, and substrate adsorption. Our 
      results showed that (1) species richness had a positive effect on N removal, in 
      particular, the four-species mixture reduced effluent TIN to a lower level than 
      any monoculture; however, polycultures (two-, three-, and four-species mixtures) 
      did not outperform the most efficient monoculture when each of the three 
      constituent N-cycling processes was considered by itself; (2) species identity 
      had significant impacts on single processes. Communities with the species Coix 
      lacryma-jobi showed the greatest capacity for N uptake and communities with 
      Phragmites australis had the highest denitrification rates; (3) isotope 
      fractionation in the rhizosphere of Coix lacryma-jobi was primarily due to 
      microbial denitrification while multistep isotope fractionation was detected for 
      Phragmites australis and Acorus calamus (indicating recycling of N), suggesting 
      that species differed in the way they transformed N; (4) the enhanced N removal 
      at high diversity may be due to mutualistic interactions among species belonging 
      to different functional types. Our findings demonstrated that although plant 
      species richness had negligible effects on individual N-cycling processes, it 
      enhanced the overall ecosystem functioning (N removal) when these processes were 
      considered collectively. Our study thus contributes to improve the treatment 
      efficiency of constructed wetlands through proper vegetation management.

AB  - Understanding how patterns of recovery and geological conditions affect microbial 
      communities is important for determining the stability of karst ecosystems. Here, 
      we investigated the diversity and composition of microorganisms in karst and 
      non-karst environments under natural restoration and artificial rehabilitation 
      conditions. The results showed no significant differences in soil microbial 
      diversity, but the microbial communities associated with geological conditions 
      and tree species differed significantly. Variation partitioning analysis (VPA) 
      showed that a total of 77.3% of the variation in bacteria and a total of 69.3% of 
      the variation in fungi could be explained by vegetation type and geological 
      background. There were significant differences in six bacterial classes 
      (Actinobacteria, Alphaproteobacteria, Ktedonobacteria, TK10, Gammaproteobacteria, 
      and Anaerolineae) and nine fungal classes (Eurotiomycetes, Agaricomycetes, 
      unclassified _p_Ascomycota, Sordariomycetes, Tremellomycetes, norank_k_Fungi, 
      Pezizomycetes, Leotiomycetes and Archaeorhizomycetes) among the soils collected 
      from six plots. A Spearman correlation heatmap showed that the microbial 
      community was affected by the major soil properties. Principal coordinates 
      analysis indicated that the microbial community of Pinus yunnanensis in the 
      artificial forest, which was established for the protection of the environment 
      was most similar to that in the natural secondary forest in the karst ecosystem. 
      These findings further our understanding of microbial responses to vegetation 
      restoration and geological conditions.

TI  - The DNRA-Denitrification Dichotomy Differentiates Nitrogen Transformation 
      Pathways in Mountain Lake Benthic Habitats.

AB  - Effects of nitrogen (N) deposition on microbially-driven processes in 
      oligotrophic freshwater ecosystems are poorly understood. We quantified guilds in 
      the main N-transformation pathways in benthic habitats of 11 mountain lakes along 
      a dissolved inorganic nitrogen gradient. The genes involved in denitrification 
      (nirS, nirK, nosZ), nitrification (archaeal and bacterial amoA), dissimilatory 
      nitrate reduction to ammonium (DNRA, nrfA) and anaerobic ammonium oxidation 
      (anammox, hdh) were quantified, and the bacterial 16S rRNA gene was sequenced. 
      The dominant pathways and associated bacterial communities defined four main 
      N-transforming clusters that differed across habitat types. DNRA dominated in the 
      sediments, except in the upper layers of more productive lakes where nirS 
      denitrifiers prevailed with potential N(2)O release. Loss as N(2) was more likely 
      in lithic biofilms, as indicated by the higher hdh and nosZ abundances. Archaeal 
      ammonia oxidisers predominated in the isoetid rhizosphere and rocky littoral 
      sediments, suggesting nitrifying hotspots. Overall, we observed a change in 
      potential for reactive N recycling via DNRA to N losses via denitrification as 
      lake productivity increases in oligotrophic mountain lakes. Thus, N deposition 
      results in a shift in genetic potential from an internal N accumulation to an 
      atmospheric release in the respective lake systems, with increased risk for N(2)O 
      emissions from productive lakes.

TI  - Effects of Agricultural Management on Rhizosphere Microbial Structure and 
      Function in Processing Tomato Plants.
LID - 10.1128/AEM.01064-19 [doi]
LID - e01064-19
AB  - Agricultural management practices affect bulk soil microbial communities and the 
      functions they carry out, but it remains unclear how these effects extend to the 
      rhizosphere in different agroecosystem contexts. Given close linkages between 
      rhizosphere processes and plant nutrition and productivity, understanding how 
      management practices impact this critical zone is of great importance to optimize 
      plant-soil interactions for agricultural sustainability. A comparison of six 
      paired conventional-organic processing tomato farms was conducted to investigate 
      relationships between management, soil physicochemical parameters, and 
      rhizosphere microbial community composition and functions. Organically managed 
      fields were higher in soil total N and NO(3)-N, total and labile C, plant Ca, S, 
      and Cu, and other essential nutrients, while soil pH was higher in conventionally 
      managed fields. Differential abundance, indicator species, and random forest 
      analyses of rhizosphere communities revealed compositional differences between 
      organic and conventional systems and identified management-specific microbial 
      taxa. Phylogeny-based trait prediction showed that these differences translated 
      into more abundant pathogenesis-related gene functions in conventional systems. 
      Structural equation modeling revealed a greater effect of soil biological 
      communities than physicochemical parameters on plant outcomes. These results 
      highlight the importance of rhizosphere-specific studies, as plant selection 
      likely interacts with management in regulating microbial communities and 
      functions that impact agricultural productivity.IMPORTANCE Agriculture relies, in 
      part, on close linkages between plants and the microorganisms that live in 
      association with plant roots. These rhizosphere bacteria and fungi are distinct 
      from microbial communities found in the rest of the soil and are even more 
      important to plant nutrient uptake and health. Evidence from field studies shows 
      that agricultural management practices such as fertilization and tillage shape 
      microbial communities in bulk soil, but little is known about how these practices 
      affect the rhizosphere. We investigated how agricultural management affects 
      plant-soil-microbe interactions by comparing soil physical and chemical 
      properties, plant nutrients, and rhizosphere microbial communities from paired 
      fields under organic and conventional management. Our results show that human 
      management effects extend even to microorganisms living in close association with 
      plant roots and highlight the importance of these bacteria and fungi to crop 
      nutrition and productivity.

TI  - Antifungal potential of Lauraceae rhizobacteria from a tropical montane cloud

PG  - 583-592
LID - 10.1007/s42770-019-00094-2 [doi]
AB  - The occurrence of pests and diseases can affect plant health and productivity in 
      ecosystems that are already at risk, such as tropical montane cloud forests. The 
      use of naturally occurring microorganisms is a promising alternative to mitigate 
      forest tree fungal pathogens. The objectives of this study were to isolate 
      rhizobacteria associated with five Lauraceae species from a Mexican tropical 
      montane cloud forest and to evaluate their antifungal activity against Fusarium 
      solani and F. oxysporum. Fifty-six rhizobacterial isolates were assessed for 
      mycelial growth inhibition of Fusarium spp. through dual culture assays. 
      Thirty-three isolates significantly reduced the growth of F. solani, while 21 
      isolates inhibited that of F. oxysporum. The nine bacterial isolates that 
      inhibited fungal growth by more than 20% were identified through 16S rDNA gene 
      sequence analysis; they belonged to the genera Streptomyces, Arthrobacter, 
      Pseudomonas, and Staphylococcus. The volatile organic compounds (VOC) produced by 
      these nine isolates were evaluated for antifungal activity. Six isolates 
      (Streptomyces sp., Arthrobacter sp., Pseudomonas sp., and Staphylococcus spp.) 
      successfully inhibited F. solani mycelial growth by up to 37% through VOC 
      emission, while only the isolate INECOL-21 (Pseudomonas sp.) inhibited F. 
      oxysporum. This work provides information on the microbiota of Mexican Lauraceae 
      and is one of the few studies identifying forest tree-associated microbes with 
      inhibitory activity against tree pathogens.

AB  - Phytomining of nickel (Ni) is based on the cropping of Ni hyperaccumulators on 
      Ni-rich serpentine soils. The efficiency of this approach is dependent on shoot 
      nickel concentration and harvestable biomass. In a field experiment conducted on 
      an Austrian serpentine site, the phytomining efficiency of the two plant species 
      Odontarrhena chalcidica (syn. Alyssum murale) and Noccaea goesingensis was 
      evaluated. O. chalcidica was planted in three treatments: control, sulphur 
      application (0.46 g S kg(-1) soil) and intercropping with the legume Lotus 
      corniculatus. For N. goesingensis the treatments control, high-density planting 
      (110 plants m(-2)) and intercropping were implemented. Given the experimental 
      set-up, shoot biomass, shoot Ni concentration and thus the total amount of 
      harvested Ni were on average higher for O. chalcidica. The highest Ni yield was 
      achieved with O. chalcidica, reaching 55 kg Ni ha(-1) in the sulphur treatment. 
      N. goesingensis showed the maximum yield in the high-density treatment with 36 kg 
      Ni ha(-1). However, high-density planting of N. goesingensis and sulphur 
      application to O. chalcidica plots did not significantly increase the Ni yield 
      compared to the control. Intercropping with L. corniculatus tended to decrease 
      the shoot biomass of both species. Planting of the hyperaccumulators led to a 
      decrease of DTPA-extractable Ni and to an increase of soil pH, with the exception 
      of sulphur-amended plots. Likewise, rhizosphere soil pH was higher than bulk soil 
      values. Our data suggest that in particular O. chalcidica is suitable for Ni 
      phytomining on the tested site. Measures to further increase the Ni yield and to 
      optimise crop management will be evaluated in follow-up experiments.

TI  - Dwelling in the deep - strongly increased root growth and rooting depth enhance 
      plant interactions with thawing permafrost soil.

AB  - Climate-warming-induced permafrost thaw exposes large amounts of carbon and 
      nitrogen in soil at considerable depths, below the seasonally thawing active 
      layer. The extent to which plant roots can reach and interact with these hitherto 
      detached, deep carbon and nitrogen stores remains unknown. We aimed to quantify 
      how permafrost thaw affects root dynamics across soil depths and plant functional 
      types compared with above-ground abundance, and potential consequences for 
      plant-soil interactions. A decade of experimental permafrost thaw strongly 
      increased total root length and growth in the active layer, and deep roots 
      invaded the newly thawed permafrost underneath. Root litter input to soil across 
      all depths was 10 times greater with permafrost thaw. Root growth timing was 
      unaffected by experimental permafrost thaw but peaked later in deeper soil, 
      reflecting the seasonally receding thaw front. Deep-rooting species could 
      sequester (15) N added at the base of the ambient active layer in October, which 
      was after root growth had ceased. Deep soil organic matter that has long been 
      locked up in permafrost is thus no longer detached from plant processes upon 
      thaw. Whether via nutrient uptake, carbon storage, or rhizosphere priming, plant 
      root interactions with thawing permafrost soils may feed back on our climate both 
      positively and negatively.

TI  - Plant species identity and soil characteristics determine rhizosphere soil 
      bacteria community composition in European temperate forests.
LID - fiz063 [pii]
LID - 10.1093/femsec/fiz063 [doi]
AB  - Soil bacteria and understorey plants interact and drive forest ecosystem 
      functioning. Yet, knowledge about biotic and abiotic factors that affect the 
      composition of the bacterial community in the rhizosphere of understorey plants 
      is largely lacking. Here, we assessed the effects of plant species identity 
      (Milium effusum vs. Stachys sylvatica), rhizospheric soil characteristics, 
      large-scale environmental conditions (temperature, precipitation and nitrogen (N) 
      deposition), and land-use history (ancient vs. recent forests) on bacterial 
      community composition in rhizosphere soil in temperate forests along a 1700 km 
      latitudinal gradient in Europe. The dominant bacterial phyla in the rhizosphere 
      soil of both plant species were Acidobacteria, Actinobacteria and Proteobacteria. 
      Bacterial community composition differed significantly between the two plant 
      species. Within plant species, soil chemistry was the most important factor 
      determining soil bacterial community composition. More precisely, soil acidity 
      correlated with the presence of multiple phyla, e.g. Acidobacteria (negatively), 
      Chlamydiae (negatively) and Nitrospirae (positively), in both plant species. 
      Large-scale environmental conditions were only important in S. sylvatica and 
      land-use history was not important in either of the plant species. The observed 
      role of understorey plant species identity and rhizosphere soil characteristics 
      in determining soil bacterial community composition extends our understanding of 
      plant-soil bacteria interactions in forest ecosystem functioning.

AB  - The present study elucidated whether roots of temperate forest trees can take up 
      organic phosphorus in the form of ATP. Detached non-mycorrhizal roots of beech 
      (Fagus sylvatica) and gray poplar (Populus x canescens) were exposed under 
      controlled conditions to (33)P-ATP and/or (13)C/(15)N labeled ATP in the presence 
      and absence of the acid phosphatase inhibitor MoO(4) (2-). Accumulation of the 
      respective label in the roots was used to calculate (33)P, (13)C and (15)N uptake 
      rates in ATP equivalents for comparison reason. The present data shown that a 
      significant part of ATP was cleaved outside the roots before phosphate (P(i)) was 
      taken up. Furthermore, nucleotide uptake seems more reasonable after cleavage of 
      at least one P(i) unit as ADP, AMP and/or as the nucleoside adenosine. Similar 
      results were obtained when still attached mycorrhizal roots of adult beech trees 
      and their natural regeneration of two forest stands were exposed to ATP in the 
      presence or absence of MoO(4) (2-). Cleavage of P(i) from ATP by enzymes commonly 
      present in the rhizosphere, such as extracellular acid phosphatases, ecto-apyrase 
      and/or nucleotidases, prior ADP/AMP/adenosine uptake is highly probable but 
      depended on the soil type and the pH of the soil solution. Although uptake of 
      ATP/ADP/AMP cannot be excluded, uptake of the nucleoside adenosine without 
      breakdown into its constituents ribose and adenine is highly evident. Based on 
      the (33)P, (13)C, and (15)N uptake rates calculated as equivalents of ATP the 
      'pro and contra' for the uptake of nucleotides and nucleosides is discussed. 
      Short Summary Roots take up phosphorus from ATP as P(i) after cleavage but might 
      also take up ADP and/or AMP by yet unknown nucleotide transporter(s) because at 
      least the nucleoside adenosine as N source is taken up without cleavage into its 
      constituents ribose and adenine.

      Avicennia marina forest.

AB  - A Gram-staining negative, aerobic, motile and rod-shaped bacterium, designated 
      ZQ330(T), was isolated from rhizosphere soil of a mangrove (Avicennia marina) 
      forest of Zhangzhou, Fujian Province, China. The growth range of NaCl 
      concentration was 0.5-10.0 % (w/v), with an optimum at 2.5-3.0 % (w/v), the 
      temperature range for growth was 10-40  degrees C, with an optimum at 28-30  degrees C, the pH 
      range for growth was pH 6.0-9.5, with an optimum at pH 7.5. Phylogenetic analysis 
      based on 16S rRNA gene sequences revealed that strain ZQ330(T) exhibited less 
      than 97.0 % sequence similarity to all type strains with validly published names 
      and revealed that strain ZQ330(T) formed a distinct lineage in the genus 
      Idiomarina. The average nucleotide identity, and in silico DNA-DNA hybridization 
      values between strain ZQ330(T) and the reference strains were 64.8-69.9 % and 
      27.5-28.4 %, respectively. Chemotaxonomic analysis indicated that the main 
      respiratory quinone was Q-8, the predominant cellular fatty acids were 
      iso-C15 : 0, iso-C17 : 0, summed feature 9 (C16 : 0 10-methyl and/or 
      iso-C17 : 1omega9c), iso-C15 : 1F, C16 : 0, C18 : 0, summed feature 3 (C16 : 1omega8c 
      and/or iso-C16 : 1 2-OH) and summed feature 8 (C18 : 1omega6c and/or C18 : 1omega7c). The 
      polar lipid profile was composed of diphosphatidylglycerol, 
      phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylglycerol, an unidentified glycolipid, an 
      unidentified aminolipid, an unidentified phospholipid and two unidentified 
      lipids. Based on the genotypic, phenotypic, chemotaxonomic and phylogenetic 
      features, strain ZQ330(T) is considered to represent a novel species, for which 
      the name Idiomarina mangrovi sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is ZQ330(T) 
      (=MCCC 1K03495(T)=KCTC 62455(T)).

TI  - Rhizosphere effects on soil microbial community structure and enzyme activity in 
      a successional subtropical forest.
LID - fiz043 [pii]
LID - 10.1093/femsec/fiz043 [doi]
AB  - Forest succession is a central ecological topic due to the importance of its 
      dynamic process for terrestrial ecosystems. However, we have limited knowledge of 
      the relationship between forest succession and belowground microbiota, 
      particularly regarding interactions in the rhizosphere. Here, we determined 
      microbial community structure and biomass using phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA) 
      biomarkers and microbial activity using extracellular enzyme activity in bulk and 
      rhizosphere soils from three successional stages of subtropical forests in 
      eastern China. Principal component analysis of PLFAs indicated distinct soil 
      microbial communities among different successional stages and habitat locations. 
      Specifically for the topsoil, we found the total microbial biomass, bacterial 
      biomass and enzyme activities showed higher levels in the late than early stage, 
      with a significant succession-induced accentuated rhizosphere effect. The 
      increase in total microbial biomass and activity coincided with a net growth in 
      bacterial rather than fungal biomass, indicating a model in which microbial 
      biomass carrying capacity and activity could be affected by the creation or 
      expansion of niches for certain functional group rather than by a rebalancing of 
      competitive interactions among these groups. Furthermore, we demonstrated that 
      forest succession significantly influenced enzyme activity via the changes in 
      microbial biomass, as driven by edaphic factors. Overall, our study deepens the 
      mechanistic understanding of forest recovery by linking soil microbial community 
      and activity along successional chronosequences.

TI  - Archaeal community succession with fine root growth in poplar plantation.

AB  - The archaeal community structure in the rhizosphere soils might change with root 
      growth, which is of great importance for understanding the interaction between 
      roots and microbes. According to root colors, three groups of rhizosphere soils 
      from first-order fine roots of poplar trees (Populus x euramericana) were 
      sampled, including rhizosphere soils surrounding newly born roots (white color, 
      WR), mature roots (yellow color, YR) and aged roots (brown color, BR). Total 
      microbial DNA was extracted from the soils associated with poplar fine roots. The 
      specific primers were used to amplify the 16S rDNA V4-V5 region of soil archaea, 
      and the Illumina MiSeq platform was used for high-throughput sequencing analysis. 
      The results showed that the observed OTU (operational taxonomic unit) abundance 
      of archaeal community in WR and BR rhizosphere soils were similar, while the OTU 
      abundance in YR rhizosphere soil were lower. The WR and BR shared 134 OTUs of 
      archea, the YR and BR shared 87 OTUs, and the WR and BR shared 90 OTUs. The Chao1 
      index and the ACE index of archaeal community in YR rhizosphere soil were 
      significantly lower than those of WR and BR, while the Simpson index and the 
      Shannon index of BR were significantly lower than WR to YR. Results from the 
      PERMANOVA analysis showed that archaeal community compositions in WR and BR 
      rhizosphere soils were significantly different. Species annotation showed that 
      there were 12 genera of archea in three rhizosphere soils, five genera in WR, 10 
      genera in YR, and six genera in BR, respectively. The similarity of the archaeal 
      community composition in poplar rhizosphere soils gradually decreased from WR to 
      BR, with large differences among different growth stages of fine roots. The 
      dominant genus was Candidatus_Nitrososphaera, with a relative abundance of more 
      than 70%, indicating this archaea group might be closely related to poplar fine 
      roots development.

AB  - Due to the ability of soil bacteria to solubilize minerals, fix N2 and mobilize 
      nutrients entrapped in the organic matter, their role in nutrient turnover and 
      plant fitness is of high relevance in forest ecosystems. Although several authors 
      have already studied the organic matter decomposing enzymes produced by soil and 
      plant root-interacting bacteria, most of the works did not account for the 
      activity of cell wall-attached enzymes. Therefore, the enzyme deployment strategy 
      of three bacterial collections (genera Luteibacter, Pseudomonas and Arthrobacter) 
      associated with Quercus spp. roots was investigated by exploring both cell-bound 
      and freely-released hydrolytic enzymes. We also studied the potential of these 
      bacterial collections to produce enzymes involved in the transformation of plant 
      and fungal biomass. Remarkably, the cell-associated enzymes accounted for the 
      vast majority of the total activity detected among Luteibacter strains, 
      suggesting that they could have developed a strategy to maintain the 
      decomposition products in their vicinity, and therefore to reduce the diffusional 
      losses of the products. The spectrum of the enzymes synthesized and the titres of 
      activity were diverse among the three bacterial genera. While cellulolytic and 
      hemicellulolytic enzymes were rather common among Luteibacter and Pseudomonas 
      strains and less detected in Arthrobacter collection, the activity of lipase was 
      widespread among all the tested strains. Our results indicate that a large 
      fraction of the extracellular enzymatic activity is due to cell wall-attached 
      enzymes for some bacteria, and that Quercus spp. root bacteria could contribute 
      at different levels to carbon (C), phosphorus (P) and nitrogen (N) cycles.

AB  - To investigate phosphate-solubilizing characteristics and plant growth-promoting 
      effect of Talaromyces aurantiacus (JXBR04) from Phyllostachys edulis rhizosphere 
      soil, the influence of culture time, carbon sources, nitrogen sources, initial 
      pH, liquid filling volume, and salt ions on phosphate solubilizing ability of 
      strain JXBR04 were examined. The capability to solubilize different types of 
      mineral phosphate was detected using a liquid fermentation method. A pot 
      experiment was conducted to evaluate the effects of strain JXBR04 in promoting 
      the growth of Ph. edulis seedlings. The results showed that strain JXBR04 
      displayed the highest phosphate-dissolving capacity when the cultivation period 
      was 7 days, the initial pH reached 3.5, the volume of liquid was 1/5 or 2/5, and 
      the NaCl concentration was 0 or 1.0 g.L(-1). The phosphate-dissolving ability of 
      the strain was the highest when using sugar as carbon source and yeast powder as 
      nitrogen source. The strain had the greatest ability to solubilize CaHPO(4) with 
      1304.04 mg.L(-1), followed by Ca(3)(PO(4))(2) and FePO(4). We found that 
      available nutrients, leaf, stem, and root phosphorus contents in rhizospheric 
      soil significantly increased in Ph. edulis after 180 days of inoculation with 
      strain JXBR04. In addition, Ph. edulis inoculated with strain JXBR04 had 28.1%, 
      28.3%, and 51.5% higher ground diameter, seedling height, and biomass 
      accumulation than that without JXBR04, respectively. Our findings suggested that 
      T. aurantiacus has the potential to be applied as environment-friendly 
      biofertilizers in maso bamboo forest in the acid soil in southern China.

      in Pinus tabuliformis plantations on Loess Plateau, China].
PG  - 117-126

AB  - Atmospheric nitrogen deposition in China displays a pronounced 
      southeast-northwest gradient, with a range of ～35 kg&middot;hm(-2)&middot;a(-1) 
      in southern and central China and ～7.55 kg&middot;hm(-2)&middot;a(-1) in the 
      northwest. With the Grain for Green project, the environment of Loess Plateau has 
      been greatly improved in the past decades. Little is known about how nitrogen 
      deposition impacts the soil microbial communities in plantations in this region. 
      In order to investigate the responses of diversity and structure of soil 
      microbial community in Pinus tabuliformis plantations to nitrogen addition on 
      Loess Plateau, China, we used high-throughput sequencing of 16S ribosomal RNA 
      genes of bacteria and ITS genes of fungi to investigate the effects of nitrogen 
      addition (200 kg N&middot;hm(-2)&middot;a(-1)) on the bacterial and fungal 
      community over a 40-year chronosequence of coniferous P. tabuliformis plantation 
      forests. After nitrogen addition, the Shannon diversity of both bacteria and 
      fungi significantly increased in the 25-year-old stand, while the abundance-based 
      coverage estimator of bacteria increased significantly in the 40-year-old stand. 
      Nitrogen addition enhanced the relative abundance of Bacteroidetes in the 
      40-year-old stand and that of Acidobacteria/Zygomycota in the 25-year-old stand. 
      In contrast, the relative abundance of Thaumarchaeota was reduced by nitrogen 
      addition in the 40-year old stand. The effects of nitrogen addition were stronger 
      on bacterial than on fungal community structure as indicated by the results from 
      non-metric multidimensional scaling analysis. Moreover, the effects of nitrogen 
      addition were stronger in the 25-year-old stand than in the 40-year-old stand. 
      These results indicated that the effects of nitrogen addition on microbial 
      community structure diminished over time in temperate forests on Loess Plateau, 
      China. The stronger effects of nitrogen addition was found on the community 
      structure of bacteria than that of fungi, and on the microbial community 
      structure in the 25-year-old stand than in the 40-year-old stand. Our findings 
      suggested that forest ecosystem at a certain stage (～40-year old) would be less 
      sensitive to disturbance such as nitrogen addition than young forests.

AB  - Hydrological cycle is expected to become the primary cause of ecosystem's 
      degradation in near future under changing climate. Rain manipulation experiments 
      under field conditions provide accurate picture on the responses of biotic 
      processes to changed water availability for plants. A field experiment, mimicking 
      expected changes in rain patterns, was established in a Mediterranean shrub 
      community at Porto Conte, Italy, in 2001. In November 2011 Cistus monspeliensis, 
      one of the dominating shrub species in the Mediterranean basin, was (13)C 
      labelled on plots subjected to extended rain shortage period and on control non 
      manipulated plots. Carbon (C) allocation was traced by (13)C dynamics in shoots, 
      shoot-respired CO(2), roots, microbial biomass, K(2)SO(4)-extractable C and CO(2) 
      respired from soil. Most of the recovered (13)C (60%) was respired by shoots 
      within 2weeks in control plots. In rain shortage treatment, (13)C remained 
      incorporated in aboveground plant parts. Residence time of (13)C in leaves was 
      longer under the rain shortage because less (13)C was lost by shoot respiration 
      and because (13)C was re-allocated to leaves from woody tissues. The belowground 
      C sink was weak (3-4% of recovered (13)C) and independent on rain manipulation. 
      Extended rain shortage promoted C exudation into rhizosphere soil in expense of 
      roots. Together with lowered photosynthesis, this "save" economy of new C 
      metabolites reduces the growing season under rain shortage resulting in decrease 
      of shrub cover and C losses from the system on the long-term.

AB  - In terrestrial ecosystems, plants interact with diverse taxonomic groups of 
      bacteria and fungi in the phyllosphere and rhizosphere. Although recent studies 
      based on high-throughput DNA sequencing have drastically increased our 
      understanding of plant-associated microbiomes, we still have limited knowledge of 
      how plant species in a species-rich community differ in their leaf and root 
      microbiome compositions. In a cool-temperate semi-natural grassland in Japan, we 
      compared leaf- and root-associated microbiomes across 137 plant species belonging 
      to 33 plant orders. Based on the whole-microbiome inventory data, we analyzed how 
      sampling season as well as the taxonomy, nativeness (native or alien), lifeform 
      (herbaceous or woody), and mycorrhizal type of host plants could contribute to 
      variation in microbiome compositions among co-occurring plant species. The data 
      also allowed us to explore prokaryote and fungal lineages showing preferences for 
      specific host characteristics. The list of microbial taxa showing significant 
      host preferences involved those potentially having some impacts on survival, 
      growth, or environmental resistance of host plants. Overall, this study provides 
      a platform for understanding how plant and microbial communities are linked with 
      each other at the ecosystem level.

AB  - Understanding the abundance and diversity of fungal entomopathogens associated 
      with plant species is critical for improving their field efficacy as microbial 
      insecticides. Metarhizium is a cosmopolitan entomopathogenic fungus, with some 
      species in this genus showing rhizosphere competencies. This study sought to 
      determine the abundance and diversity of Metarhizium spp. in rhizosphere soils of 
      wild plants in a field in Japan. Metarhizium spp. were detected in 76.2% of 151 
      rhizosphere soil samples collected from 41 plant species using a plating method. 
      The mean density of Metarhizium spp. in rhizosphere soils was 1.2 x 10(4) colony 
      forming units/g soil [base 10 logarithm of the mean = 4.06 (S.D. = 0.88)]. There 
      was no significant difference in the densities and detection rates between 
      Asteraceae and Poaceae as well as among two aster and one grass species. The 
      fungal isolates were identified as five species, of which M. pingshaense was the 
      most frequently detected and abundant species. No significant specific 
      associations were recognised between the isolated Metarhizium spp. and the 
      examined aster and grass species. Our findings demonstrated the high occurrence 
      and abundance of M. pingshaense in rhizosphere soils of wild plants at the 
      sampling site irrespective of host plant taxa.

TI  - Differences in Distribution of Potassium-Solubilizing Bacteria in Forest and 
      Plantation Soils in Myanmar.
LID - 10.3390/ijerph16050700 [doi]
LID - 700
AB  - Potassium (K) has been recognized as an essential element in intensive 
      agricultural production systems, and deficiency of K usually results in a 
      decrease in crop yields. The utilization of potassium-solubilizing bacteria (KSB) 
      to increase the soluble K content in soil has been regarded as a desirable 
      pathway to increase plant yields. Following the inoculation of KSB in the soil, 
      potassium can be released (in the form of K(+)) and consumed by plants. This study 
      aims to investigate and compare the distribution characteristics of 
      potassium-solubilizing bacteria between forest and plantation soils in Myanmar. 
      In this study, 14 KSB strains were isolated from rhizosphere samples collected 
      from forest soil, as well as fertilized rubber tree rhizosphere soil and 
      fertilized bare soil from a plantation. Broadleaf forests with high levels of 
      canopy cover mainly comprised the forest environment, and rubber trees were 
      planted in the plantation environment. The Chao and abundance-based coverage 
      estimator (ACE) indices showed that the microbial abundance of the plantation 
      soil was higher than that of the forest soil. According to the Illumina MiSeq 
      sequencing analysis results, the Shannon index of the forest soil was lower while 
      the Simpson index was higher, which demonstrated that the microbial diversity of 
      the forest soil was higher than that of the plantation soil. 
      Potassium-solubilizing test results showed that the strains E, I, M, and N were 
      the most effective KSB under liquid cultivation conditions. Additionally, KSB 
      only accounted for less than 5.47% of the total bacteria detected in either of 
      the sample types, and the distribution of dominant KSB varied with the soil 
      samples. As another result, the abundance of Pseudomonas spp. in S1 was higher 
      than in S2 and S3, indicating a negative impact on the growth of Pseudomonas in 
      the fertilized rubber tree rhizosphere soil. The significance of our research is 
      that it proves that the increasing use of KSB for restoring soil is a good way to 
      reduce the use of chemical fertilizers, which could further provide a relatively 
      stable environment for plant growth.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Ectomycorrhizal fungi (ECM) play a central role in nutrient cycling 
      in boreal and temperate forests, but their role in the soil food web remains 
      little understood. One of the groups assumed to live as specialised mycorrhizal 
      feeders are Protura, but experimental and field evidence is lacking. We used a 
      combination of three methods to test if Protura are specialized mycorrhizal 
      feeders and compared their trophic niche with other soil invertebrates. Using 
      pulse labelling of young beech and ash seedlings we analysed the incorporation of 
      (13)C and (15)N into Acerentomon gallicum. In addition, individuals of Protura 
      from temperate forests were collected for the analysis of neutral lipid fatty 
      acids and natural variations in stable isotope ratios. RESULTS: Pulse labelling 
      showed rapid incorporation of root-derived (13)C, but no incorporation of 
      root-derived (15)N into A. gallicum. The transfer of (13)C from lateral roots to 
      ectomycorrhizal root tips was high, while it was low for (15)N. Neutral lipid 
      fatty acid (NLFA) analysis showed high amounts of bacterial marker (16:1omega7) and 
      plant marker (16:0 and 18:1omega9) fatty acids but not of the fungal membrane lipid 
      18:2omega6,9 in A. gallicum. Natural variations in stable isotope ratios in Protura 
      from a number of temperate forests were distinct from those of the great majority 
      of other soil invertebrates, but remarkably similar to those of sporocarps of ECM 
      fungi. CONCLUSIONS: Using three in situ methods, stable isotope labelling, 
      neutral lipid fatty acid analysis and natural variations of stable isotope 
      ratios, we showed that Protura predominantly feed on mycorrhizal hyphae via 
      sucking up hyphal cytoplasm. Predominant feeding on ectomycorrhizal mycelia by 
      Protura is an exception; the limited consumption of ECM by other soil 
      invertebrates may contribute to carbon sequestration in temperate and boreal 
      forests.

TI  - Amazon forest-to-agriculture conversion alters rhizosphere microbiome composition 
      while functions are kept.

AB  - The conversion of native forest to agriculture is the main cause of microbial 
      biodiversity loss in Amazon soils. In order to better understand this effect, we 
      used metagenomics to investigate microbial patterns and functions in bulk soil 
      and rhizosphere of soybean, in a long-term forest-to-agriculture conversion. 
      Long-term forest-to-agriculture led to microbial homogenization and loss of 
      diversity in both bulk soil and rhizosphere, mainly driven by decreasing aluminum 
      concentration and increased cations saturation in soil, due to liming and 
      fertilization in long-term no-till cropping. Data revealed that long-term no-till 
      cropping culminated in a decrease in Acidobacteria, Actinobacteria and 
      Proteobacteria abundances. However, alpha- and beta-Proteobacteria abundances were 
      higher in the rhizosphere than in bulk soil, regardless of the time after 
      forest-to-agriculture conversion. Changes in functional potential occurred 
      predominantly in bulk soil, with decreases in functions related to potassium 
      metabolism and virulence, disease and defense, while functions related to nucleic 
      acids metabolism increased. Functions in the soybean rhizosphere remained stable, 
      except for those related to potassium metabolism, which decreased after 20-year 
      no-till cropping. Together, our results show that the soybean root system selects 
      microbial taxa via trade-offs, to maintain functional resilience in the 
      rhizosphere microbiome over time.

TI  - The effects of simulated acid rain on internal nutrient cycling and the ratios of 
      Mg, Al, Ca, N, and P in tea plants of a subtropical plantation.
PG  - 99
LID - 10.1007/s10661-019-7248-z [doi]
AB  - Acid rain alters nutrient cycling in tea plantations. However, the acquisition of 
      Mg and Ca by plants and their nutrient interactions with Al, N, and P in response 
      to acid rain are poorly understood. Experimental treatments simulating acid rain 
      at various acidities (pH 4.5, 3.5, and 2.5) were performed within a red soil tea 
      plantation in China. The available Mg, Al, Ca, N, and P were analyzed in the 
      rhizosphere and bulk soils. Further, these elements were measured in absorptive, 
      transportive, and storative roots in addition to twigs, tea, and mature leaves. 
      Available soil Mg and Ca exhibited negative and positive rhizosphere effects, 
      respectively, but the levels of both decreased due to acid rain treatment. In 
      addition, average Mg and Ca concentrations generally decreased in plant tissues 
      with increasing acidity. In contrast, average Al concentration increased across 
      all plant tissues with increasing acidity treatment. Meanwhile, the ratios of 
      Al/Mg and Al/Ca increased with increasing acidity but that of N/Al decreased in 
      twigs and roots. Lastly, the ratios of N/Al, P/Ca, and N/P were all altered by 
      acid treatment in tea and/or mature leaves. Taken together, these results 
      indicated that elevated acidity increased the internal cycling of Al in plants 
      but decreased Mg and Ca fluxes between soils and roots. Further, the response of 
      interactions among the five measured elements to different acidities varied with 
      tea plant tissue. Our findings may advance our understanding of plant adaptation 
      to increasing soil acidification and atmospheric acid deposition around the 
      world.

PG  - 341-348
LID - 10.1080/12298093.2018.1548805 [doi]
AB  - A new species of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (Glomeromycota), Acaulospora 
      koreana, was isolated from forest soils in South Korea. This novel fungus was 
      collected from the rhizosphere of Lindera obtusiloba and Styrax obassia in forest 
      and propagated with Sorghum bicolor in pot. Morphological characteristics of 
      spores of A. koreana are rarely distinguished from Acaulospora mellea, which is 
      reported as one of the most abundant mycorrhizal species in Korea. However, 
      molecular evidence of rDNA sequence using improved primers for glomeromycotan 
      fungal identification strongly supported that A. koreana is different from A. 
      mellea but also any other species belonging to the genus Acaulospora. This is the 
      first novel glomeromycatan fungus introduced in South Korea, but it suggests that 
      there is a high possibility for discovering new arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi 
      considering the abundance of plant species and advanced phylogenetic analysis 
      technique.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Plants, fungi, and bacteria form complex, mutually-beneficial 
      communities within the soil environment. In return for photosynthetically derived 
      sugars in the form of exudates from plant roots, the microbial symbionts in these 
      rhizosphere communities provide their host plants access to otherwise 
      inaccessible nutrients in soils and help defend the plant against biotic and 
      abiotic stresses. One role that bacteria may play in these communities is that of 
      Mycorrhizal Helper Bacteria (MHB). MHB are bacteria that facilitate the 
      interactions between plant roots and symbiotic mycorrhizal fungi and, while the 
      effects of MHB on the formation of plant-fungal symbiosis and on plant health 
      have been well documented, the specific molecular mechanisms by which MHB drive 
      gene regulation in plant roots leading to these benefits remain largely 
      uncharacterized. RESULTS: Here, we investigate the effects of the bacterium 
      Pseudomonas fluorescens SBW25 (SBW25) on aspen root transcriptome using a 
      tripartite laboratory community comprised of Populus tremuloides (aspen) 
      seedlings and the ectomycorrhizal fungus Laccaria bicolor (Laccaria). We show 
      that SBW25 has MHB activity and promotes mycorrhization of aspen roots by 
      Laccaria. Using transcriptomic analysis of aspen roots under multiple community 
      compositions, we identify clusters of co-regulated genes associated with 
      mycorrhization, the presence of SBW25, and MHB-associated functions, and we 
      generate a combinatorial logic network that links causal relationships in 
      observed patterns of gene expression in aspen seedling roots in a single Boolean 
      circuit diagram. The predicted regulatory circuit is used to infer regulatory 
      mechanisms associated with MHB activity. CONCLUSIONS: In our laboratory 
      conditions, SBW25 increases the ability of Laccaria to form ectomycorrhizal 
      interactions with aspen seedling roots through the suppression of aspen root 
      antifungal defense responses. Analysis of transcriptomic data identifies that 
      potential molecular mechanisms in aspen roots that respond to MHB activity are 
      proteins with homology to pollen recognition sensors. Pollen recognition sensors 
      integrate multiple environmental signals to down-regulate 
      pollenization-associated gene clusters, making proteins with homology to this 
      system an excellent fit for a predicted mechanism that integrates information 
      from the rhizosphere to down-regulate antifungal defense response genes in the 
      root. These results provide a deeper understanding of aspen gene regulation in 
      response to MHB and suggest additional, hypothesis-driven biological experiments 
      to validate putative molecular mechanisms of MHB activity in the aspen-Laccaria 
      ectomycorrhizal symbiosis.

TI  - Pseudomonas mangrovi sp. nov., isolated from mangrove soil.
PG  - 377-383
LID - 10.1099/ijsem.0.003141 [doi]
AB  - A Gram-stain-negative, aerobic, non-motile, short-rod-shaped bacterium, 
      designated as strain TC11(T), was isolated from rhizosphere soil of mangrove 
      forest (Kandeliaobovata) in Fugong village, Zhangzhou, Fujian, China. Strain 
      TC11(T) grew at 15-45  degrees C (optimum, 35  degrees C), 0-8 % (w/v) NaCl (optimum, 1 %, w/v) 
      and pH 5.5-9.5 (optimum, pH 7.5). Phylogenetic analyses revealed that strain 
      TC11(T) belonged to a clade of the genus Pseudomonas and showed the highest 
      sequence similarity of 98.4 % to Pseudomonas fluvialis ASS-1(T), followed by 
      Pseudomonas oleovorans subsp.oleovorans DSM 1045(T) (97.9 %), Pseudomonas 
      indoloxydans JCM 14246(T) (97.7 %), Pseudomonas guguanensis JCM 18416(T)(97.6 %) 
      and Pseudomonas alcaliphila JCM 10630(T) (97.5 %) on the basis of their 16S rRNA 
      gene sequences. The DNA G+C content was 64.3 mol%. In silico DNA-DNA 
      hybridization and average nucleotide identity values between strain TC11(T) and 
      the reference strains were 19-22 % and 72-78 %, respectively. Studies based on 
      the three housekeeping genes, rpoB, gyrB and rpoD, further confirmed that strain 
      TC11(T) is a novel member of the genus Pseudomonas. The major fatty acids of 
      strain TC11(T)were C16 : 0, summed feature 8 (C18 : 1omega6c/C18 : 1omega7c) and summed 
      feature 3 (C16 : 1omega7c/C16 : 1omega6c). The sole isoprenoid quinone was Q-9. The major 
      polar lipids were phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylglycerol and 
      diphosphatidylglycerol. Based on the phenotypic, chemotaxonomic and phylogenetic 
      properties, strain TC11(T) represents a novel species of the genus Pseudomonas, 
      for which the name Pseudomonasmangrovi sp. nov., is proposed. The type strain is 
      TC11(T) (=KCTC 62159=MCCC 1K03499).

TI  - Effects of phenolic acids from ginseng rhizosphere on soil fungi structure, 
      richness and diversity in consecutive monoculturing of ginseng.
PG  - 1788-1794
LID - 10.1016/j.sjbs.2018.07.007 [doi]
AB  - Ginseng yield and quality are seriously compromised by consecutive monoculturing 
      in northeastern China. The imbalance of soil fungi communities and autotoxicity 
      of ginseng are the major factors in consecutive monoculturing ginseng crops. Soil 
      fungal communities were identified using Illumina MiSeq sequencing, applied to 
      soils that consecutively cultured ginseng (CCG) for six years and new forest soil 
      (NFS), or receiving application of phenolic acids (PAs). The CCG field received 
      five treatments with five different phenolic acids, including gallic acid (GA), 
      salicylic acid (SA), 3-phenylpropionic acid (3-PA), benzoic acid (BA) and 
      cinnamic acid (CA), which were detected from ginseng rhizosphere in consecutive 
      cropping soil. Fungal richness, fungi diversity, community composition, relative 
      taxon abundances, root rot disease, and growth rate were compared among the 
      different treatments. 579 fungal operational taxonomic units at 97% ITS sequence 
      identity were found among 201,617 sequence reads derived from 18 separate soil 
      samples. Members of the phylum Ascomycota dominated the soil fungal communities, 
      and putative pathogens, such as Fusarium, Gibberella and Nectriaceae_unclassified 
      which may include the abundant sexual morph of Cylindrocarpon destructans, showed 
      higher relative abundances in the CCG fields. Compared to the CCG and NFS fields, 
      PAs (except CA) enhanced the fungi richness and decreased fungi diversity. 
      Cluster analysis indicated that the PAs (except CA) changed the fungi structure 
      in a uniform way. PAs stimulate root rot disease and enhance disease severity, 
      restricting plant growth. The results suggest that the PAs (except CA) may 
      enhance the fungi richness, decrease the fungi diversity and changed the fungi 
      structure to increase fungal pathogen loads, which could explain the declined 
      yield and quality of ginseng in consecutively monocultured ginseng crops.

TI  - Antibacterial and Antitumor Potential of Actinomycetes Isolated from Mangrove 
      Soil in the Maowei Sea of the Southern Coast of China.
PG  - 1339-1346
AB  - Mangroves are the tidal forest existing in the intertidal zone and usually 
      considered as the special marine ecosystem. In the present study, 452 
      actinomycetes were recovered from nine diferent sites at Maowei Sea Mangrove 
      Reserve in Qinzhou (Guangxi province, China). Among them, Seventy-four strains 
      were purified for 16s RNA gene sequencing and further characterization. The 
      results indicated that the majority of isolates belonged to the genera 
      Streptomyces, including 17 species. Streptomyces sanyensis was the dominant 
      species (31.1%), followed by Streptomyces griseorubens (17.5%), Streptomyces 
      viridobrunneus (10.8%) and other Streptomyces species. Only one rare 
      actinomycete, Stenotrophomonas was discovered. The isolation of actinomycetes was 
      obviously related to the type of soil and edaphic conditions. 
      Rhizosphere-associated soils gave almost 62.2% actinomycete isolates, nearly 
      twice as many as the non-rhizosphere-associated soils. In addition, 20 
      actinomycete strains (27%) presented varied antibacterial activities towards four 
      tested organisms, including two drug-resistant clinical strains (MRSA and VRE), 
      while some species of Streptomyces like S.sanyensis, S.viridobrunneus, 
      S.tanashiensis, S.parvus, S.flavotricini, and S.parvulus exhibited remarkable 
      cytotoxic activities. Further bioinformatical analysis of these 29 bioactive 
      strains for secondary metabolites biosynthetic machineries revealed that 
      nonribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS) was detected in 20 isolates (68.9%), 
      whereas type-I polyketide synthase (PKS-I) and type-II polyketide synthase 
      (PKS-II) were detected in 16 and all of the 29 strains, respectively. Hence, our 
      work demonstrated that actinomycetes from mangroves in Maowei Sea Mangrove 
      Reservewere fascinating reservoirs for antibacterial and antitumor natural 
      products discovery.

AB  - A Gram-stain negative, aromatic compound degrading bacterium, designated strain 
      ASA28(T), was isolated from the rhizosphere soil of a pine tree at Anmyon island, 
      Taean in Korea. Strain ASA28(T) was found to be strictly aerobic, non-motile, 
      short rods which can grow at 15-28  degrees C (optimum, 25-28  degrees C), at pH 5.0-11.0 
      (optimum, pH 7.0) and at salinities of 0-1.0% (w/v) NaCl (optimum, 0% NaCl). 
      Phylogenetic analyses based on 16S rRNA gene sequences indicated that strain 
      ASA28(T) belongs to the genus Sphingobium, showing high sequence similarity to 
      Sphingobium scionense WP01(T) (97.8%), Sphingobium vermicocomposti VC-230(T) 
      (96.8%), Sphingobium yanoikuyae ATCC 51230(T) (96.5%) and Sphingobium 
      herbicidovorans MH(T) (95.6%). The predominant ubiquinone and polyamine 
      components were identified as Q-10 and spermidine, respectively. The major fatty 
      acids were identified as C(18:1)omega7c, C(16:0), C(14:0) 2-OH and C(16:1)omega7c and/or 
      C(15:0) iso 2-OH. The major polar lipids were identified as 
      diphosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylethanolamine, 
      phosphatidylmonomethylethanolamine, phosphatidylcholine, sphingoglycolipid, 
      phosphoglycolipid, four unidentified aminophospholipids, an unidentified 
      aminolipid, two unidentified phospholipids and six unidentified lipids. The DNA 
      G+C content of this novel isolate was determined to be 63.0 mol%. DNA-DNA 
      relatedness between strain ASA28(T) and S. herbicidovorans KCTC 2939(T), S. 
      vermicocomposti DSM 21299(T) and S. scionense DSM 19371(T) was determined to be 
      32 +/- 5%, 30 +/- 4% and 25 +/- 5%, respectively. On the basis of the phylogenetic, 
      phenotypic and chemotaxonomic analyses in this study, strain ASA28(T) is 
      considered to represent a novel species of the genus Sphingobium, for which the 
      name Sphingobium pinisoli sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is ASA28(T) 
      (= KACC 18700(T) = NBRC 112246(T)).

LID - e0208493
AB  - Altitudinal gradients provide valuable information about the effects of 
      environmental variables on changes in species richness and composition as well as 
      the distribution of below ground fungal communities. Since most knowledge in this 
      respect has been gathered on aboveground communities, we focused our study 
      towards the characterization of belowground fungal communities associated with 
      two different ages of Norway spruce (Picea abies) trees along an altitudinal 
      gradient. By sequencing the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region on the 
      Illumina platform, we investigated the fungal communities in a floristically and 
      geologically relatively well explored forest on the slope of Mt. Iseler of the 
      Bavarian Alps. From fine roots and rhizosphere of a total of 90 of Norway spruce 
      trees from 18 plots we detected 1285 taxa, with a range of 167 to 506 (average 
      377) taxa per plot. Fungal taxa are distributed over 96 different orders 
      belonging to the phyla Ascomycota, Basidiomycota, Chrytridiomycota, 
      Glomeromycota, and Mucoromycota. Overall the Agaricales (438 taxa) and 
      Tremellales (81 taxa) belonging to the Basidiomycota and the Hypocreales (65 
      spp.) and Helotiales (61 taxa) belonging to the Ascomycota represented the taxon 
      richest orders. The evaluation of our multivariate generalized mixed models 
      indicate that the altitude has a significant influence on the composition of the 
      fungal communities (p < 0.003) and that tree age determines community diversity 
      (p < 0.05). A total of 47 ecological guilds were detected, of which the 
      ectomycorrhizal and saprophytic guilds were the most taxon-rich. Our ITS amplicon 
      Illumina sequencing approach allowed us to characterize a high fungal community 
      diversity that would not be possible to capture with fruiting body surveys alone. 
      We conclude that it is an invaluable tool for diverse monitoring tasks and 
      inventorying biodiversity, especially in the detection of microorganisms 
      developing very ephemeral and/or inconspicuous fruiting bodies or lacking them 
      all together. Results suggest that the altitude mainly influences the community 
      composition, whereas fungal diversity becomes higher in mature/older trees. 
      Finally, we demonstrate that novel techniques from bacterial microbiome analyses 
      are also useful for studying fungal diversity and community structure in a DNA 
      metabarcoding approach, but that incomplete reference sequence databases so far 
      limit effective identification.

      environments.
PG  - 643-657
LID - 10.1007/s00253-018-9515-2 [doi]
AB  - Mountain soils are challenging environments for all kinds of living things, 
      including plants and microorganisms. Many cold-adapted microorganisms colonizing 
      these extreme soils play important roles as promoters of plant growth and 
      development; for that reason, they are called collectively plant growth-promoting 
      microorganisms (PGPM). Even though there is seldom doubt concerning the 
      usefulness of PGPM to develop eco-friendly bioinoculants, including 
      biofertilizers and biocontrollers, a series of aspects need to be addressed in 
      order to make this technology field-applicable. Among these aspects, the 
      ecological and rhizosphere competences of PGPM are of paramount importance, 
      particularly when considering the development of bioinoculants, well suited for 
      the intensification of mountainous agricultural production. Studies on native, 
      cold-adapted PGPM conducted in the Indian Himalayan region (IHR) and the Tropical 
      Andes (TA) lead nowadays the research in this field. Noticeably, some common 
      themes are emerging. For instance, soils in these mountain environments are 
      colonized by many cold-adapted PGPM able to mobilize soil nutrients and to 
      inhibit growth of plant pathogens. Studies aimed at deeply characterizing the 
      abilities of such PGPM is likely to substantially contribute towards a better 
      crop productivity in mountainous environments. The present review focuses on the 
      importance of this microbial resource to improve crop productivity in IHR and TA. 
      We also present a number of successful examples, which emphasize the 
      effectiveness of some bioinoculants-developed from naturally occurring PGPM-when 
      applied in the field.

AB  - To examine the effects of different cultivation history (5 a,10 a, and 15 a) on 
      soil microbial communities, we used Illumina sequencing to investigate the 
      diversity and structure of soil bacterial and fungal communities from Torreya 
      grandis 'Merrillii' fields. The results showed that bacterial Shannon index, the 
      richness estimators Chao1 and ACE were lower in soil in 15 year-old stand than 
      those in other cultivation histories, while Simpson index showed no significant 
      variation. Results from bacterial community NMDS showed that cultivation history 
      played a vital role in driving the changes of soil bacteria communitiy structure. 
      The bacterial communities in 5 and 10 year-old stand had the similar composition. 
      The variations of bacterial richness and diversity as well as community structure 
      (comprised basically of Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria, Acidobacteria, and 
      Chloroflexi) were significantly correlated with soil organic matters, soil C/N, 
      and total nitrogen. The fungi richness estimators of Chao1 and ACE were 
      significantly decreased with increasing cultivation history. Shannon and Simpson 
      indices were significantly higher in soil with 10 year-old stand than soils with 
      other cultivation history. Fungal NMDS could be clustered in the same era. Fungal 
      communities were comprosed of Ascomycota, Basidiomycota and Zygomycota. Changes 
      in fungal richness/diversity and community structure were mainly controlled by 
      the variation of soil organic matter. In conclusion, the predominant factors 
      affecting soil microbial communities were the cultivation history, soil C/N, 
      total nitrogen and organic matter, respectively.

AB  - Some Bacillus strains function as predominant plant-growth-promoting 
      rhizobacteria. Bacillus cereus 905 is a rod-shaped Gram-positive bacterium 
      isolated from wheat rhizosphere and is a rhizobacterium that exhibits significant 
      plant-growth-promoting effects. Species belonging to the genus Bacillus are 
      observed in numerous different habitats. Several papers on B. cereus are related 
      to pathogens that causes food-borne illness and industrial applications. However, 
      genomic analysis of plant-associated B. cereus has yet to be reported. Here, we 
      conducted a genomic analysis comparing strain 905 with three other B. cereus 
      strains and investigate the genomic characteristics and evolution traits of the 
      species in different niches. The genome sizes of four B. cereus strains range 
      from 5.38 M to 6.40 M, and the number of protein-coding genes varies in the four 
      strains. Comparisons of the four B. cereus strains reveal 3,998 core genes. The 
      function of strain-specific genes are related to carbohydrate, amino acid and 
      coenzyme metabolism and transcription. Analysis of single nucleotide 
      polymorphisms (SNPs) indicates local diversification of the four strains. SNPs 
      are unevenly distributed throughout the four genomes, and function interpretation 
      of regions with high SNP density coincides with the function of strain-specific 
      genes. Detailed analysis indicates that certain SNPs contribute to the formation 
      of strain-specific genes. By contrast, genes related to plant-growth-promoting 
      traits are highly conserved. This study shows the genomic differences between 
      four strains from different niches and provides an in-depth understanding of the 
      genome architecture of these species, thus facilitating genetic engineering and 
      agricultural applications in the future.

AB  - The rhizosphere microbiome is a central determinant of plant performance. 
      Microbiome assembly has traditionally been investigated from a bottom-up 
      perspective, assessing how resources such as root exudates drive microbiome 
      assembly. However, the importance of predation as a driver of microbiome 
      structure has to date largely remained overlooked. Here we review the importance 
      of protists, a paraphyletic group of unicellular eukaryotes, as a key regulator 
      of microbiome assembly. Protists can promote plant-beneficial functions within 
      the microbiome, accelerate nutrient cycling, and remove pathogens. We conclude 
      that protists form an essential component of the rhizosphere microbiome and that 
      accounting for predator-prey interactions would greatly improve our ability to 
      predict and manage microbiome function at the service of plant growth and health.

AB  - Denitrification is considered as the dominant nitrogen (N) removing pathway, 
      however, anaerobic oxidation of ammonium (anammox) also plays a significant part 
      in N loss in agricultural ecosystems. Large N inputs into agricultural soils may 
      stimulate the growth of anammox bacteria, resulting in high activity and 
      diversity of anammox bacteria and subsequent more N loss. In some specific 
      niches, like oxic-anoxic interface, three processes, nitrification, anammox and 
      denitrification couple with each other, and significant anammox reaction could be 
      observed. Soil parameters like pH, dissolved oxygen, salinity, 
      oxidation-reduction potential (ORP), and substrate concentrations impact the 
      anammox process. Here we summarize the current knowledge on anammox activity and 
      contribution to N loss, abundance and diversity of anammox bacteria, factors 
      affecting anammox, and the relationship between anammox and other N loss pathways 
      in agricultural soils. We propose that more investigations are required for (1) 
      the role of anammox to N loss with different agricultural management strategies; 
      (2) microscale research on the coupling of nitrification-anammox-denitrification, 
      that might be a very complex process but ideal model for further studies 
      responsible for N cycling in terrestrial ecosystems; and (3) new methods to 
      estimate differential contributions of anammox, codenitrification and 
      denitrification in total N loss in agricultural ecosystems. New research will 
      provide much needed information to quantify the contribution of anammox in N loss 
      from soils at landscape, ecosystem and global scales.

TI  - Disentangling effects of air and soil temperature on C allocation in cold 
      environments: A (14)C pulse-labelling study with two plant species.
PG  - 7778-7789
LID - 10.1002/ece3.4215 [doi]
AB  - Carbon cycling responses of ecosystems to global warming will likely be stronger 
      in cold ecosystems where many processes are temperature-limited. Predicting these 
      effects is difficult because air and soil temperatures will not change in 
      concert, and will affect above and belowground processes differently. We 
      disentangled above and belowground temperature effects on plant C allocation and 
      deposition of plant C in soils by independently manipulating air and soil 
      temperatures in microcosms planted with either Leucanthemopsis alpina or Pinus 
      mugo seedlings. Daily average temperatures of 4 or 9 degrees C were applied to shoots and 
      independently to roots, and plants pulse-labelled with (14) CO (2). We traced 
      soil CO (2) and (14) CO (2) evolution for 4 days, after which microcosms were 
      destructively harvested and (14)C quantified in plant and soil fractions. In 
      microcosms with L. alpina, net (14)C uptake was higher at 9 degrees C than at 4 degrees C soil 
      temperature, and this difference was independent of air temperature. In warmer 
      soils, more C was allocated to roots at greater soil depth, with no effect of air 
      temperature. In P. mugo microcosms, assimilate partitioning to roots increased 
      with air temperature, but only when soils were at 9 degrees C. Higher soil temperatures 
      also increased the mean soil depth at which (14)C was allocated. Our findings 
      highlight the dependence of C uptake, use, and partitioning on both air and soil 
      temperature, with the latter being relatively more important. The strong 
      temperature-sensitivity of C assimilate use in the roots and rhizosphere supports 
      the hypothesis that cold limitation on C uptake is primarily mediated by reduced 
      sink strength in the roots. We conclude that variations in soil rather than air 
      temperature are going to drive plant responses to warming in cold environments, 
      with potentially large changes in C cycling due to enhanced transfer of 
      plant-derived C to soils.

AB  - The temporal distribution patterns of bacterial communities, as an important 
      group in mountain soil, are affected by various environmental factors. To improve 
      knowledge regarding the successional seasonal dynamics of the mountain soil 
      bacterial communities, the rhizospheric soil of a 30-year-old natural secondary 
      Pinus tabulaeformis forest, located in the high-altitude (1900 m a.s.l.) of the 
      temperate Qinling Mountains, was sampled and studied during four different 
      seasons. The bacterial community composition and structure in the rhizospheric 
      soil were studied using an Illumina MiSeq Sequencing platform. Furthermore, the 
      edaphic properties and soil enzymatic activities (urease, phosphatase, and 
      catalase) were measured in order to identify the main impact factors on the soil 
      bacterial community. According to the results, all of the edaphic properties and 
      soil enzymatic activities were significantly affected by the seasonal changes, 
      except for the C/N ratio. Although the biomasses of soil bacterial communities 
      increased during the summer and autumn (warm seasons), their Shannon diversity 
      and Pielou's evenness were decreased. Proteobacteria, Acidobacteria, 
      Actinobacteria, Planctomycetes, and Bacteroidetes were the predominant bacterial 
      groups in all of the soil samples, and the genera of Ktedonobacter, Sphingobium 
      as well as an unclassified member of the Ktedonobacteria were the keystone taxa. 
      The composition and structure of soil bacterial communities were strongly 
      impacted by the edaphic properties, especially the temperature, moisture, 
      ammoniacal nitrogen, available phosphorus and total phosphorus which were the 
      crucial factors to drive the temporal distribution of the soil bacterial 
      community and diversity. In conclusion, the soil temperature, moisture and the 
      nutrients N and P were the crucial edaphic factors for shaping the rhizospheric 
      soil bacterial communities as season and climate change in a P. tabulaeformis 
      forest of Qinling Mountains.

TI  - Frankia communities at revegetating sites in Mt. Ontake, Japan.
PG  - 91-99
LID - 10.1007/s10482-018-1151-4 [doi]
AB  - In 1984 at Mt. Ontake in Japan, an earthquake caused a devastating landslide, and 
      as a result, the vegetation on the south slope of the mountain was completely 
      eliminated. In higher elevation (2000 m) areas, revegetation has not yet been 
      completed even 30 years after the landslide. Revegetation progress throughout the 
      area was heterogeneous. In the partially revegetated areas, actinorhizal plant 
      species such as Alnus maximowiczii and Alnus matsumurae have been found. In the 
      present study, we investigated the Frankia communities in the higher-elevation 
      area using sequence analysis of the amplified nifH (dinitrogenase reductase) gene 
      from nodule and soil samples collected in the disturbed region, undisturbed 
      forest, and in the boundary between the disturbed region and the undisturbed 
      forest. Phylogenetic analysis of partial nifH sequences revealed the presence of 
      six clusters, each of which consisted of highly similar (> 99%) sequences. Four 
      clusters showed significant sequence similarity to Frankia (three Alnus- and a 
      Casuarina-infecting strains). Diversity in the Frankia community was relatively 
      low-only one or two clusters were detected in a site. At most of the sampling 
      sites, a dominant cluster in a nodule coincided with that in rhizosphere soil, 
      indicating that community structure in the rhizosphere is a primary factor that 
      determines occupancy in a nodule. No significant difference in community 
      structure was observed between plant species. Diversity in the Frankia community 
      varied depending on revegetation progress. Cluster A, which was the most dominant 
      in the disturbed region, was likely to have invaded from undisturbed forest.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Bacteria, archaea, viruses and fungi live in various plant 
      compartments including leaves and roots. These plant-associated microbial 
      communities have many effects on host fitness and function. Global climate change 
      is impacting plant species distributions, a phenomenon that will affect 
      plant-microbe interactions both directly and indirectly. In order to predict 
      plant responses to global climate change, it will be crucial to improve our 
      understanding of plant-microbe interactions within and at the edge of plant 
      species natural ranges. While microbes affect their hosts, in turn the plant's 
      attributes and the surrounding environment drive the structure and assembly of 
      the microbial communities themselves. However, the patterns and dynamics of these 
      interactions and their causes are poorly understood. METHODS: In this study, we 
      quantified the microbial communities of the leaves and roots of seedlings of the 
      deciduous tree species sugar maple (Acer saccharum Marshall) within its natural 
      range and at the species' elevational range limit at Mont-Megantic, Quebec. Using 
      high-throughput DNA sequencing, we quantified the bacterial and fungal community 
      structure in four plant compartments: the epiphytes and endophytes of leaves and 
      roots. We also quantified endophytic fungal communities in roots. RESULTS: The 
      bacterial and fungal communities of A. saccharum seedlings differ across 
      elevational range limits for all four plant compartments. Distinct microbial 
      communities colonize each compartment, although the microbial communities inside 
      a plant's structure (endophytes) were found to be a subset of the communities 
      found outside the plant's structure (epiphytes). Plant-associated bacterial 
      communities were dominated by the phyla Proteobacteria, Acidobacteria, 
      Actinobacteria and Bacteroidetes while the main fungal taxa present were 
      Ascomycota. DISCUSSION: We demonstrate that microbial communities associated with 
      sugar maple seedlings at the edge of the species' elevational range differ from 
      those within the natural range. Variation in microbial communities differed among 
      plant components, suggesting the importance of each compartment's exposure to 
      changes in biotic and abiotic conditions in determining variability in community 
      structure. These findings provide a greater understanding of the ecological 
      processes driving the structure and diversity of plant-associated microbial 
      communities within and at the edge of a plant species range, and suggest the 
      potential for biotic interactions between plants and their associated microbiota 
      to influence the dynamics of plant range edge boundaries and responses to global 
      change.

AB  - Phosphate-solubilizing fungi (PSF) generally enhance available phosphorus (P) 
      released from soil, which contributes to plants' P requirement, especially in 
      P-limiting regions. In this study, two PSF, TalA-JX04 and AspN-JX16, were 
      isolated from the rhizosphere soil of moso bamboo (Phyllostachys edulis) widely 
      distributed in P-deficient areas in China and identified as Talaromyces 
      aurantiacus and Aspergillus neoniger, respectively. The two PSF were cultured in 
      potato dextrose liquid medium with six types of initial pH values ranging from 
      6.5 to 1.5 to assess acid resistance. Both PSF were incubated in Pikovskaya's 
      liquid media with different pH values containing five recalcitrant P sources, 
      including Ca3(PO4)2, FePO4, CaHPO4, AlPO4, and C6H6Ca6O24P6, to estimate their 
      P-solubilizing capacity. No significant differences were found in the biomass of 
      both fungi grown in media with different initial pH, indicating that these fungi 
      could grow well under acid stress. The P-solubilizing capacity of TalA-JX04 was 
      highest in medium containing CaHPO4, followed by Ca3(PO4)2, FePO4, C6H6Ca6O24P6, 
      and AlPO4 in six types of initial pH treatments, while the recalcitrant 
      P-solubilizing capacity of AspN-JX16 varied with initial pH. Meanwhile, the 
      P-solubilizing capacity of AspN-JX16 was much higher than TalA-JX04. The pH of 
      fermentation broth was negatively correlated with P-solubilizing capacity 
      (p<0.01), suggesting that the fungi promote the dissolution of P sources by 
      secreting organic acids. Our results showed that TalA-JX04 and AspN-JX16 could 
      survive in acidic environments and both fungi had a considerable ability to 
      release soluble P by decomposing recalcitrant P-bearing compounds. The two fungi 
      had potential for application as environment-friendly biofertilizers in 
      subtropical bamboo ecosystem.

TI  - Methanogenic Archaea dominate mature heartwood habitats of Eastern Cottonwood 
      (Populus deltoides).
PG  - 115-121
LID - 10.1111/nph.15346 [doi]
AB  - While recent reports demonstrate that the direct emission of methane from living 
      tree trunks may be a significant terrestrial emission source, there has been 
      debate whether tree emissions are due to transport from soils or produced in the 
      wood environment itself. Reports of methanogens from wood of trees were prominent 
      in the literature 40 years ago but have not been revisited with molecular ecology 
      approaches. We examined communities associated with Populus deltoides using rRNA 
      gene sequence analyses and how these vary with tree and wood properties. Our data 
      indicate that wood environments are dominated by anaerobic microbiomes. 
      Methanogens are prominent in heartwood (mean 34% relative abundance) compared to 
      sapwood environments (13%), and dominant operational taxonomic units (OTUs) were 
      classified as the Methanobacterium sp. Members of the Firmicutes phylum comprised 
      39% of total sequences and were in 42% greater abundance in sapwood over 
      heartwood niches. Tree diameter was the strongest predictor of methanogen 
      abundance, but wood moisture content and pH were also significant predictors of 
      taxon abundance and overall community composition. Unlike microbiomes of the 
      soil, rhizosphere and phyllosphere, wood associated communities are shaped by 
      unique environmental conditions and may be prominent and overlooked sources of 
      methane emissions in temperate forest systems.

AB  - Trees are crucial for sustaining life on our planet. Forests and land devoted to 
      tree crops do not only supply essential edible products to humans and animals, 
      but also additional goods such as paper or wood. They also prevent soil erosion, 
      support microbial, animal, and plant biodiversity, play key roles in nutrient and 
      water cycling processes, and mitigate the effects of climate change acting as 
      carbon dioxide sinks. Hence, the health of forests and tree cropping systems is 
      of particular significance. In particular, soil/rhizosphere/root-associated 
      microbial communities (known as microbiota) are decisive to sustain the fitness, 
      development, and productivity of trees. These benefits rely on processes aiming 
      to enhance nutrient assimilation efficiency (plant growth promotion) and/or to 
      protect against a number of (a)biotic constraints. Moreover, specific members of 
      the microbial communities associated with perennial tree crops interact with soil 
      invertebrate food webs, underpinning many density regulation mechanisms. This 
      review discusses belowground microbiota interactions influencing the growth of 
      tree crops. The study of tree-(micro)organism interactions taking place at the 
      belowground level is crucial to understand how they contribute to processes like 
      carbon sequestration, regulation of ecosystem functioning, and nutrient cycling. 
      A comprehensive understanding of the relationship between roots and their 
      associate microbiota can also facilitate the design of novel sustainable 
      approaches for the benefit of these relevant agro-ecosystems. Here, we summarize 
      the methodological approaches to unravel the composition and function of 
      belowground microbiota, the factors influencing their interaction with tree 
      crops, their benefits and harms, with a focus on representative examples of 
      Biological Control Agents (BCA) used against relevant biotic constraints of tree 
      crops. Finally, we add some concluding remarks and suggest future perspectives 
      concerning the microbiota-assisted management strategies to sustain tree crops.

TI  - 16S rDNA Profiling to Reveal the Influence of Seed-Applied Biostimulants on the 
      Rhizosphere of Young Maize Plants.
LID - 10.3390/molecules23061461 [doi]
LID - 1461
AB  - In an open field trial on two agricultural soils in NW Italy, the impact of two 
      seed-applied biostimulants on the rhizosphere bacterial community of young maize 
      plants was evaluated. The 16S rDNA profiling was carried out on control and 
      treated plant rhizosphere samples collected at the 4-leaf stage and on bulk soil. 
      In both soils, the rhizospheres were significantly enriched in Proteobacteria, 
      Actinobacteria, and Bacteriodetes, while the abundances of Acidobacteria, 
      Cloroflexi and Gemmatimonadetes decreased compared with bulk soil. Among the 
      culturable bacteria genera that showed an increase by both biostimulants, most 
      are known to be beneficial for nutrient uptake, such as Opitutus, Chryseolinea, 
      Terrimonas, Rhodovastum, Cohnella, Pseudoduganella and the species 
      Anaeromyxobacter dehalogenans; others are known to be involved in root growth, 
      such as Niastella, Labrys, Chloroflexia and Thermomonas; or in plant defence, 
      such as Ohtaekwangia, Quadrisphaera, Turneriella, and Actinoallomurus. Both 
      biostimulants were also found to stimulate gen. Nannocystis, a potential 
      biocompetitive agent against aflatoxigenic Aspergillus moulds. Under controlled 
      conditions, both biostimulants enhanced the shoot and root biomass at the 4(-)5 
      leaf stage. We conclude that the biostimulants do not decrease the biodiversity 
      of the microbial community rhizosphere of young maize plants, but stimulate rare 
      bacterial taxa, some involved in plant growth and pathogen resistance, a result 
      that may have implications in improving crop management.

AB  - In spite of its importance for agriculture and 30 years of genetic studies, the 
      phosphate-starvation signaling pathway, that allows plants to detect, respond, 
      and adapt to changes in the phosphate concentration of the rhizosphere, remains 
      poorly known. Chemical genetics has been increasingly and successfully used as a 
      complementary approach to genetics for the dissection of signaling pathways in 
      diverse organisms. Screens can be designed to identify chemicals interfering 
      specifically with a pathway of interest. We designed a screen that led to the 
      discovery of the first chemical capable to induce specifically the 
      phosphate-starvation signaling pathway in Arabidopsis thaliana. This procedure, 
      described here, can be adapted for the discovery of inducers or repressors of 
      other pathways.

AB  - The study on microbial community composition in rhizosphere soils surrounding 
      different order roots is of great significance for understanding the interactions 
      between roots and microbes. Using Illumina Miseq sequencing technology, this 
      study analyzed the differences of fungal community structure in bulk soils and 
      rhizosphere soils surrounding different root orders of poplar (Populus x 
      euramericana 'Neva') tree. The microbial species annotation showed that 128, 124, 
      130 and 101 fungal genera were classified in the rhizosphere soils around 1-2 
      order roots (R1), 3 order roots (R2), 4-5 order roots (R3) and in the bulk soils 
      (NR), respectively. The differences of present fungal genera indicated a 
      selectivity mechanism driving fungal community assembly in poplar rhizosphere 
      soils. There were seven fungal genera with more than 1% of relative abundance in 
      rhizosphere soils. Trichoderma was the dominant fungal genus in R1. Trichosporon 
      and Aspergillus were the dominant fungal genera in R2 and R3, respectively. Alpha 
      (alpha) diversity indices showed that the fungal diversity was significantly 
      different among root orders. Specifically, the diversity of soil fungal community 
      in the rhizosphere soils around lower order roots was significantly higher than 
      that of higher order roots (P＜0.05). Beta (beta) diversity indices showed that the 
      dissimilarity of fungal community composition increased along with the root 
      orders. All these results implied the different composition and structure of 
      fungal community are closely related with the function of fine root orders.

AB  - AIMS: We imaged the sub-mm distribution of labile P and pH in the rhizosphere of 
      three plant species to localize zones and hot spots of P depletion and 
      accumulation along individual root axes and to relate our findings to nutrient 
      acquisition / root exudation strategies in P-limited conditions at different soil 
      pH, and to mobilization pattern of other elements (Al, Fe, Ca, Mg, Mn) in the 
      rhizosphere. METHODS: Sub-mm distributions of labile elemental patterns were 
      sampled using diffusive gradients in thin films and analysed using laser ablation 
      inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry. pH images were taken using planar 
      optodes. RESULTS: We found distinct patterns of highly localized labile P 
      depletion and accumulation reflecting the complex interaction of plant P 
      acquisition strategies with soil pH, fertilizer treatment, root age, and elements 
      (Al, Fe, Ca) that are involved in P biogeochemistry in soil. We show that the 
      plants respond to P deficiency either by acidification or alkalization, depending 
      on initial bulk soil pH and other factors of P solubility. CONCLUSIONS: P 
      solubilization activities of roots are highly localized, typically around root 
      apices, but may also extend towards the extension / root hair zone.

LID - 263
AB  - Humic substances (HSs) have considerable effects on soil fertility and crop 
      productivity owing to their unique physiochemical and biochemical properties, and 
      play a vital role in establishing biotic and abiotic interactions within the 
      plant rhizosphere. A comprehensive understanding of the mode of action and tissue 
      distribution of HS is, however, required, as this knowledge could be useful for 
      devising advanced rhizospheric management practices. These substances trigger 
      various molecular processes in plant cells, and can strengthen the plant's 
      tolerance to various kinds of abiotic stresses. HS manifest their effects in 
      cells through genetic, post-transcriptional, and post-translational modifications 
      of signaling entities that trigger different molecular, biochemical, and 
      physiological processes. Understanding of such fundamental mechanisms will 
      provide a better perspective for defining the cues and signaling crosstalk of HS 
      that mediate various metabolic and hormonal networks operating in plant systems. 
      Various regulatory activities and distribution strategies of HS have been 
      discussed in this review.

AB  - Arbuscular mycorrhizal and ectomycorrhizal symbioses are among the most important 
      drivers of terrestrial ecosystem dynamics. Historically, the two types of 
      symbioses have been investigated separately because arbuscular mycorrhizal and 
      ectomycorrhizal plant species are considered to host discrete sets of fungal 
      symbionts (i.e., arbuscular mycorrhizal and ectomycorrhizal fungi, respectively). 
      Nonetheless, recent studies based on high-throughput DNA sequencing technologies 
      have suggested that diverse non-mycorrhizal fungi (e.g., endophytic fungi) with 
      broad host ranges play roles in relationships between arbuscular mycorrhizal and 
      ectomycorrhizal plant species in forest ecosystems. By analyzing an Illumina 
      sequencing dataset of root-associated fungi in a temperate forest in Japan, we 
      statistically examined whether co-occurring arbuscular mycorrhizal (Chamaecyparis 
      obtusa) and ectomycorrhizal (Pinus densiflora) plant species could share 
      non-mycorrhizal fungal communities. Among the 919 fungal operational taxonomic 
      units (OTUs) detected, OTUs in various taxonomic lineages were statistically 
      designated as "generalists," which associated commonly with both coniferous 
      species. The list of the generalists included fungi in the genera Meliniomyces, 
      Oidiodendron, Cladophialophora, Rhizodermea, Penicillium, and Mortierella. 
      Meanwhile, our statistical analysis also detected fungi preferentially associated 
      with Chamaecyparis (e.g., Pezicula) or Pinus (e.g., Neolecta). Overall, this 
      study provides a basis for future studies on how arbuscular mycorrhizal and 
      ectomycorrhizal plant species interactively drive community- or ecosystem-scale 
      processes. The physiological functions of the fungi highlighted in our 
      host-preference analysis deserve intensive investigations for understanding their 
      roles in plant endosphere and rhizosphere.

TI  - Vascular plant-mediated controls on atmospheric carbon assimilation and peat 
      carbon decomposition under climate change.
PG  - 3911-3921
LID - 10.1111/gcb.14140 [doi]
AB  - Climate change can alter peatland plant community composition by promoting the 
      growth of vascular plants. How such vegetation change affects peatland carbon 
      dynamics remains, however, unclear. In order to assess the effect of vegetation 
      change on carbon uptake and release, we performed a vascular plant-removal 
      experiment in two Sphagnum-dominated peatlands that represent contrasting stages 
      of natural vegetation succession along a climatic gradient. Periodic measurements 
      of net ecosystem CO(2) exchange revealed that vascular plants play a crucial role 
      in assuring the potential for net carbon uptake, particularly with a warmer 
      climate. The presence of vascular plants, however, also increased ecosystem 
      respiration, and by using the seasonal variation of respired CO(2) radiocarbon 
      (bomb-(14) C) signature we demonstrate an enhanced heterotrophic decomposition of 
      peat carbon due to rhizosphere priming. The observed rhizosphere priming of peat 
      carbon decomposition was matched by more advanced humification of dissolved 
      organic matter, which remained apparent beyond the plant growing season. Our 
      results underline the relevance of rhizosphere priming in peatlands, especially 
      when assessing the future carbon sink function of peatlands undergoing a shift in 
      vegetation community composition in association with climate change.

TI  - Rhizosphere priming effects on soil carbon and nitrogen dynamics among tree 
      species with and without intraspecific competition.
PG  - 1036-1048
LID - 10.1111/nph.15074 [doi]
AB  - Rhizosphere priming effects (RPEs) play a central role in modifying soil organic 
      matter mineralization. However, effects of tree species and intraspecific 
      competition on RPEs are poorly understood. We investigated RPEs of three tree 
      species (larch, ash and Chinese fir) and the impact of intraspecific competition 
      of these species on the RPE by growing them at two planting densities for 140 d. 
      We determined the RPE on soil organic carbon (C) decomposition, gross and net 
      nitrogen (N) mineralization and net plant N acquisition. Differences in the RPE 
      among species were associated with differences in plant biomass. Gross N 
      mineralization and net plant N acquisition increased, but net N mineralization 
      decreased, as the RPE on soil organic C decomposition increased. Intraspecific 
      competition reduced the RPE on soil organic C decomposition, gross and net N 
      mineralization, and net plant N acquisition, especially for ash and Chinese fir. 
      Microbial N mining may explain the overall positive RPEs across species, whereas 
      intensified plant-microbe competition for N may have reduced the RPE with 
      intraspecific competition. Overall, the species-specific effects of tree species 
      play an important role in modulating the magnitude and mechanisms of RPEs and the 
      intraspecific competition on soil C and N dynamics.

TI  - Nothophytophthora gen. nov., a new sister genus of Phytophthora from natural and 
      semi-natural ecosystems.
PG  - 143-174
LID - 10.3767/persoonia.2017.39.07 [doi]
AB  - During various surveys of Phytophthora diversity in Europe, Chile and Vietnam 
      slow growing oomycete isolates were obtained from rhizosphere soil samples and 
      small streams in natural and planted forest stands. Phylogenetic analyses of 
      sequences from the nuclear ITS, LSU, beta-tubulin and HSP90 loci and the 
      mitochondrial cox1 and NADH1 genes revealed they belong to six new species of a 
      new genus, officially described here as Nothophytophthora gen. nov., which 
      clustered as sister group to Phytophthora. Nothophytophthora species share 
      numerous morphological characters with Phytophthora: persistent (all 
      Nothophytophthora spp.) and caducous (N. caduca, N. chlamydospora, N. valdiviana, 
      N. vietnamensis) sporangia with variable shapes, internal differentiation of 
      zoospores and internal, nested and extended (N. caduca, N. chlamydospora) and 
      external (all Nothophytophthora spp.) sporangial proliferation; smooth-walled 
      oogonia with amphigynous (N. amphigynosa) and paragynous (N. amphigynosa, N. 
      intricata, N. vietnamensis) attachment of the antheridia; chlamydospores (N. 
      chlamydospora) and hyphal swellings. Main differing features of the new genus are 
      the presence of a conspicuous, opaque plug inside the sporangiophore close to the 
      base of most mature sporangia in all known Nothophytophthora species and 
      intraspecific co-occurrence of caducity and non-papillate sporangia with internal 
      nested and extended proliferation in several Nothophytophthora species. 
      Comparisons of morphological structures of both genera allow hypotheses about the 
      morphology and ecology of their common ancestor which are discussed. Production 
      of caducous sporangia by N. caduca, N. chlamydospora and N. valdiviana from 
      Valdivian rainforests and N. vietnamensis from a mountain forest in Vietnam 
      suggests a partially aerial lifestyle as adaptation to these humid habitats. 
      Presence of tree dieback in all forests from which Nothophytophthora spp. were 
      recovered and partial sporangial caducity of several Nothophytophthora species 
      indicate a pathogenic rather than a saprophytic lifestyle. Isolation tests from 
      symptomatic plant tissues in these forests and pathogenicity tests are urgently 
      required to clarify the lifestyle of the six Nothophytophthora species.

TI  - Interactions among plants, bacteria, and fungi reduce extracellular enzyme

AB  - Atmospheric nitrogen (N) deposition has enhanced soil carbon (C) stocks in 
      temperate forests. Most research has posited that these soil C gains are driven 
      primarily by shifts in fungal community composition with elevated N leading to 
      declines in lignin degrading Basidiomycetes. Recent research, however, suggests 
      that plants and soil microbes are dynamically intertwined, whereby plants send C 
      subsidies to rhizosphere microbes to enhance enzyme production and the 
      mobilization of N. Thus, under elevated N, trees may reduce belowground C 
      allocation leading to cascading impacts on the ability of microbes to degrade 
      soil organic matter through a shift in microbial species and/or a change in 
      plant-microbe interactions. The objective of this study was to determine the 
      extent to which couplings among plant, fungal, and bacterial responses to N 
      fertilization alter the activity of enzymes that are the primary agents of soil 
      decomposition. We measured fungal and bacterial community composition, 
      root-microbial interactions, and extracellular enzyme activity in the 
      rhizosphere, bulk, and organic horizon of soils sampled from a long-term 
      (>25 years), whole-watershed, N fertilization experiment at the Fernow 
      Experimental Forest in West Virginia, USA. We observed significant declines in 
      plant C investment to fine root biomass (24.7%), root morphology, and arbuscular 
      mycorrhizal (AM) colonization (55.9%). Moreover, we found that declines in 
      extracellular enzyme activity were significantly correlated with a shift in 
      bacterial community composition, but not fungal community composition. This 
      bacterial community shift was also correlated with reduced AM fungal colonization 
      indicating that declines in plant investment belowground drive the response of 
      bacterial community structure and function to N fertilization. Collectively, we 
      find that enzyme activity responses to N fertilization are not solely driven by 
      fungi, but instead reflect a whole ecosystem response, whereby declines in the 
      strength of belowground C investment to gain N cascade through the soil 
      environment.

AB  - Characterisation of geochemical transformations and processes in soils with 
      special focus on the rhizosphere is crucial for assessing metal(loid) 
      bioavailability to plants during in situ immobilisation and phytostabilisation. 
      In this study, the effects of nano zero-valent iron (nZVI) were investigated in 
      terms of the immobilisation of As, Zn, Pb and Cd in two soil types and their 
      potential uptake by plants using rhizobox experiments. Such system allowed 
      monitoring the behaviour of trace elements in rooted and bulk soil compartments 
      separately. Sunflower (Helianthus annuus L.) and ryegrass (Lolium perenne L.) 
      were tested for As-rich (15.9 g As kg(-1)) and Zn-rich (4.1 g Zn kg(-1)) soil 
      samples, respectively. The application of nZVI effectively lowered the uptake of 
      all target risk elements into plant tissues. Efficient immobilisation of As was 
      determined in the As-soil without a significant difference between plant and bulk 
      soil compartments. Similarly, a significant decrease was determined for 
      CaCl(2)-available fractions of Zn, Pb and Cd in nZVI-treated Zn-soil. The 
      behaviour of As corresponded to changes in Eh, while Zn and Cd showed to be 
      mainly pH-dependent. However, despite the observed stabilisation effect of nZVI, 
      high amounts of As and Zn still remained available for plants. Furthermore, the 
      accumulation of the target risk elements in roots and the overall effect of nZVI 
      transformations in the rhizosphere were verified and visualised by SEM/EDS. The 
      following immobilising mechanisms were suggested: (i) sorption onto both existing 
      and newly formed Fe (hydr)oxides, (ii) formation of secondary Fe-As phases, and 
      (iii) sorption onto Mn (hydr)oxides.

TI  - Phenolic root exudate and tissue compounds vary widely among temperate forest 
      tree species and have contrasting effects on soil microbial respiration.
PG  - 530-541
LID - 10.1111/nph.15041 [doi]
AB  - Root-soil interactions fundamentally affect the terrestrial carbon (C) cycle and 
      thereby ecosystem feedbacks to climate change. This study addressed the question 
      of whether the secondary metabolism of different temperate forest tree species 
      can affect soil microbial respiration. We hypothesized that phenolics can both 
      increase and decrease respiration depending on their function as food source, 
      mobilizer of other soil resources, signaling compound, or toxin. We analyzed the 
      phenolic compounds from root exudates and root tissue extracts of six tree 
      species grown in a glasshouse using high-performance liquid chromatography. We 
      then tested the effect of individual phenolic compounds, representing the major 
      identified phenylpropanoid compound classes, on microbial respiration through a 
      5-d soil incubation. Phenolic root profiles were highly species-specific. Of the 
      eight classes identified, flavonoids were the most abundant, with flavanols being 
      the predominating sub-class. Phenolic effects on microbial respiration ranged 
      from a 26% decrease to a 46% increase, with reduced respiration occurring in the 
      presence of compounds possessing a catechol ring. Tree species variation in root 
      phenolic composition influences the magnitude and direction of root effects on 
      microbial respiration. Our data support the hypothesis that functional group 
      rather than biosynthetic class determines the root phenolic effect on soil C 
      cycling.

TI  - Effects of land use on arbuscular mycorrhizal fungal communities in Estonia.
PG  - 259-268
LID - 10.1007/s00572-018-0822-3 [doi]
AB  - Arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungal communities vary across habitat types, as well 
      as across different land use types. Most relevant research, however, has focused 
      on agricultural or other severely human-impacted ecosystems. Here, we compared AM 
      fungal communities across six habitat types: calcareous grassland, overgrown 
      ungrazed calcareous grassland, wooded meadow, farmyard lawn, boreonemoral forest, 
      and boreonemoral forest clear-cut, exhibiting contrasting modes of land use. AM 
      fungi in the roots of a single host plant species, Prunella vulgaris, and in its 
      rhizosphere soil were identified using 454-sequencing from a total of 103 samples 
      from 12 sites in Estonia. Mean AM fungal taxon richness per sample did not differ 
      among habitats. AM fungal community composition, however, was significantly 
      different among habitat types. Both abandonment and land use intensification 
      (clearcutting; trampling combined with frequent mowing) changed AM fungal 
      community composition. The AM fungal communities in different habitat types were 
      most similar in the roots of the single host plant species and most distinct in 
      soil samples, suggesting a non-random pattern in host-fungal taxon interactions. 
      The results show that AM fungal taxon composition is driven by habitat type and 
      land use intensity, while the plant host may act as an additional filter between 
      the available and realized AM fungal species pool.

TI  - Clearcutting alters decomposition processes and initiates complex restructuring

PG  - 692-703
LID - 10.1038/s41396-017-0027-3 [doi]
AB  - Forest management practices often severely affect forest ecosystem functioning. 
      Tree removal by clearcutting is one such practice, producing severe impacts due 
      to the total reduction of primary productivity. Here, we assessed changes to 
      fungal community structure and decomposition activity in the soil, roots and 
      rhizosphere of a Picea abies stand for a 2-year period following clearcutting 
      compared to data from before tree harvest. We found that the termination of 
      photosynthate flow through tree roots into soil is associated with profound 
      changes in soil, both in decomposition processes and fungal community 
      composition. The rhizosphere, representing an active compartment of high enzyme 
      activity and high fungal biomass in the living stand, ceases to exist and starts 
      to resemble bulk soil. Decomposing roots appear to separate from bulk soil and 
      develop into hotspots of decomposition and important fungal biomass pools. We 
      found no support for the involvement of ectomycorrhizal fungi in the 
      decomposition of roots, but we found some evidence that root endophytic fungi may 
      have an important role in the early stages of this process. In soil, activity of 
      extracellular enzymes also decreased in the long term following the end of 
      rhizodeposition by tree roots.

AB  - Root exudation is an important input of carbon into soils and affects plant and 
      soil communities, but little is known about the effect of climatic factors such 
      as drought on exudation, and its ability to recover. We studied the impact of 
      increasing drought on root exudation and its subsequent recovery in the 
      Mediterranean tree species Quercus ilex L. in a greenhouse study by measuring the 
      amount of total organic carbon in exudates. The amount of exudation per unit root 
      area increased with drought duration and was 21% higher under the most extreme 
      drought scenario compared with the non-droughted control. The amount of root 
      exudation did not differ between the treatments following 6 weeks of re-watering, 
      indicating a strong capacity for recovery in this species. We concluded that 
      drought could affect the amount of root exudation, which could in turn have a 
      large impact on microbial activity in the rhizosphere, and alter these microbial 
      communities, at least in the short term. This tree species may be able to return 
      to normal levels of root exudation after a drought event, but long-term 
      exudate-mediated impacts on Mediterranean forest soils may be an unforeseen 
      effect of drought.

AB  - Waste incineration bottom ash is considered a secondary resource for valuable 
      trace elements (TE), which is currently neglected in most European countries. 
      Phytomining could potentially recover valuable TE from such waste materials but 
      is still at an exploratory stage with many challenges. The use of bioaugmentation 
      to improve plant growth and TE accumulation of metal-tolerant high biomass plants 
      growing on waste incineration bottom ash was evaluated. Bacterial strains that 
      were previously isolated from rhizosphere, roots and contaminated soil were 
      selected according to their plant growth promoting characteristics and tolerance 
      to the bottom ash substrate. Those selected bacterial strains were tested for 
      their beneficial effects on Nicotiana tabacum and Salix smithiana with regards to 
      phytomining. The rhizobacterial strain Rhodococcus erythropolis P30 enhanced the 
      shoot dry weight of N. tabacum by on average 57% compared to the control plants. 
      Several bacterial inoculants enhanced biomass production and the nutritional 
      status of S. smithiana. Moreover, those bacterial strains previously described to 
      enhance biomass production of N. tabacum and members of the Salicaceae on 
      TE-contaminated soils, also enhanced biomass production of these species on 
      bottom ash. However, bacterial inoculants could not enhance trace element 
      accumulation in plants.

AB  - During surveys of Phytophthora diversity in natural and semi-natural Fagaceae 
      forests in Austria, Italy and Portugal, four new cryptic species were isolated 
      from rhizosphere soil samples. Multigene phylogeny based on nuclear ITS, 
      ss-tubulin and HSP90 and mitochondrial cox1 and NADH1 gene sequences demonstrated 
      that two species, P. tyrrhenica and P. vulcanica spp. nov., belong to 
      phylogenetic Clade 7a, while the other two species, P. castanetorum and P. 
      tubulina spp. nov., clustered together with P. quercina forming a new clade, 
      named here as Clade 12. All four new species are homothallic and have low optimum 
      and maximum temperatures for growth and very slow growth rates at their 
      respective optimum temperature. They differed from each other and from related 
      species by a unique combination of morphological characters, cardinal 
      temperatures, and growth rates. Pathogenicity of all Phytophthora species to the 
      root system of their respective host species was demonstrated in soil infestation 
      trials.

AB  - Evidence is increasing that soil animal food webs are fueled by root-derived 
      carbon (C) and also by root-derived nitrogen (N). Functioning as link between the 
      above- and belowground system, trees and their species identity are important 
      drivers structuring soil animal communities. A pulse labeling experiment using 
      15N and 13C was conducted by exposing beech (Fagus sylvatica) and ash (Fraxinus 
      excelsior) seedlings to 13CO2 enriched atmosphere and tree leaves to 15N ammonium 
      chloride solution in a plant growth chamber under controlled conditions for 72 h. 
      C and N fluxes into the soil animal food web of beech, associated with 
      ectomycorrhizal fungi (EMF), and ash, associated with arbuscular mycorrhizal 
      fungi (AMF), were investigated at two sampling dates (5 and 20 days after 
      labeling). All of the soil animal taxa studied incorporated root-derived C, while 
      root-derived N was only incorporated into certain taxa. Tree species identity 
      strongly affected C and N incorporation with the incorporation in the beech 
      rhizosphere generally exceeding that in the ash rhizosphere. Incorporation 
      differed little between 5 and 20 days after labeling indicating that both C and N 
      are incorporated quickly into soil animals and are used for tissue formation. Our 
      results suggest that energy and nutrient fluxes in soil food webs depend on the 
      identity of tree species with the differences being associated with different 
      types of mycorrhiza. Further research is needed to prove the generality of these 
      findings and to quantify the flux of plant C and N into soil food webs of forests 
      and other terrestrial ecosystems.

TI  - Quantifying the contribution of mass flow to nitrogen acquisition by an 
      individual plant root.
PG  - 119-130
LID - 10.1111/nph.14927 [doi]
AB  - The classic model of nitrogen (N) flux into roots is as a Michaelis-Menten (MM) 
      function of soil-N concentration at root surfaces. Furthermore, soil-N transport 
      processes that determine soil-N concentration at root surfaces are seen as a 
      bottleneck for plant nutrition. Yet, neither the MM relationship nor soil-N 
      transport mechanisms are represented in current terrestrial biosphere models. 
      Processes governing N supply to roots - diffusion, mass flow, N immobilization by 
      soil microbes - are incorporated in a model of root-N uptake. We highlight a 
      seldom considered interaction between these processes: nutrient traverses the 
      rhizosphere more quickly in the presence of mass flow, reducing the probability 
      of its immobilization before reaching the root surface. Root-N uptake is 
      sensitive to the rate of mass flow for widely spaced roots with high N uptake 
      capacity, but not for closely spaced roots or roots with low uptake capacity. The 
      results point to a benefit of root switching from high- to low-affinity N 
      transport systems in the presence of mass flow. Simulations indicate a strong 
      impact of soil water uptake on N delivery to widely spaced roots through 
      transpirationally driven mass flow. Furthermore, a given rate of N uptake per 
      unit soil volume may be achieved by lower root biomass in the presence of mass 
      flow.

TI  - Root and Rhizosphere Bacterial Phosphatase Activity Varies with Tree Species and 
      Soil Phosphorus Availability in Puerto Rico Tropical Forest.
PG  - 1834

AB  - Tropical forests generally occur on highly weathered soils that, in combination 
      with the immobility of phosphorus (P), often result in soils lacking 
      orthophosphate, the form of P most easily metabolized by plants and microbes. In 
      these soils, mineralization of organic P can be the major source for 
      orthophosphate. Both plants and microbes encode for phosphatases capable of 
      mineralizing a range of organic P compounds. However, the activity of these 
      enzymes depends on several edaphic factors including P availability, tree 
      species, and microbial communities. Thus, phosphatase activity in both roots and 
      the root microbial community constitute an important role in P mineralization and 
      P nutrient dynamics that are not well studied in tropical forests. To relate 
      phosphatase activity of roots and bacteria in tropical forests, we measured 
      phosphatase activity in roots and bacterial isolates as well as bacterial 
      community composition from the rhizosphere. Three forests in the Luquillo 
      Mountains of Puerto Rico were selected to represent a range of soil P 
      availability as measured using the resin P method. Within each site, a minimum of 
      three tree species were chosen to sample. Root and bacterial phosphatase activity 
      were both measured using a colorimetric assay with para-nitrophenyl phosphate as 
      a substrate for the phosphomonoesterase enzyme. Both root and bacterial 
      phosphatase were chiefly influenced by tree species. Though tree species was the 
      only significant factor in root phosphatase activity, there was a negative trend 
      between soil P availability and phosphatase activity in linear regressions of 
      average root phosphatase and resin P. Permutational multivariate analysis of 
      variance of bacterial community composition based on 16S amplicon sequencing 
      indicated that bacterial composition was strongly controlled by soil P 
      availability (p-value < 0.05). These results indicate that although root and 
      bacterial phosphatase activity were influenced by tree species; bacterial 
      community composition was chiefly influenced by P availability. Although the 
      sample size is limited given the tremendous diversity of tropical forests, our 
      study indicates the importance of roots and bacterial function to understanding 
      phosphatase activity. Future work will broaden the diversity of tree species and 
      microbial members sampled to provide insight into P mineralization and model 
      representation of tropical forests.

AB  - Pristine forest ecosystems provide a unique perspective for the study of 
      plant-associated microbiota since they host a great microbial diversity. Although 
      the Amazon forest is one of the hotspots of biodiversity around the world, few 
      metagenomic studies described its microbial community diversity thus far. 
      Understanding the environmental factors that can cause shifts in microbial 
      profiles is key to improving soil health and biogeochemical cycles. Here we 
      report a taxonomic and functional characterization of the microbiome from the 
      rhizosphere of Brosimum guianense (Snakewood), a native tree, and bulk soil 
      samples from a pristine Brazilian Amazon forest reserve (Cunia), for the first 
      time by the shotgun approach. We identified several fungi and bacteria taxon 
      significantly enriched in forest rhizosphere compared to bulk soil samples. For 
      archaea, the trend was the opposite, with many archaeal phylum and families being 
      considerably more enriched in bulk soil compared to forest rhizosphere. Several 
      fungal and bacterial decomposers like Postia placenta and Catenulispora 
      acidiphila which help maintain healthy forest ecosystems were found enriched in 
      our samples. Other bacterial species involved in nitrogen (Nitrobacter 
      hamburgensis and Rhodopseudomonas palustris) and carbon cycling (Oligotropha 
      carboxidovorans) were overrepresented in our samples indicating the importance of 
      these metabolic pathways for the Amazon rainforest reserve soil health. 
      Hierarchical clustering based on taxonomic similar microbial profiles grouped the 
      forest rhizosphere samples in a distinct clade separated from bulk soil samples. 
      Principal coordinate analysis of our samples with publicly available metagenomes 
      from the Amazon region showed grouping into specific rhizosphere and bulk soil 
      clusters, further indicating distinct microbial community profiles. In this work, 
      we reported significant shifts in microbial community structure between forest 
      rhizosphere and bulk soil samples from an Amazon forest reserve that are probably 
      caused by more than one environmental factors such as rhizosphere and soil depth.

TI  - Six new Phytophthora species from ITS Clade 7a including two sexually functional 
      heterothallic hybrid species detected in natural ecosystems in Taiwan.
PG  - 100-135
LID - 10.3767/003158517X693615 [doi]
AB  - During a survey of Phytophthora diversity in natural ecosystems in Taiwan six new 
      species were detected. Multigene phylogeny based on the nuclear ITS, ss-tubulin 
      and HSP90 and the mitochondrial cox1 and NADH1 gene sequences demonstrated that 
      they belong to ITS Clade 7a with P. europaea, P. uniformis, P. rubi and P. 
      cambivora being their closest relatives. All six new species differed from each 
      other and from related species by a unique combination of morphological 
      characters, the breeding system, cardinal temperatures and growth rates. Four 
      homothallic species, P. attenuata, P. flexuosa, P. formosa and P. intricata, were 
      isolated from rhizosphere soil of healthy forests of Fagus hayatae, Quercus 
      glandulifera, Q. tarokoensis, Castanopsis carlesii, Chamaecyparis formosensis and 
      Araucaria cunninghamii. Two heterothallic species, P. xheterohybrida and P. 
      xincrassata, were exclusively detected in three forest streams. All P. 
      xincrassata isolates belonged to the A2 mating type while isolates of P. 
      xheterohybrida represented both mating types with oospore abortion rates 
      according to Mendelian ratios (4-33 %). Multiple heterozygous positions in their 
      ITS, ss-tubulin and HSP90 gene sequences indicate that P. xheterohybrida, P. 
      xincrassata and P. cambivora are interspecific hybrids. Consequently, P. 
      cambivora is re-described as P. xcambivora without nomenclatural act. 
      Pathogenicity trials on seedlings of Castanea sativa, Fagus sylvatica and Q. 
      suber indicate that all six new species might pose a potential threat to European 
      forests.

PG  - 14155-14163
LID - 10.1021/acs.est.7b03878 [doi]
AB  - Tropical seagrasses are nutrient-limited owing to the strong phosphorus fixation 
      capacity of carbonate-rich sediments, yet they form densely vegetated, 
      multispecies meadows in oligotrophic tropical waters. Using a novel combination 
      of high-resolution, two-dimensional chemical imaging of O(2), pH, iron, sulfide, 
      calcium, and phosphorus, we found that tropical seagrasses are able to mobilize 
      the essential nutrients iron and phosphorus in their rhizosphere via multiple 
      biogeochemical pathways. We show that tropical seagrasses mobilize phosphorus and 
      iron within their rhizosphere via plant-induced local acidification, leading to 
      dissolution of carbonates and release of phosphate, and via local stimulation of 
      microbial sulfide production, causing reduction of insoluble Fe(III) 
      oxyhydroxides to dissolved Fe(II) with concomitant phosphate release into the 
      rhizosphere porewater. These nutrient mobilization mechanisms have a direct link 
      to seagrass-derived radial O(2) loss and secretion of dissolved organic carbon 
      from the below-ground tissue into the rhizosphere. Our demonstration of 
      seagrass-derived rhizospheric phosphorus and iron mobilization explains why 
      seagrasses are widely distributed in oligotrophic tropical waters.

AB  - Stand density regulation is an important measure of plantation forest management, 
      and phosphorus (P) is often the limiting factor of tree productivity, especially 
      in the subtropics and tropics. However, the stand density influence on ecosystem 
      P cycling is unclear in Chinese fir (Cunninghamia lanceolata) plantations of 
      subtropical China. We collected rhizosphere and bulk soils, leaves and twigs with 
      different ages and roots with different orders to measure P and nitrogen (N) 
      variables in Chinese fir plantations with low density (LDCF) and high density 
      (HDCF) at Fujian and Hunan provinces of subtropical China. Rhizosphere soil 
      labile P, slow P, occluded P and extractable P were higher in LDCF than HDCF at 
      two sites. Meanwhile, P and N concentrations of 1-year-old leaves and twigs were 
      higher in LDCF than HDCF and leaf N/P ratio generally increased with increasing 
      leaf age at two sites. Rhizosphere vs. bulk soil labile P and occluded P were 
      greater in LDCF than HDCF at Fujian. Nitrogen resorption efficiencies (NRE) of 
      leaves and twigs were higher in LDCF than HDCF at Fujian, while their P 
      resorption efficiencies (PRE) were not different between two densities at two 
      sites. The average NRE of leaves (41.7%) and twigs (65.6%) were lower than the 
      corresponding PRE (67.8% and 78.0%, respectively). Our results suggest that 
      reducing stem density in Chinese fir plantations might be helpful to increase 
      soil active P supplies and meet tree nutrient requirements.

AB  - Continuous cropping obstacles resulted in the yield losses of Panax ginseng, and 
      affected the development of ginseng industry. Soil fungal communities 
      participated in the key ecological process, and their changes of diversity and 
      composition were related to the continuous cropping obstacles. We analyzed the 
      changes of fungal diversity and composition in the rhizosphere of ginseng using 
      the high-throughput sequencing method, stated the effects of ginseng cultivation 
      on the micro-ecology, and provided effective strategies for overcoming continuous 
      cropping obstacles. Compared to those of the forest soils, the fungal diversity 
      of ginseng rhizosphere soils was increased, and the increasing trends were 
      declined with an increasing years of ginseng cultivation; the relative abundance 
      of Sordariomycetes, Alatospora, Eurotiomycetes, Leotiomycetes, Saccharomycetes, 
      Mucorales and Pezizomycetes were increased in the rhizosphere of ginseng. 
      Pearson's correlation index indicated that soil chemical perporties affected the 
      relative abundance of fungal communities. pH was significantly related to the 
      relative abundance of Dothideomycetes and Alatospora; the content of available 
      potassium was markedly associated with the relative abundance of Dothideomycetes, 
      Alatospora and Mucorales; the content of total nitrogen was significant 
      correlation with the relative abundance of Sordariomycetes and Mucorales. These 
      results indicated that fertilization was one of pivotal factors affecting the 
      rhizosphere micro-ecology of ginseng, and optimization of fertilization system 
      was an effective method to overcome continuous cropping obstacles.

AB  - Although consecutive monoculture problems have been studied for many years, no 
      effective treatments are currently available. The complexity of systems triggered 
      the formation of consecutive monoculture problems was one major cause. This paper 
      elaborated the physiological and ecological mechanisms of consecutive monoculture 
      problem formation based on the interaction relationship among multiple factors 
      presented in the rhizosphere soil of consecutive monoculture plants. At same 
      time, in this paper the multiple interactions among cultivated medicinal plants, 
      autotoxic allelochemicals and rhizosphere microbial were proposed to be most 
      important causes that derived the formation of consecutive monoculture problem. 
      The paper also highlighted the advantage of 'omics' technologies integrating 
      plant functional genomics and metabolomics as well as microbial macro-omics in 
      understanding the multiple factor interaction under a particular ecological 
      environment. Additionally, taking R. glutinosa as an example, the paper reviewed 
      the molecular mechanism for the formation of R. glutinosa consecutive monoculture 
      problem from the perspective of the accumulation of allelopathic autotoxins, the 
      rhizosphere microecology catastrophe and theresponding of consecutive monoculture 
      plants. Simultaneously, the roles of mutilple 'omics' technologies in 
      comprehending these formation mechanism were described in detail. This paper 
      provides finally a new insight to solve systematically the mechanism of 
      consecutive monoculture problem formation on molecular level.

AB  - We investigated soluble carbohydrate transport in trees that differed in their 
      phloem loading strategies in order to better understand the transport of 
      photosynthetic products into the roots and the rhizosphere as this knowledge is 
      needed to better understand the respiratory processes in the rhizosphere. We 
      compared beech, which is suggested to use mainly passive loading of transport 
      sugars along a concentration gradient into the phloem, with ash that uses active 
      loading and polymer trapping of raffinose family oligosaccharides (RFOs). We 
      pulse-labeled 20 four-year old European beech and 20 four-year old ash trees with 
      13CO2 and tracked the fate of the label within different plant compartments. We 
      extracted soluble carbohydrates from leaves, bark of stems and branches, and fine 
      roots, measured their amount and isotopic content and calculated their turnover 
      times. In beech one part of the sucrose was rapidly transported into sink tissues 
      without major exchange with storage pools whereas another part of sucrose was 
      strongly exchanged with unlabeled possibly stored sucrose. In contrast the 
      storage and allocation patterns in ash depended on the identity of the 
      transported sugars. RFO were the most important transport sugars that had highest 
      turnover in all shoot compartments. However, the turnover of RFOs in the roots 
      was uncoupled from the shoot. The only significant relation between sugars in the 
      stem base and in the roots of ash was found for the amount (r2 = 0.50; p = 0.001) 
      and isotopic content (r2 = 0.47; p = 0.01) of sucrose. The negative relation of 
      the amounts suggested an active transport of sucrose into the roots of ash. 
      Sucrose concentration in the root also best explained the concentration of RFOs 
      in the roots suggesting that RFO in the roots of ash may be resynthesized from 
      sucrose. Our results interestingly suggest that in both tree species only sucrose 
      directly entered the fine root system and that in ash RFOs are transported 
      indirectly into the fine roots only. The direct transport of sucrose might be 
      passive in beech but active in ash (sustained active up- and unloading to 
      co-cells), which would correspond to the phloem loading strategies. Our results 
      give first hints that the transport of carbohydrates between shoot and root is 
      not necessarily continuous and involves passive (beech) and active (ash) 
      transport processes, which may be controlled by the phloem unloading.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Ectomycorrhizal (ECM) fungi develop a mutualistic symbiotic 
      interaction with the roots of their host plants. During this process, they 
      undergo a series of developmental transitions from the running hyphae in the 
      rhizosphere to the coenocytic hyphae forming finger-like structures within the 
      root apoplastic space. These transitions, which involve profound, 
      symbiosis-associated metabolic changes, also entail a substantial transcriptome 
      reprogramming with coordinated waves of differentially expressed genes. To date, 
      little is known about the key transcriptional regulators driving these changes, 
      and the aim of the present study was to delineate and functionally characterize 
      the transcription factor (TF) repertoire of the model ECM fungus Laccaria 
      bicolor. RESULTS: We curated the L. bicolor gene models coding for transcription 
      factors and assessed their expression and regulation in Poplar and Douglas fir 
      ectomycorrhizae. We identified 285 TFs, 191 of which share a significant 
      similarity with known transcriptional regulators. Expression profiling of the 
      corresponding transcripts identified TF-encoding fungal genes differentially 
      expressed in the ECM root tips of both host plants. The L. bicolor core set of 
      differentially expressed TFs consists of 12 and 22 genes that are, respectively, 
      upregulated and downregulated in symbiotic tissues. These TFs resemble known 
      fungal regulators involved in the control of fungal invasive growth, fungal cell 
      wall integrity, carbon and nitrogen metabolism, invasive stress response and 
      fruiting-body development. However, this core set of mycorrhiza-regulated TFs 
      seems to be characteristic of L. bicolor and our data suggest that each 
      mycorrhizal fungus has evolved its own set of ECM development regulators. A 
      subset of the above TFs was functionally validated with the use of a 
      heterologous, transcription activation assay in yeast, which also allowed the 
      identification of previously unknown, transcriptionally active yet secreted 
      polypeptides designated as Secreted Transcriptional Activator Proteins (STAPs). 
      CONCLUSIONS: Transcriptional regulators required for ECM symbiosis development in 
      L. bicolor have been uncovered and classified through genome-wide analysis. This 
      study also identifies the STAPs as a new class of potential ECM effectors, highly 
      expressed in mycorrhizae, which may be involved in the control of the symbiotic 
      root transcriptome.

TI  - Identifying the Active Microbiome Associated with Roots and Rhizosphere Soil of 
      Oilseed Rape.
LID - 10.1128/AEM.01938-17 [doi]
LID - e01938-17
AB  - RNA stable isotope probing and high-throughput sequencing were used to 
      characterize the active microbiomes of bacteria and fungi colonizing the roots 
      and rhizosphere soil of oilseed rape to identify taxa assimilating plant-derived 
      carbon following (13)CO(2) labeling. Root- and rhizosphere soil-associated 
      communities of both bacteria and fungi differed from each other, and there were 
      highly significant differences between their DNA- and RNA-based community 
      profiles. Verrucomicrobia, Proteobacteria, Planctomycetes, Acidobacteria, 
      Gemmatimonadetes, Actinobacteria, and Chloroflexi were the most active bacterial 
      phyla in the rhizosphere soil. Bacteroidetes were more active in roots. The most 
      abundant bacterial genera were well represented in both the (13)C- and (12)C-RNA 
      fractions, while the fungal taxa were more differentiated. Streptomyces, 
      Rhizobium, and Flavobacterium were dominant in roots, whereas Rhodoplanes and 
      Sphingomonas (Kaistobacter) were dominant in rhizosphere soil. "Candidatus 
      Nitrososphaera" was enriched in (13)C in rhizosphere soil. Olpidium and 
      Dendryphion were abundant in the (12)C-RNA fraction of roots; Clonostachys was 
      abundant in both roots and rhizosphere soil and heavily (13)C enriched. 
      Cryptococcus was dominant in rhizosphere soil and less abundant, but was (13)C 
      enriched in roots. The patterns of colonization and C acquisition revealed in 
      this study assist in identifying microbial taxa that may be superior competitors 
      for plant-derived carbon in the rhizosphere of Brassica napusIMPORTANCE This 
      microbiome study characterizes the active bacteria and fungi colonizing the roots 
      and rhizosphere soil of Brassica napus using high-throughput sequencing and 
      RNA-stable isotope probing. It identifies taxa assimilating plant-derived carbon 
      following (13)CO(2) labeling and compares these with other less active groups not 
      incorporating a plant assimilate. Brassica napus is an economically and globally 
      important oilseed crop, cultivated for edible oil, biofuel production, and 
      phytoextraction of heavy metals; however, it is susceptible to several diseases. 
      The identification of the fungal and bacterial species successfully competing for 
      plant-derived carbon, enabling them to colonize the roots and rhizosphere soil of 
      this plant, should enable the identification of microorganisms that can be 
      evaluated in more detailed functional studies and ultimately be used to improve 
      plant health and productivity in sustainable agriculture.

PG  - 419-433

AB  - A central challenge in community ecology is understanding the role that 
      phenotypic variation among genotypes plays in structuring host-associated 
      communities. While recent studies have investigated the relationship between 
      plant genotype and the composition of soil microbial communities, the effect of 
      genotype-by-environment interactions on the plant microbiome remains unclear. In 
      this study, we assessed the influence of tree genetics (G), nitrogen (N) form and 
      genotype-by-environment interaction (G x N) on the composition of the root 
      microbiome. Rhizosphere communities (bacteria and fungi) and root-associated 
      fungi (including ectomycorrhizal and saprotrophic guilds) were characterised in 
      two genotypes of Pinus radiata with contrasting physiological responses to 
      exogenous organic or inorganic N supply. Genotype-specific responses to N form 
      influenced the composition of the root microbiome. Specifically, (1) diversity 
      and composition of rhizosphere bacterial and root-associated fungal communities 
      differed between genotypes that had distinct responses to N form, (2) shifts in 
      the relative abundance of individual taxa were driven by the main effects of N 
      form or host genotype and (3) the root microbiome of the P. radiata genotype with 
      the most divergent growth responses to organic and inorganic N was most sensitive 
      to differences in N form. Our results show that intraspecific variation in tree 
      response to N form has significant consequences for the root microbiome of P. 
      radiata, demonstrating the importance of genotype-by-environment interactions in 
      shaping host-associated communities.

AB  - Nitrification, the oxidation of ammonia via nitrite to nitrate, has always been 
      considered to be catalyzed by the concerted activity of ammonia- and 
      nitrite-oxidizing microorganisms. Only recently, complete ammonia oxidizers 
      ("comammox"), which oxidize ammonia to nitrate on their own, were identified in 
      the bacterial genus Nitrospira, previously assumed to contain only canonical 
      nitrite oxidizers. Nitrospira are widespread in nature, but for assessments of 
      the distribution and functional importance of comammox Nitrospira in ecosystems, 
      cultivation-independent tools to distinguish comammox from strictly 
      nitrite-oxidizing Nitrospira are required. Here we developed new PCR primer sets 
      that specifically target the amoA genes coding for subunit A of the distinct 
      ammonia monooxygenase of comammox Nitrospira. While existing primers capture only 
      a fraction of the known comammox amoA diversity, the new primer sets cover as 
      much as 95% of the comammox amoA clade A and 92% of the clade B sequences in a 
      reference database containing 326 comammox amoA genes with sequence information 
      at the primer binding sites. Application of the primers to 13 samples from 
      engineered systems (a groundwater well, drinking water treatment and wastewater 
      treatment plants) and other habitats (rice paddy and forest soils, rice 
      rhizosphere, brackish lake sediment and freshwater biofilm) detected comammox 
      Nitrospira in all samples and revealed a considerable diversity of comammox in 
      most habitats. Excellent primer specificity for comammox amoA was achieved by 
      avoiding the use of highly degenerate primer preparations and by using equimolar 
      mixtures of oligonucleotides that match existing comammox amoA genes. 
      Quantitative PCR with these equimolar primer mixtures was highly sensitive and 
      specific, and enabled the efficient quantification of clade A and clade B 
      comammox amoA gene copy numbers in environmental samples. The measured relative 
      abundances of comammox Nitrospira, compared to canonical ammonia oxidizers, were 
      highly variable across environments. The new comammox amoA-targeted primers 
      enable more encompassing future studies of nitrifying microorganisms in diverse 
      habitats. For example, they may be used to monitor the population dynamics of 
      uncultured comammox organisms under changing environmental conditions and in 
      response to altered treatments in engineered and agricultural ecosystems.

      variables and biological interactions (biotic factors). To determine whether the 
      aboveground vegetation and soil physicochemical properties were the main 
      determinant of beta-diversity and biological interaction of soil microbial 
      community, we sampled soils from the temperate coniferous forest and grassland. 
      Clustering of operational taxonomic units was conducted using 16S rRNA gene. We 
      found that the microbial composition of the rhizospheres, in which root exudates 
      influence the microbial environment, show lower alpha-diversity than that of 
      nonroot soils. The nonsignificant rhizosphere effect suggested other undetermined 
      factors or stochastic processes accounted for microbial diversity in the 
      rhizosphere. More significant microbe-microbe interactions were observed in 
      forest and rhizosphere soils relative to the grassland soils. The elevated number 
      of positive correlations for relative abundances in forest soil implied 
      beneficial associations being common among bacteria, in particular within the 
      rhizosphere environment. The particular soil properties generated by root 
      exudates also alter the physicochemical properties of soil such as K and pH 
      value, and might in turn favor the adoption of teamwork-cooperation strategies 
      for microbe-microbe interactions, represented as large clusters of positive 
      associations among bacterial taxa. Specific biological interactions 
      differentiated the microbiomes within forest soils. Thus, the environmental 
      selection pressure of aboveground vegetation accounts for differences between 
      soil microbiomes while biotic factors are responsible for fine-scale differences 
      of the microbial community in forest soils.

TI  - Rhizosphere hydrophobicity: A positive trait in the competition for water.
PG  - e0182188

LID - e0182188
AB  - The ability to acquire water from the soil is a major driver in interspecific 
      plant competition and it depends on several root functional traits. One of these 
      traits is the excretion of gel-like compounds (mucilage) that modify physical 
      soil properties. Mucilage secreted by roots becomes hydrophobic upon drying, 
      impedes the rewetting of the soil close to the root, the so called rhizosphere, 
      and reduces water availability to plants. The function of rhizosphere 
      hydrophobicity is not easily understandable when looking at a single plant, but 
      it may constitute a competitive advantage at the ecosystem level. We hypothesize 
      that by making the top soil hydrophobic, deep-rooted plants avoid competititon 
      with shallow-rooted plants. To test this hypothesis we used an individual-based 
      model to simulate water uptake and growth of two virtual plant species, one 
      deep-rooted plant capable of making the soil hydrophobic and a shallow-rooted 
      plant. We ran scenarios with different precipitation regimes ranging from dry to 
      wet (350, 700, and 1400 mm total annual precipitation) and from high to low 
      precipitation frequencies (1, 7, and 14 days). Plant species abundance and 
      biomass were chosen as indicators for competitiveness of plant species. At 
      constant precipitation frequency mucilage hydrophobicity lead to a benefit in 
      biomass and abundance of the tap-rooted population. Under wet conditions this 
      effect diminished and tap-rooted plants were less productive. Without this trait 
      both species coexisted. The effect of root exudation trait remained constant 
      under different precipitation frequencies. This study shows that mucilage 
      secretion is a competitive trait for the acquisition of water. This advantage is 
      achieved by the modification of the soil hydraulic properties and specifically by 
      inducing water repellency in soil regions which are shared with other species.

TI  - Enhanced Degradation of TCE on a Superfund Site Using Endophyte-Assisted Poplar 
      Tree Phytoremediation.
PG  - 10050-10058
LID - 10.1021/acs.est.7b01504 [doi]
AB  - Trichloroethylene (TCE) is a widespread environmental pollutant common in 
      groundwater plumes associated with industrial manufacturing areas. We had 
      previously isolated and characterized a natural bacterial endophyte, Enterobacter 
      sp. strain PDN3, of poplar trees, that rapidly metabolizes TCE, releasing 
      chloride ion. We now report findings from a successful three-year field trial of 
      endophyte-assisted phytoremediation on the Middlefield-Ellis-Whisman Superfund 
      Study Area TCE plume in the Silicon Valley of California. The inoculated poplar 
      trees exhibited increased growth and reduced TCE phytotoxic effects with a 32% 
      increase in trunk diameter compared to mock-inoculated control poplar trees. The 
      inoculated trees excreted 50% more chloride ion into the rhizosphere, indicative 
      of increased TCE metabolism in planta. Data from tree core analysis of the tree 
      tissues provided further supporting evidence of the enhanced rate of degradation 
      of the chlorinated solvents in the inoculated trees. Test well groundwater 
      analyses demonstrated a marked decrease in concentration of TCE and its 
      derivatives from the tree-associated groundwater plume. The concentration of TCE 
      decreased from 300 mug/L upstream of the planted area to less than 5 mug/L 
      downstream of the planted area. TCE derivatives were similarly removed with 
      cis-1,2-dichloroethene decreasing from 160 mug/L to less than 5 mug/L and 
      trans-1,2-dichloroethene decreasing from 3.1 mug/L to less than 0.5 mug/L 
      downstream of the planted trees. 1,1-dichloroethene and vinyl chloride both 
      decreased from 6.8 and 0.77 mug/L, respectively, to below the reporting limit of 
      0.5 mug/L providing strong evidence of the ability of the endophytic inoculated 
      trees to effectively remove TCE from affected groundwater. The combination of 
      native pollutant-degrading endophytic bacteria and fast-growing poplar tree 
      systems offers a readily deployable, cost-effective approach for the degradation 
      of TCE, and may help mitigate potential transfer up the food chain, 
      volatilization to the atmosphere, as well as direct phytotoxic impacts to plants 
      used in this type of phytoremediation.

AB  - In this study, we isolated Bacillus licheniformis MH48 from rhizosphere soil and 
      demonstrated that this strain shows significant antifungal activity against 
      Rhizoctonia solani, Colletotrichum gloeosporioides, and Phytophthora capsici. Our 
      results showed that a 50% concentration of bacterial cell-free culture filtrate 
      of B. licheniformis MH48 shows strong activity against fungal pathogens. Benzoic 
      acid produced by B. licheniformis MH48 was purified by various chromatographic 
      techniques and identified by nuclear magnetic resonance and gas 
      chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis. Benzoic acid displayed antifungal 
      activity against R. solani and C. gloeosporides with minimum inhibitory 
      concentration of 128 mug/mL against mycelial growth. Microscopic examination 
      revealed that benzoic acid (50 mug/mL and 100 mug/mL) transformed 
      C. gloeosporioides conidial morphology and inhibited conidial germination. In 
      addition, benzoic acid (100 mug/mL and 200 mug/mL) degraded R. solani mycelia. 
      Therefore, our results demonstrate that B. licheniformis MH48 strain shows 
      potential for utility as a biological agent for the control of various fungal 
      pathogens of plants.

TI  - The rhizosphere microbiome of burned holm-oak: potential role of the genus 
      Arthrobacter in the recovery of burned soils.

AB  - After a forest wildfire, the microbial communities have a transient alteration in 
      their composition. The role of the soil microbial community in the recovery of an 
      ecosystem following such an event remains poorly understood. Thus, it is 
      necessary to understand the plant-microbe interactions that occur in burned 
      soils. By high-throughput sequencing, we identified the main bacterial taxa of 
      burnt holm-oak rhizosphere, then we obtained an isolate collection of the most 
      abundant genus and its growth promoting activities were characterised. 16S rRNA 
      amplicon sequencing showed that the genus Arthrobacter comprised more than 21% of 
      the total community. 55 Arthrobacter strains were isolated and characterized 
      using RAPDs and sequencing of the almost complete 16S rRNA gene. Our results 
      indicate that isolated Arthrobacter strains present a very high genetic 
      diversity, and they could play an important ecological role in interaction with 
      the host plant by enhancing aerial growth. Most of the selected strains exhibited 
      a great ability to degrade organic polymers in vitro as well as possibly 
      presenting a direct mechanism for plant growth promotion. All the above data 
      suggests that Arthrobacter can be considered as an excellent PGP rhizobacterium 
      that may play an important role in the recovery of burned holm-oak forests.

AB  - Ecosystem carbon (C) balance is hypothesised to be sensitive to the mycorrhizal 
      strategies that plants use to acquire nutrients. To test this idea, we coupled an 
      optimality-based plant nitrogen (N) acquisition model with a microbe-focused soil 
      organic matter (SOM) model. The model accurately predicted rhizosphere processes 
      and C-N dynamics across a gradient of stands varying in their relative abundance 
      of arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) and ectomycorrhizal (ECM) trees. When mycorrhizal 
      dominance was switched - ECM trees dominating plots previously occupied by AM 
      trees, and vice versa - legacy effects were apparent, with consequences for both 
      C and N stocks in soil. Under elevated productivity, ECM trees enhanced 
      decomposition more than AM trees via microbial priming of unprotected SOM. 
      Collectively, our results show that ecosystem responses to global change may 
      hinge on the balance between rhizosphere priming and SOM protection, and 
      highlight the importance of dynamically linking plants and microbes in 
      terrestrial biosphere models.

TI  - Influence of water management on the active root-associated microbiota involved 
      in arsenic, iron, and sulfur cycles in rice paddies.
PG  - 6725-6738
LID - 10.1007/s00253-017-8382-6 [doi]
AB  - In recent years, the role of microorganisms inhabiting rice rhizosphere in 
      promoting arsenic contamination has emerged. However, little is known concerning 
      the species and metabolic properties involved in this phenomenon. In this study, 
      the influence of water management on the rhizosphere microbiota in relation to 
      arsenic dissolution in soil solution was tested. Rice plants were cultivated in 
      macrocosms under different water regimes: continuous flooding, continuous 
      flooding with a 2-week period drainage before flowering, and dry soil watered 
      every 10 days. The active bacterial communities in rhizosphere soil and in 
      rhizoplane were characterized by 16S rRNA pyrosequencing. An in-depth analysis of 
      microbial taxa with direct or indirect effects on arsenic speciation was 
      performed and related contribution was evaluated. Continuous flooding promoted 
      high diversity in the rhizosphere, with the plant strongly determining species 
      richness and evenness. On the contrary, under watering the communities were 
      uniform, with little differences between rhizosphere soil and rhizoplane. 
      Arsenic-releasing and arsenite-methylating bacteria were selected by continuous 
      flooding, where they represented 8% of the total. On the contrary, bacteria 
      decreasing arsenic solubility were more abundant under watering, with relative 
      abundance of 10%. These values reflected arsenic concentrations in soil solution: 
      135 mug L(-1) and negligible in continuous flooding and under watering, 
      respectively. When short-term drainage was applied before flowering, intermediate 
      conditions were achieved. This evidence strongly indicates an active role of the 
      rhizosphere microbiota in driving arsenic biogeochemistry in rice paddies, 
      influenced by water management, explaining amounts and speciation of arsenic 
      often found in rice grains.

TI  - Extensive Overlap of Tropical Rainforest Bacterial Endophytes between Soil, Plant 
      Parts, and Plant Species.
PG  - 88-103
LID - 10.1007/s00248-017-1002-2 [doi]
AB  - The extent to which distinct bacterial endophyte communities occur between 
      different plant organs and species is poorly known and has implications for 
      bioprospecting efforts. Using the V3 region of the bacterial 16S ribosomal RNA 
      (rRNA) gene, we investigated the diversity patterns of bacterial endophyte 
      communities of three rainforest plant species, comparing leaf, stem, and root 
      endophytes plus rhizosphere soil community. There was extensive overlap in 
      bacterial communities between plant organs, between replicate plants of the same 
      species, between plant species, and between plant organ and rhizosphere soil, 
      with no consistent clustering by compartment or host plant species. The 
      non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) analysis highlighted an extensively 
      overlapping bacterial community structure, and the beta-nearest taxon index (betaNTI) 
      analysis revealed dominance of stochastic processes in community assembly, 
      suggesting that bacterial endophyte operational taxonomic units (OTUs) were 
      randomly distributed among plant species and organs and rhizosphere soil. 
      Percentage turnover of OTUs within pairs of samples was similar both for plant 
      individuals of the same species and of different species at around 80-90%. Our 
      results suggest that sampling extra individuals, extra plant organs, extra 
      species, or use of rhizosphere soil, might be about equally effective for 
      obtaining new OTUs for culture. These observations suggest that the plant 
      endophyte community may be much more diverse, but less predictable, than would be 
      expected from culturing efforts alone.

TI  - Adaptive root foraging strategies along a boreal-temperate forest gradient.
PG  - 977-991
LID - 10.1111/nph.14643 [doi]
AB  - The tree root-mycorhizosphere plays a key role in resource uptake, but also in 
      the adaptation of forests to changing environments. The adaptive foraging 
      mechanisms of ectomycorrhizal (EcM) and fine roots of Picea abies, Pinus 
      sylvestris and Betula pendula were evaluated along a gradient from temperate to 
      subarctic boreal forest (38 sites between latitudes 48 degrees N and 69 degrees N) in Europe. 
      Variables describing tree resource uptake structures and processes (absorptive 
      fine root biomass and morphology, nitrogen (N) concentration in absorptive roots, 
      extramatrical mycelium (EMM) biomass, community structure of root-associated EcM 
      fungi, soil and rhizosphere bacteria) were used to analyse relationships between 
      root system functional traits and climate, soil and stand characteristics. 
      Absorptive fine root biomass per stand basal area increased significantly from 
      temperate to boreal forests, coinciding with longer and thinner root tips with 
      higher tissue density, smaller EMM biomass per root length and a shift in soil 
      microbial community structure. The soil carbon (C) : N ratio was found to explain 
      most of the variability in absorptive fine root and EMM biomass, root tissue 
      density, N concentration and rhizosphere bacterial community structure. We 
      suggest a concept of absorptive fine root foraging strategies involving both 
      qualitative and quantitative changes in the root-mycorrhiza-bacteria continuum 
      along climate and soil C : N gradients.

AB  - Global change models indicate that rainfall patterns are likely to shift towards 
      more extreme events concurrent with increasing atmospheric carbon dioxide 
      concentration ([CO(2) ]). Both changes in [CO(2) ] and rainfall regime are known 
      to impact above- and belowground communities, but the interactive effects of 
      these global change drivers have not been well explored, particularly 
      belowground. In this experimental study, we examined the effects of elevated 
      [CO(2) ] (ambient + 240 ppm; [eCO(2) ]) and changes in rainfall patterns 
      (seasonal drought) on soil microbial communities associated with forest 
      ecosystems. Our results show that bacterial and archaeal communities are highly 
      resistant to seasonal drought under ambient [CO(2) ]. However, substantial taxa 
      specific responses to seasonal drought were observed at [eCO(2) ], suggesting 
      that [eCO(2) ] compromise the resistance of microbial communities to extreme 
      events. Within the microbial community we were able to identify three types of 
      taxa specific responses to drought: tolerance, resilience and sensitivity that 
      contributed to this pattern. All taxa were tolerant to seasonal drought at 
      [aCO(2) ], whereas resilience and sensitivity to seasonal drought were much 
      greater in [eCO(2) ]. These results provide strong evidence that [eCO(2) ] 
      moderates soil microbial community responses to drought in forests, with 
      potential implications for their long-term persistence and ecosystem functioning.

AB  - Soil is major reservoir for microbes and harbors a vast microbial diversity. Soil 
      microbiota plays a pivotal role in biogeochemical cycles, bioremediation, and in 
      health and disease states of humans, animals, and plants. It is imperative to 
      understand the microbial signatures which are specific in such an ecosystem to 
      unravel their potential role and impact on environment. During the recent years, 
      exploration of soil microbial communities has been geared up with the advent of 
      advanced sequencing technologies. Introduction of custom-made protocols and 
      optimized procedures have enhanced the accuracy levels along with 
      cost-effectiveness of DNA extraction. Standardization of DNA extraction method 
      from soil microbiota has its own limitations due to different nature of soils and 
      the complexity of ecosystems. Though a few standardized protocols are in usage, 
      huge variations and complexities among the microbial communities frequently 
      suggest the optimization, based on various known and unknown factors. Therefore, 
      a set of four standardized DNA isolation protocols was comparatively analyzed 
      with respect to our custom-made protocol owing to the scientific fact that the 
      same protocol does not hold good for all soil samples. Furthermore, the developed 
      protocol has been successfully applied for the identification of efficient 
      plant-specific Rhizobial stains for five legume plants from the soils of various 
      locations under same geographical region. Out of 40 Badrachalam forest soils, 
      five samples, KPFS36, CHFS17, TPFS33, GVFS06, and GPFS40, one for each of Arachis 
      hypogaea, Vigna radiata, Vigna mungo, Glycine max, and Cicer arietinum plants, 
      were selected, respectively, for the soil DNA extraction. A considerable 
      improvement in the DNA yield was identified using the modified protocol with a 
      yield of 21.08 mug/g providing abundant DNA fragments for further investigation on 
      Rhizobial species.

PG  - 766-778
LID - 10.1111/nph.14603 [doi]
AB  - Increased CO(2) emissions and global warming may alter the composition of fungal 
      communities through the removal of temperature limitation in the plant-soil 
      system, faster nitrogen (N) cycling and changes in the carbon (C) allocation of 
      host plants to the rhizosphere. At a Swiss treeline featuring Larix decidua and 
      Pinus uncinata, the effects of multiple years of CO(2) enrichment and 
      experimental soil warming on the fungal community composition in the organic 
      horizons were analysed using 454-pyrosequencing of ITS2 amplicons. Sporocarp 
      production and colonization of ectomycorrhizal root tips were investigated in 
      parallel. Fungal community composition was significantly altered by soil warming, 
      whereas CO(2) enrichment had little effect. Tree species influenced fungal 
      community composition and the magnitude of the warming responses. The abundance 
      of ectomycorrhizal fungal taxa was positively correlated with N availability, and 
      ectomycorrhizal taxa specialized for conditions of high N availability 
      proliferated with warming, corresponding to considerable increases in inorganic N 
      in warmed soils. Traits related to N utilization are important in determining the 
      responses of ectomycorrhizal fungi to warming in N-poor cold ecosystems. Shifts 
      in the overall fungal community composition in response to higher temperatures 
      may alter fungal-driven processes with potential feedbacks on ecosystem N cycling 
      and C storage at the alpine treeline.

TI  - Enhancement of carbon and nitrogen removal by helophytes along subsurface water 
      flowpaths receiving treated wastewater.

AB  - Wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) effluents are sources of dissolved organic 
      carbon (DOC) and inorganic nitrogen (DIN) to receiving streams, which can 
      eventually become saturated by excess of DIN. Aquatic plants (i.e., helophytes) 
      can modify subsurface water flowpaths as well as assimilate nutrients and enhance 
      microbial activity in the rhizosphere, yet their ability to increase DIN 
      transformation and removal in WWTP-influenced streams is poorly understood. We 
      examined the influence of helophytes on DIN removal along subsurface water 
      flowpaths and how this was associated with DOC removal and labile C availability. 
      To do so, we used a set of 12 flow-through flumes fed with water from a WWTP 
      effluent. The flumes contained solely sediments or sediments with helophytes. 
      Presence of helophytes in the flumes enhanced both DIN and DOC removal. 
      Experimental addition of a labile C source into the flumes resulted in a high 
      removal of the added C within the first meter of the flumes. Yet, no concomitant 
      increases in DIN removal were observed. Moreover, results from laboratory assays 
      showed significant increases in the potential denitrifying enzyme activity of 
      sediment biofilms from the flumes when labile C was added; suggesting 
      denitrification was limited by C quality. Together these results suggest that 
      lack of DIN removal response to the labile C addition in flumes was likely 
      because potential increases in denitrification by biofilms from sediments were 
      counterbalanced by high rates of mineralization of dissolved organic matter. Our 
      results highlight that helophytes can enhance DIN removal in streams receiving 
      inputs from WWTP effluents; and thus, they can become a relevant bioremediation 
      tool in WWTP-influenced streams. However, results also suggest that the quality 
      of DOC from the WWTP effluent can influence the N removal capacity of these 
      systems.

AB  - Arsenic and Cu mobility was investigated in the rhizosphere of Lupinus albus L. 
      grown in an iron-amended contaminated soil. White lupin was grown in rhizobags in 
      contaminated soil either left untreated or amended with iron sulphate plus lime 
      (Fe + lime) or biochar (Fe + BC). Porewater was monitored in rhizosphere and bulk 
      soil throughout the experiment and the extractable fraction of several elements 
      and As and Cu plant uptake was analysed after 48 days. The distribution of As, 
      Cu, P and Fe in the lupin rhizosphere was evaluated with chemical images obtained 
      by laser ablation-ICP-MS analysis of diffusive gradients in thin films (DGT) 
      gels. The treatments effectively reduced the soluble and extractable As and Cu 
      fractions in the bulk soil, but they did not affect plant uptake. In all cases, 
      soluble As was slightly enhanced in the rhizosphere. This difference was more 
      pronounced in the Fe + lime-treated rhizosphere soil, where an increase of pH as 
      well as extractable As and Fe concentrations were also observed. Chemical imaging 
      of the lupin rhizosphere also showed slightly higher As- and Fe-DGT fluxes around 
      lupin roots grown in the non-amended soil. Our findings indicate As and Fe 
      co-solubilisation by lupin root exudates, likely as a response to P deficiency. 
      Arsenic mobilisation occurred only in the rhizosphere and was not decreased by 
      the amendments.

AB  - Arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi form symbioses with the majority of terrestrial 
      plant species, and their community influences many important ecosystem processes, 
      including ecological succession. Understanding the successional changes of AM 
      fungal communities in afforested zones over time is of primary interest in forest 
      ecology. Black locust (Robinia pseudoacacia) has been widely planted on the Loess 
      Plateau of China to prevent soil erosion. We sampled fine roots and rhizosphere 
      soils in black locust plantations consisting of stands of 0, 11, 23, 35 and 
      46years of age to measure soil properties, AM fungal colonization level, and 
      spore density and to describe the composition of AM fungal communities in roots 
      and soils using 454 sequencing. With increasing stand age, AM fungal spore 
      density and soil NO(3)-N and available K contents increased, dehydrogenase and 
      alkaline phosphatase activities decreased, and soil catalase activity and the 
      level of root colonization by arbuscules and hyphae first increased and then 
      decreased. Roots and soils hosted different AM fungal diversity and communities. 
      In soils, AM fungal diversity and community composition did not vary with stand 
      age. In roots, the relative abundance of Claroideoglomus, together with Chao1 
      richness and OTU richness, peaked at the intermediate stage (35years) and then 
      declined, and the relative abundance of Glomus decreased linearly with tree age, 
      whereas the relative abundance of the dominant genus Rhizophagus did not vary 
      with stand age. Soil available K and NO(3)-N largely explained the shift in the 
      structure of the root-colonizing AM fungal community along the chronosequence. 
      Soil enzyme activities were also associated with changes in AM fungal spore 
      abundance and root colonization level. All the results presented here suggest 
      that the successional changes in AM fungal communities in black locust 
      plantations occurring over time can largely be attributed to plantation-induced 
      changes in soil nutrient levels.

AB  - Soil microbes play a fundamental role in forest ecosystems and respond rapidly to 
      changes in the environment. Simultaneously with the temperature increase the 
      climate change scenarios also predict an intensified hydrological cycle for the 
      Baltic Sea runoff region. The aim of this study was to assess the effect of 
      elevated air humidity on the top soil microbial community structure of a silver 
      birch (Betula pendula Roth.) stand by using a free air humidity manipulation 
      facility (FAHM). The bacterial community structures of bulk soil and birch 
      rhizosphere were analyzed using high-throughput sequencing of 
      bacteria-specific16S rRNA gene fragments and quantification of denitrification 
      related genes. The increased air humidity altered both bulk soil and rhizosphere 
      bacterial community structures, and changes in the bacterial communities 
      initiated by elevated air humidity were related to modified soil abiotic and 
      biotic variables. Network analysis revealed that variation in soil bacterial 
      community structural units is explained by altered abiotic conditions such as 
      increased pH value in bulk soil, while in rhizosphere the change in absorptive 
      root morphology had a higher effect. Among root morphological traits, the 
      absorptive root diameter was strongest related to the bacterial community 
      structure. The changes in bacterial community structures under elevated air 
      humidity are associated with shifts in C, N, and P turnover as well as mineral 
      weathering processes in soil. Increased air humidity decreased the nir and nosZ 
      gene abundance in the rhizosphere bacterial community. The potential contribution 
      of the denitrification to the N(2)O emission was not affected by the elevated air 
      humidity in birch stand soil. In addition, the study revealed a strong link 
      between the bacterial community structure, abundance of denitrification related 
      genes, and birch absorptive root morphology in the ecosystem system adaptation to 
      elevated air humidity.

AB  - The ecology of forest soils is an important field of research due to the role of 
      forests as carbon sinks. Consequently, a significant amount of information has 
      been accumulated concerning their ecology, especially for temperate and boreal 
      forests. Although most studies have focused on fungi, forest soil bacteria also 
      play important roles in this environment. In forest soils, bacteria inhabit 
      multiple habitats with specific properties, including bulk soil, rhizosphere, 
      litter, and deadwood habitats, where their communities are shaped by nutrient 
      availability and biotic interactions. Bacteria contribute to a range of essential 
      soil processes involved in the cycling of carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus. They 
      take part in the decomposition of dead plant biomass and are highly important for 
      the decomposition of dead fungal mycelia. In rhizospheres of forest trees, 
      bacteria interact with plant roots and mycorrhizal fungi as commensalists or 
      mycorrhiza helpers. Bacteria also mediate multiple critical steps in the nitrogen 
      cycle, including N fixation. Bacterial communities in forest soils respond to the 
      effects of global change, such as climate warming, increased levels of carbon 
      dioxide, or anthropogenic nitrogen deposition. This response, however, often 
      reflects the specificities of each studied forest ecosystem, and it is still 
      impossible to fully incorporate bacteria into predictive models. The 
      understanding of bacterial ecology in forest soils has advanced dramatically in 
      recent years, but it is still incomplete. The exact extent of the contribution of 
      bacteria to forest ecosystem processes will be recognized only in the future, 
      when the activities of all soil community members are studied simultaneously.

AB  - Diverse communities of bacteria colonize plant roots and the rhizosphere. Many of 
      these rhizobacteria are symbionts and provide plant growth promotion (PGP) 
      services, protecting the plant from biotic and abiotic stresses and increasing 
      plant productivity by providing access to nutrients that would otherwise be 
      unavailable to roots. In return, these symbiotic bacteria receive 
      photosynthetically-derived carbon (C), in the form of sugars and organic acids, 
      from plant root exudates. PGP activities have been characterized for a variety of 
      forest tree species and are important in C cycling and sequestration in 
      terrestrial ecosystems. The molecular mechanisms of these PGP activities, 
      however, are less well-known. In a previous analysis of Pseudomonas genomes, we 
      found that the bacterial transportome, the aggregate activity of a bacteria's 
      transmembrane transporters, was most predictive for the ecological niche of 
      Pseudomonads in the rhizosphere. Here, we used Populus tremuloides Michx. 
      (trembling aspen) seedlings inoculated with one of three Pseudomonas fluorescens 
      strains (Pf0-1, SBW25, and WH6) and one Pseudomonas protegens (Pf-5) as a 
      laboratory model to further investigate the relationships between the predicted 
      transportomic capacity of a bacterial strain and its observed PGP effects in 
      laboratory cultures. Conditions of low nitrogen (N) or low phosphorus (P) 
      availability and the corresponding replete media conditions were investigated. We 
      measured phenotypic and biochemical parameters of P. tremuloides seedlings and 
      correlated P. fluorescens strain-specific transportomic capacities with P. 
      tremuloides seedling phenotype to predict the strain and nutrient 
      environment-specific transporter functions that lead to experimentally observed, 
      strain, and media-specific PGP activities and the capacity to protect plants 
      against nutrient stress. These predicted transportomic functions fall in three 
      groups: (i) transport of compounds that modulate aspen seedling root 
      architecture, (ii) transport of compounds that help to mobilize nutrients for 
      aspen roots, and (iii) transporters that enable bacterial acquisition of C 
      sources from seedling root exudates. These predictions point to specific 
      molecular mechanisms of PGP activities that can be directly tested through 
      future, hypothesis-driven biological experiments.

TI  - Woody-plant ecosystems under climate change and air pollution-response 
      consistencies across zonobiomes?
PG  - 706-732
LID - 10.1093/treephys/tpx009 [doi]
AB  - Forests store the largest terrestrial pools of carbon (C), helping to stabilize 
      the global climate system, yet are threatened by climate change (CC) and 
      associated air pollution (AP, highlighting ozone (O3) and nitrogen oxides (NOx)). 
      We adopt the perspective that CC-AP drivers and physiological impacts are 
      universal, resulting in consistent stress responses of forest ecosystems across 
      zonobiomes. Evidence supporting this viewpoint is presented from the literature 
      on ecosystem gross/net primary productivity and water cycling. Responses to CC-AP 
      are compared across evergreen/deciduous foliage types, discussing implications of 
      nutrition and resource turnover at tree and ecosystem scales. The availability of 
      data is extremely uneven across zonobiomes, yet unifying patterns of ecosystem 
      response are discernable. Ecosystem warming results in trade-offs between 
      respiration and biomass production, affecting high elevation forests more than in 
      the lowland tropics and low-elevation temperate zone. Resilience to drought is 
      modulated by tree size and species richness. Elevated O3 tends to counteract 
      stimulation by elevated carbon dioxide (CO2). Biotic stress and genomic structure 
      ultimately determine ecosystem responsiveness. Aggrading early- rather than 
      mature late-successional communities respond to CO2 enhancement, whereas O3 
      affects North American and Eurasian tree species consistently under free-air 
      fumigation. Insect herbivory is exacerbated by CC-AP in biome-specific ways. 
      Rhizosphere responses reflect similar stand-level nutritional dynamics across 
      zonobiomes, but are modulated by differences in tree-soil nutrient cycling 
      between deciduous and evergreen systems, and natural versus anthropogenic 
      nitrogen (N) oversupply. The hypothesis of consistency of forest responses to 
      interacting CC-AP is supported by currently available data, establishing the 
      precedent for a global network of long-term coordinated research sites across 
      zonobiomes to simultaneously advance both bottom-up (e.g., mechanistic) and 
      top-down (systems-level) understanding. This global, synthetic approach is needed 
      because high biological plasticity and physiographic variation across individual 
      ecosystems currently limit development of predictive models of forest responses 
      to CC-AP. Integrated research on C and nutrient cycling, O3-vegetation 
      interactions and water relations must target mechanisms' ecosystem 
      responsiveness. Worldwide case studies must be subject to biostatistical 
      exploration to elucidate overarching response patterns and synthesize the 
      resulting empirical data through advanced modelling, in order to provide 
      regionally coherent, yet globally integrated information in support of 
      internationally coordinated decision-making and policy development.

TI  - Relationship between fine-root exudation and respiration of two Quercus species 
      in a Japanese temperate forest.
PG  - 1011-1020
LID - 10.1093/treephys/tpx026 [doi]
AB  - Plants allocate a considerable amount of carbon (C) to fine roots as respiration 
      and exudation. Fine-root exudation could stimulate microbial activity, which 
      further contributes to soil heterotrophic respiration. Although both root 
      respiration and exudation are important components of belowground C cycling, how 
      they relate to each other is less well known. In this study, we aimed to explore 
      this relationship on mature trees growing in the field. The measurements were 
      performed on two canopy species, Quercus serrata Thunb. and Quercus glauca, in a 
      warm temperate forest. The respiration and exudation rates of the same fine-root 
      segment were measured in parallel with a syringe-basis incubation and a closed 
      static chamber, respectively. We also measured root traits and ectomycorrhizal 
      colonization ratio because these indexes commonly relate to root respiration and 
      reflect root physiology. The microbial activity enhanced by root exudation was 
      investigated by comparing the dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and microbial 
      biomass carbon (MBC) between rhizosphere soils and bulk soils. Mean DOC 
      concentration and MBC were ca two times higher in the rhizosphere soils and 
      positively related to exudation rates, indicating that exudation further relates 
      to the C dynamics in the soils. Flux rates of exudation and respiration were 
      positively correlated with each other. Both root exudation and respiration rates 
      positively related to ectomycorrhizal colonization and root tissue nitrogen, and 
      therefore the relationship between the two fluxes may be attributed to fine-root 
      activity. The flux rates of root respiration were 8.7 and 10.5 times as much as 
      those of exudation on a root-length basis and a root-weight basis, respectively. 
      In spite of the fact that flux rates of respiration and exudation varied 
      enormously among the fine-root segments of the two Quercus species, exudation was 
      in proportion to respiration. This result gives new insight into the fine-root 
      C-allocation strategy and the belowground C dynamics.

TI  - How interacting fungal species and mineral nitrogen inputs affect transfer of 
      nitrogen from litter via arbuscular mycorrhizal mycelium.
PG  - 9791-9801
LID - 10.1007/s11356-017-8649-6 [doi]
AB  - In the karst landscape, widespread in the world including southern China, soil 
      nutrient supply is strongly constrained. In such environments, arbuscular 
      mycorrhizal (AM) fungi may facilitate plant nutrient uptake. However, the 
      possible role of different AM fungal species, and their interactions, especially 
      in transferring nitrogen (N) from litter to plant, is poorly understood. We 
      conducted two microcosm experiments to investigate the role that two karst soil 
      AM fungi, Glomus etunicatum and Glomus mosseae, play in the transfer of N from 
      decomposing litter to the host plant and to determine how N availability 
      influences these processes. In experiment 1, Cinnamomum camphora tree seedlings 
      were grown in compartments inoculated with G. etunicatum. Lolium perenne leaf 
      litter labeled with delta(15)N was added to the soil in unplanted compartments. 
      Compartments containing the delta(15)N labeled litter were either accessible to 
      hyphae but not to seedling roots or were not accessible to hyphae or roots. The 
      addition of mineral N to one of the host compartments at the start of the 
      experiment significantly increased the biomass of the C. camphora seedlings, N 
      content and N:P ratio, AM mycelium length, and soil microbial biomass carbon and 
      N. However, significantly, more delta(15)N was acquired, from the leaf litter by the 
      AM hyphae and transferred to the host when mineral N was not added to the soil. 
      In experiment 2, in which C. camphora seedlings were inoculated with both G. 
      etunicatum and G. mosseae rather than with G. mosseae alone, there was a 
      significant increase in mycelial growth (50.21%), in soil microbial biomass 
      carbon (417.73%) in the rhizosphere, and in the amount of delta(15)N that was 
      transferred to the host. These findings suggest that maintaining AM fungal 
      diversity in karst soils could be important for mediating N transfer from organic 
      material to host plants in N-poor soils.

TI  - Response of rhizosphere soil microbial to Deyeuxia angustifolia encroaching in 
      two different vegetation communities in alpine tundra.
PG  - 43150

AB  - Deyeuxia angustifolia (Komarov) Y. L Chang is an herb species originating from 
      the birch forests in the Changbai Mountain. Recently, this species has been found 
      encroaching into large areas in the western slopes of the alpine tundra in the 
      Changbai Mountain, threatening the tundra ecosystem. In this study, we 
      systematically assessed the response of the rhizosphere soil microbial to D. 
      angustifolia encroaching in alpine tundra by conducting experiments for two 
      vegetation types (shrubs and herbs) by real-time PCR and Illumina Miseq 
      sequencing methods. The treatments consisted of D. angustifolia sites (DA), 
      native sites (NS, NH) and encroaching sites (ES, EH). Our results show that (1) 
      Rhizosphere soil properties of the alpine tundra were significantly impacted by 
      D. angustifolia encroaching; microbial nutrient cycling and soil bacterial 
      communities were shaped to be suitable for D. angustifolia growth; (2) The two 
      vegetation community rhizosphere soils responded differently to D. angustifolia 
      encroaching; (3) By encroaching into both vegetation communities, D. angustifolia 
      could effectively replace the native species by establishing positive plant-soil 
      feedback. The strong adaptation and assimilative capacity contributed to D. 
      angustifolia encroaching in the alpine tundra. Our research indicates that D. 
      angustifolia significantly impacts the rhizosphere soil microbial of the alpine 
      tundra.

TI  - [Simulated Desorption Kinetics of Lead by the Dominant Plant Roots Released Low 
      Molecular Weight Organic Acids from the Water-Level-Fluctuating Zone in the Three 
      Gorges Reservoir].
PG  - 600-607
LID - 10.13227/j.hjkx.201607167 [doi]
AB  - Vegetations grow vigorously in the water-level-fluctuating zone (WLFZ) of Three 
      Gorges Reservoir (TGR) during the non-flooded period. Low molecular weight 
      organic acids (LMWOAs) excreted from the roots of these plants may active the 
      heavy metals in soil. In order to investigate the desorption kinetics of Pb in 
      the vegetation covered soil of TGR, the LMWOAs released from Cynodon dactylon and 
      Echinochloa crusgalli roots, which are the dominant species in WLFZ, were 
      analyzed both qualitatively and quantitatively. Furthermore, single and mixed 
      species of LMWOAs were also used in the simulation. The results showed that the 
      variety and content of LMWOAs secreted from Cynodon dactylon roots were larger 
      and higher than those of Echinochloa crusgalli. Citric acid, malonic acid, acetic 
      acid and malic acid were the same LMWOAs released from the two types of plants. 
      The contents of acetic acid were the highest among all LMWOAs, which were 0.765 
      and 0.261 mmol.kg(-1) in Cynodon dactylon and Echinochloa crusgalli roots, 
      respectively.Citric acid, malonic acid and acetic acid were the same LMWOAs 
      detected from their rhizosphere soils. In the citric acid, malonic acid and 
      acetic acid desorption test, the desorption captivities of Pb were inhibited when 
      the concentration of LMWOAs was lower than 1 mmol.L(-1). The desorption ability 
      displayed a decreasing order of malonic acid > citric acid > acetic acid. 
      However, the three LMWOAs promoted the desorption of Pb in soil when their 
      concentrations were higher than 1 mmol.L(-1), respectively. The desorption 
      ability displayed a decreasing order of citric acid > malonic acid > acetic acid. 
      During the entire process of desorption, 0-240 min was the fast reaction stage, 
      and the remaining time was the slow reaction stage. The pseudo-second order 
      kinetics equation could fit best for the kinetic process.

TI  - Community Structures of Arbuscular Mycorrhizal Fungi in Soils and Plant Roots 
      Inhabiting Abandoned Mines of Korea.

AB  - In this study, we collected rhizosphere soils and root samples from a post-mining 
      area and a natural forest area in Jecheon, Korea. We extracted spores of 
      arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) from rhizospheres, and then examined the 
      sequences of 18S rDNA genes of the AMF from the collected roots of plants. We 
      compared the AMF communities in the post-mining area and the natural forest area 
      by sequence analysis of the AMF spores from soils and of the AMF clones from 
      roots. Consequently, we confirmed that the structure of AMF communities varied 
      between the post-mining area and the natural forest area and showed significant 
      relationship with heavy metal contents in soils. These results suggest that heavy 
      metal contamination by mining activity significantly affects the AMF community 
      structure.

TI  - Nutrient foraging strategies are associated with productivity and population 
      growth in forest shrubs.
PG  - 977-988
LID - 10.1093/aob/mcw271 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Temperate deciduous forest understoreys are experiencing 
      widespread changes in community composition, concurrent with increases in rates 
      of nitrogen supply. These shifts in plant abundance may be driven by 
      interspecific differences in nutrient foraging (i.e. conservative vs. acquisitive 
      strategies) and, thus, adaptation to contemporary nutrient loading conditions. 
      This study sought to determine if interspecific differences in nutrient foraging 
      could help explain patterns of shrub success and decline in eastern North 
      American forests. METHODS: Using plants grown in a common garden, fine root 
      traits associated with nutrient foraging were measured for six shrub species. 
      Traits included the mean and skewness of the root diameter distribution, specific 
      root length (SRL), C:N ratio, root tissue density, arbuscular mycorrhizal 
      colonization and foraging precision. Above- and below-ground productivity were 
      also determined for the same plants, and population growth rates were estimated 
      using data from a long-term study of community dynamics. Root traits were 
      compared among species and associations among root traits, measures of 
      productivity and rates of population growth were evaluated. KEY RESULTS: Species 
      fell into groups having thick or thin root forms, which correspond to 
      conservative vs. acquisitive nutrient foraging strategies. Interspecific 
      variation in root morphology and tissue construction correlated with measures of 
      productivity and rates of cover expansion. Of the four species with acquisitive 
      traits, three were introduced species that have become invasive in recent 
      decades, and the fourth was a weedy native. In contrast, the two species with 
      conservative traits were historically dominant shrubs that have declined in 
      abundance in eastern North American forests. CONCLUSIONS: In forest understoreys 
      of eastern North America, elevated nutrient availability may impose a filter on 
      species success in addition to above-ground processes such as herbivory and 
      overstorey canopy conditions. Shrubs that have root traits associated with rapid 
      uptake of soil nutrients may be more likely to increase in abundance, while 
      species without such traits may be less likely to keep pace with more productive 
      species.

AB  - The presented review discusses state-of-the-art mass spectrometric methods, which 
      have been developed and applied for investigation of chemical processes in the 
      soil-root interface, the so-called rhizosphere. Rhizosphere soil's physical and 
      chemical characteristics are to a great extent influenced by a complex mixture of 
      compounds released from plant roots, i.e. root exudates, which have a high impact 
      on nutrient and trace element dynamics in the soil-root interface as well as on 
      microbial activities or soil physico-chemical characteristics. Chemical 
      characterization as well as accurate quantification of the compounds present in 
      the rhizosphere is a major prerequisite for a better understanding of rhizosphere 
      processes and requires the development and application of advanced sampling 
      procedures in combination with highly selective and sensitive analytical 
      techniques. During the last years, targeted and non-targeted mass 
      spectrometry-based methods have emerged and their combination with specific 
      separation methods for various elements and compounds of a wide polarity range 
      have been successfully applied in several studies. With this review we critically 
      discuss the work that has been conducted within the last decade in the context of 
      rhizosphere research and elemental or molecular mass spectrometry emphasizing 
      different separation techniques as GC, LC and CE. Moreover, selected applications 
      such as metal detoxification or nutrient acquisition will be discussed regarding 
      the mass spectrometric techniques applied in studies of root exudates in 
      plant-bacteria interactions. Additionally, a more recent isotope probing 
      technique as novel mass spectrometry based application is highlighted.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Soil alkalinity shows significant constraints to crop productivity; 
      however, much less attention has been paid to analyze the effect of soil 
      alkalinity on plant growth and development. Shanrong No. 4 (SR4) is an alkalinity 
      tolerant bread wheat cultivar selected from an asymmetric somatic hybridization 
      between the bread wheat cultivar Jinan 177 (JN177) and tall wheatgrass 
      (Thinopyrum ponticum), which is a suitable material for studying alkalinity 
      tolerant associate genes. RESULTS: The growth of SR4 plant seedlings was less 
      inhibited than that of JN177 when exposed to alkalinity stress conditions. The 
      root cytosolic Na(+)/K(+) ratio in alkalinity stressed SR4 was lower than in 
      JN177, while alkalinity stressed SR4 contained higher level of nutrient elements 
      than in JN177. SR4 plant seedlings accumulated less malondialdehyde (MDA) and 
      reactive oxygen species (ROS), it also showed higher activity of ROS scavenging 
      enzymes than JN177 under alkalinity stress. The root intracellular pH decreased 
      in both alkalinity stressed JN177 and SR4, however, it was much lower in SR4 than 
      in JN177 under alkalinity stress. The transcriptomes of SR4 and JN177 seedlings 
      exposed to alkalinity stress were analyzed by digital gene expression tag 
      profiling method. Alkalinity stress conditions up- and down-regulated a large 
      number of genes in the seedling roots that play the functions in the categories 
      of transcription regulation, signal transduction and protein modification. 
      CONCLUSIONS: SR4 expresses a superior tolerance to alkaline stress conditions 
      which is due to its strong absorbing ability for nutrient ions, a strong 
      regulating ability for intracellular and rhizosphere pH and a more active ROS 
      scavenging ability.

TI  - Ericoid Roots and Mycospheres Govern Plant-Specific Bacterial Communities in 
      Boreal Forest Humus.
PG  - 939-953
LID - 10.1007/s00248-016-0922-6 [doi]
AB  - In this study, the bacterial populations of roots and mycospheres of the boreal 
      pine forest ericoid plants, heather (Calluna vulgaris), bilberry (Vaccinium 
      myrtillus), and lingonberry (Vaccinium vitis-idaea), were studied by qPCR and 
      next-generation sequencing (NGS). All bacterial communities of mycosphere soils 
      differed from soils uncolonized by mycorrhizal mycelia. Colonization by 
      mycorrhizal hyphae increased the total number of bacterial 16S ribosomal DNA 
      (rDNA) gene copies in the humus but decreased the number of different bacterial 
      operational taxonomic units (OTUs). Nevertheless, ericoid roots and mycospheres 
      supported numerous OTUs not present in uncolonized humus. Bacterial communities 
      in bilberry mycospheres were surprisingly similar to those in pine mycospheres 
      but not to bacterial communities in heather and lingonberry mycospheres. In 
      contrast, bacterial communities of ericoid roots were more similar to each other 
      than to those of pine roots. In all sample types, the relative abundances of 
      bacterial sequences belonging to Alphaproteobacteria and Acidobacteria were 
      higher than the sequences belonging to other classes. Soil samples contained more 
      Actinobacteria, Deltaproteobacteria, Opitutae, and Planctomycetia, whereas 
      Armatimonadia, Betaproteobacteria, Gammaproteobacteria, and Sphingobacteriia were 
      more common to roots. All mycosphere soils and roots harbored bacteria unique to 
      that particular habitat. Our study suggests that the habitation by ericoid plants 
      increases the overall bacterial diversity of boreal forest soils.

TI  - Assessment of bioavailable organic phosphorus in tropical forest soils by organic 
      acid extraction and phosphatase hydrolysis.
PG  - 93-102
AB  - Soil organic phosphorus contributes to the nutrition of tropical trees, but is 
      not accounted for in standard soil phosphorus tests. Plants and microbes can 
      release organic anions to solubilize organic phosphorus from soil surfaces, and 
      synthesize phosphatases to release inorganic phosphate from the solubilized 
      compounds. We developed a procedure to estimate bioavailable organic phosphorus 
      in tropical forest soils by simulating the secretion processes of organic acids 
      and phosphatases. Five lowland tropical forest soils with contrasting properties 
      (pH 4.4-6.1, total P 86-429 mg P kg(- 1)) were extracted with 2 mM citric acid 
      (i.e., 10 mumol g(- 1), approximating rhizosphere concentrations) adjusted to soil 
      pH in a 4:1 solution to soil ratio for 1 h. Three phosphatase enzymes were then 
      added to the soil extract to determine the forms of hydrolysable organic 
      phosphorus. Total phosphorus extracted by the procedure ranged between 3.22 and 
      8.06 mg P kg(- 1) (mean 5.55 +/- 0.42 mg P kg(- 1)), of which on average three 
      quarters was unreactive phosphorus (i.e., organic phosphorus plus inorganic 
      polyphosphate). Of the enzyme-hydrolysable unreactive phosphorus, 28% was simple 
      phosphomonoesters hydrolyzed by phosphomonoesterase from bovine intestinal 
      mucosa, a further 18% was phosphodiesters hydrolyzed by a combination of nuclease 
      from Penicillium citrinum and phosphomonoesterase, and the remaining 51% was 
      hydrolyzed by a broad-spectrum phytase from wheat. We conclude that soil organic 
      phosphorus can be solubilized and hydrolyzed by a combination of organic acids 
      and phosphatase enzymes in lowland tropical forest soils, indicating that this 
      pathway could make a significant contribution to biological phosphorus 
      acquisition in tropical forests. Furthermore, we have developed a method that can 
      be used to assess the bioavailability of this soil organic phosphorus.

TI  - Effects of prolonged drought stress on Scots pine seedling carbon allocation.
PG  - 418-427
LID - 10.1093/treephys/tpw119 [doi]
AB  - As the number of drought occurrences has been predicted to increase with 
      increasing temperatures, it is believed that boreal forests will become 
      particularly vulnerable to decreased growth and increased tree mortality caused 
      by the hydraulic failure, carbon starvation and vulnerability to pests following 
      these. Although drought-affected trees are known to have stunted growth, as well 
      as increased allocation of carbon to roots, still not enough is known about the 
      ways in which trees can acclimate to drought. We studied how drought stress 
      affects belowground and aboveground carbon dynamics, as well as nitrogen uptake, 
      in Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) seedlings exposed to prolonged drought. 
      Overall 40 Scots pine seedlings were divided into control and drought treatments 
      over two growing seasons. Seedlings were pulse-labelled with 13CO2 and litter 
      bags containing 15N-labelled root biomass, and these were used to follow nutrient 
      uptake of trees. We determined photosynthesis, biomass distribution, root and 
      rhizosphere respiration, water potential, leaf osmolalities and carbon and 
      nitrogen assimilation patterns in both treatments. The photosynthetic rate of the 
      drought-induced seedlings did not decrease compared to the control group, the 
      maximum leaf specific photosynthetic rate being 0.058 and 0.045 micromol g-1 s-1 for 
      the drought and control treatments, respectively. The effects of drought were, 
      however, observed as lower water potentials, increased osmolalities as well as 
      decreased growth and greater fine root-to-shoot ratio in the drought-treated 
      seedlings. We also observed improved uptake of labelled nitrogen from soil to 
      needles in the drought-treated seedlings. The results indicate acclimation of 
      seedlings to long-term drought by aiming to retain sufficient water uptake with 
      adequate allocation to roots and root-associated mycorrhizal fungi. The plants 
      seem to control water potential with osmolysis, for which sufficient 
      photosynthetic capability is needed.

AB  - Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons (PAHs) are ubiquitous and persistent soil 
      pollutants. Their fate and the influence of the plant rhizosphere on their 
      dynamics has been extensively studied, but studies mainly focused on their 
      dissipation rate. We conducted a plant-soil mesocosm experiment to study the fate 
      and distribution of PAHs or derived compounds in the extractable fraction, the 
      residual soil, the shoot biomass and the root biomass. The experiment was 
      conducted for 21 days using ryegrass and a forest soil spiked with (13)C-labeled 
      phenanthrene (PHE), using combined IRMS and NanoSIMS for analyses. Almost 90% of 
      the initial extractable PHE content was dissipated within 3 weeks, but no 
      rhizospheric effect was highlighted on PHE dissipation. More than 40% of 
      (13)C-PHE was still in the soil at the end of the experiment, but not as PHE or 
      PAH-derived compounds. Therefore it was under the form of new compounds 
      (metabolites) and/or had been incorporated into the microbial biomass. About 
      0.36% of the initial (13)C-PHE was recovered in the root and shoot tissues, 
      representing similar (13)C enrichment (E(13)C) as in the soil 
      (E(13)C  approximately  0.04 at.%). Using NanoSIMS, (13)C was also localized at the microscale 
      in the roots and their close environment. Global (13)C enrichment confirmed the 
      results obtained by IRMS. Some hotspots of (13)C enrichment were found, with a 
      high (32)S/(12)C(14)N ratio. Comparing the ratios, sizes and shapes of these 
      hotspots suggested that they could be bacteria.

TI  - Responses of Methanogenic and Methanotrophic Communities to Elevated Atmospheric 
      CO(2) and Temperature in a Paddy Field.
PG  - 1895
LID - 1895
AB  - Although climate change is predicted to affect methane (CH(4)) emissions in paddy 
      soil, the dynamics of methanogens and methanotrophs in paddy fields under climate 
      change have not yet been fully investigated. To address this issue, a multifactor 
      climate change experiment was conducted in a Chinese paddy field using the 
      following experimental treatments: (1) enrichment of atmospheric CO(2) 
      concentrations (500 ppm, CE), (2) canopy air warming (2 degrees C above the ambient, WA), 
      (3) combined CO(2) enrichment and warming (CW), and (4) ambient conditions (CK). 
      We analyzed the abundance of methanogens and methanotrophs, community structures, 
      CH(4) production and oxidation potentials, in situ CH(4) emissions using 
      real-time PCR, T-RFLP, and clone library techniques, as well as biochemical 
      assays. Compared to the control under CE and CW treatments, CH(4) production 
      potential, methanogenic gene abundance and soil microbial biomass carbon 
      significantly increased; the methanogenic community, however, remained stable. 
      The canopy air warming treatment only had an effect on CH(4) oxidation potential 
      at the ripening stage. Phylogenic analysis indicated that methanogens in the 
      rhizosphere were dominated by Methanosarcina, Methanocellales, 
      Methanobacteriales, and Methanomicrobiales, while methanotrophic sequences were 
      classified as Methylococcus, Methylocaldum, Methylomonas, Methylosarcina (Type I) 
      and Methylocystis (Type II). However, the relative abundance of Methylococcus 
      (Type I) decreased under CE and CW treatments and the relative abundance of 
      Methylocystis (Type II) increased. The in situ CH(4) fluxes indicated similar 
      seasonal patterns between treatments; both CE and CW increased CH(4) emissions. 
      In conclusion results suggest that methanogens and methanotrophs respond 
      differently to elevated atmospheric CO(2) concentrations and warming, thus adding 
      insights into the effects of simulated global climate change on CH(4) emissions 
      in paddy fields.

AB  - Gel-based, two-dimensional (2D) chemical imaging techniques are versatile methods 
      for investigating biogeochemically active environments at high spatial resolution 
      (sub-mm). State-of-the-art solute imaging techniques, such as diffusive gradients 
      in thin films (DGT) and planar optodes (PO), employ passive solute sampling or 
      sensing. Combining these methods will provide powerful tools for studying the 
      biogeochemistry of biological niches in soils and sediments. In this study we 
      aimed at developing a combined single-layer gel for direct pH imaging using PO 
      and sampling of anionic and cationic solutes by DGT, with subsequent analysis of 
      the bound solutes by laser ablation inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry 
      (LA-ICP-MS). We tested three ultra-thin (<100 mum) polyurethane-based gels, 
      incorporating anion and cation binding materials and the fluorescent pH indicator 
      DCIFODA (2',7'-dichloro-5(6)-N-octadecyl-carboxamidofluorescein). Results showed 
      that PO-based pH sensing using DCIFODA was impossible in the presence of the 
      anion binding materials due to interferences with DCIFODA protonation. One gel, 
      containing only a cation binding material and DCIFODA, was fully characterized 
      and showed similar performance characteristics as comparable DGT-only gels 
      (applicable pH range: pH 5-8, applicable ionic strength range: 1-20 mmol L(-1), 
      cation binding capacity  approximately 24 mug cm(-2)). The dynamic range for PO-based pH mapping 
      was between pH 5.5 and 7.5 with t(90) response time of  approximately 60 min. In a case study 
      we demonstrated the gel's suitability for multi-analyte solute imaging and mapped 
      pH gradients and concurrent metal solubility patterns in the rhizosphere of Salix 
      smithiana. pH decreases in the rooted soil were co-localized with elevated solute 
      fluxes of Al(3+), Co(2+), Cu(2+), Fe, Mn(2+), Ni(2+) and Pb(2+), indicating 
      pH-induced metal solubilisation.

AB  - The objective of this work was to test the PCB-degrading abilities of two 
      white-rot fungi, namely Pleurotus ostreatus and Irpex lacteus, in real 
      contaminated soils with different chemical properties and autochthonous 
      microflora. In addition to the efficiency in PCB removal, attention was given to 
      other important parameters, such as changes in the toxicity and formation of PCB 
      transformation products. Moreover, structural shifts and dynamics of both 
      bacterial and fungal communities were monitored using next-generation sequencing 
      and phospholipid fatty acid analysis. The best results were obtained with P. 
      ostreatus, which resulted in PCB removals of 18.5, 41.3 and 50.5% from the bulk, 
      top (surface) and rhizosphere, respectively, of dumpsite soils after 12 weeks of 
      treatment. Numerous transformation products were detected (hydoxylated and 
      methoxylated PCBs, chlorobenzoates and chlorobenzyl alcohols), which indicates 
      that both fungi were able to oxidize and decompose the aromatic moiety of PCBs in 
      the soils. Microbial community analysis revealed that P. ostreatus efficiently 
      colonized the soil samples and suppressed other fungal genera. However, the same 
      fungus substantially stimulated bacterial taxa that encompass putative PCB 
      degraders. The results of this study finally demonstrated the feasibility of 
      using this fungus for possible scaled-up bioremediation applications.

AB  - Globally, forests represent highly productive ecosystems that act as carbon sinks 
      where soil organic matter is formed from residuals after biomass decomposition as 
      well as from rhizodeposited carbon. Forests exhibit a high level of spatial 
      heterogeneity and the importance of trees, the dominant primary producers, for 
      their structure and functioning. Fungi, bacteria and archaea inhabit various 
      forest habitats: foliage, the wood of living trees, the bark surface, ground 
      vegetation, roots and the rhizosphere, litter, soil, deadwood, rock surfaces, 
      invertebrates, wetlands or the atmosphere, each of which has its own specific 
      features, such as nutrient availability or temporal dynamicy and specific drivers 
      that affect microbial abundance, the level of dominance of bacteria or fungi as 
      well as the composition of their communities. However, several microorganisms, 
      and in particular fungi, inhabit or even connect multiple habitats, and most 
      ecosystem processes affect multiple habitats. Forests are dynamic on a broad 
      temporal scale with processes ranging from short-term events over seasonal 
      ecosystem dynamics to long-term stand development after disturbances such as 
      fires or insect outbreaks. The understanding of these processes can be only 
      achieved by the exploration of the complex 'ecosystem microbiome' and its 
      functioning using focused, integrative microbiological and ecological research 
      performed across multiple habitats.

TI  - [Screening, identification and phosphate-solubilizing characteristics of

      tabuliformis in iron tailings yard.].
PG  - 3705-3711

AB  - Two strains of phosphate-solubilizing bacteria were isolated from the rhizosphere 
      of Pinus tabuliformis in iron tailings vegetation restoration areas in Malan 
      Town, Qianan City, Hebei Pro-vince. The bacterial strain D2 with strong 
      phosphate-solubilizing capacity was obtained via screening with plate and shake 
      flask. Based on the morphology, physiology and biochemistry, and the sequence 
      analysis of 16S rDNA, the D2 was identified as a member of Pantoea sp. A 
      fermentation experiment was conducted to investigate the effect of carbon and 
      nitrogen sources on the phosphate-solubilizing capacity of the strain D2; under 
      different nitrogen sources, the organic acids in liquid culture, as well as their 
      types and contents were determined by high performance liquid chromatography. The 
      results showed that the strain D2 was capable of efficiently solubilizing 
      tricalcium phosphate, and the highest value of available phosphorus was up to 
      392.13 mg.L(-1) in liquid culture. The strain D2 displayed the strongest 
      phosphate-solubilizing capability when glucose and ammonium sulfate were used as 
      carbon and nitrogen sources in the culture media, respectively. Under varied 
      nitrogen sources, the resulting organic acids and their types and contents were 
      different. When the nitrogen source in culture media was ammonium sulfate, 
      ammonium chloride, potassium nitrate, sodium nitrate or ammonium nitrate, all 
      four organic acids, including oxalic acid, formic acid, acetic acid and citric 
      acid, were produced. In addition, malic acid was uniquely produced when ammonium 
      sulfate, ammonium chloride or ammonium nitrate was used as the nitrogen source. 
      By Pearson's correlation analysis, a significant positive correlation between the 
      acetic acid content and the available phosphorus content was found (r=0.886, 
      P<0.05), suggesting that acetic acid produced by strain D2 played an important 
      role in promoting inorganic phosphorus dissolution, which was most likely to be 
      one of the important phosphate-solubilizing mechanisms of the strain.

AB  - P (phosphorus) and Fe (iron) are limiting elements and S (sulfur) is an important 
      element of the biogeochemical cycle in the mangrove environment. To assess the 
      effects of sulfur on the geochemical cycling of Fe and P at the sediment-plant 
      interface, the speciation distributions of Fe, P and S in sediments were 
      examined. The data showed that higher proportions of amorphous Fe, Fe-bound 
      phosphate, chromium reducible sulfur and elemental sulfur were found in the 
      rhizosphere, while more crystalline Fe, exchangeable phosphate and acid-volatile 
      sulfide were determined in the non-rhizosphere. Sulfate application induced an 
      increase in the Ex-P concentration, high P accumulation and high iron plaque 
      deposition in the roots. In conclusion, sulfate applications had a significant 
      influence on the geochemical cycling of Fe and P in the sediments. It 
      significantly curtailed the Fe and P limit to plant growth and enhanced plant 
      resistance to the rugged surroundings in mangrove.

AB  - The present study investigated the levels of As, Cd, Cr, Cu, Hg, Mn, Ni, Pb and 
      Zn in the seagrasses Posidonia oceanica and Cymodocea nodosa, and in the wetland 
      macrophytes Phragmites australis, Arundo donax, Typha domingensis, Apium 
      nodiflorum, and Nasturtium officinale. Results showed that the bioaccumulation 
      capacity from sediments, translocation, total levels in plant tissues, and 
      bioindication of metals in sediments, are generally species-specific. In 
      particular, the patterns of metals in the aquatic plants studied were overall 
      independent of ecology (coasts vs wetlands), biomass, anatomy (rhizomatous vs non 
      rhizomatous plants), and life form (hemicrytophytes vs hydrophytes). However, 
      marine phanerogams and wetland macrophytes shared some characteristics such as 
      high levels of heavy metals in their below-ground organs, similar capacity of 
      element translocation in the rhizosphere, compartmentalization of metals in the 
      different plant organs, and potential as bioindicators of Cu, Mn and Zn levels in 
      the substratum. In particular, the present findings indicate that, despite 
      ecological and morphological similarities, different plant species tend to 
      respond differently to exposure to heavy metals. Furthermore, this seems to 
      result from the species individual ability to accumulate and detoxify the various 
      metals rather than being attributed to differences in their ecological and 
      morpho-anatomical characteristics.

AB  - We investigated the diversity of ectomycorrhiza associated with the endemic Picea 
      crassifolia in Mount Helan National Nature Reserve in Inner Mongolia, China. 
      Toward this objective, we conducted morphological and molecular identification of 
      ectomycorrhizae in soil cubes taken from pure P. crassifolia stands. Eleven types 
      of ectomycorrhizal (ECM) organisms were separated, briefly described, and 
      identified. Nine morphotypes belonged to the phylum Basidiomycotina [Amphinema 
      byssoides, Cortinarius sp (cf. limonius), Cortinarius vernus, Inocybe cf. 
      nitidiscula, Inocybe sp 1, Sebacina incrustans, Sebacina sp, Suillus luteus, and 
      Piceirhiza tuberculata x Picea crassifolia (comb. Nov.)], and two morphotypes to 
      the phylum Ascomycotina (Cenococcum geophilum and Helvella sp). The diversity of 
      ECM organisms in P. crassifolia was lower than that reported by other studies on 
      spruce or pine forests, or on sporocarp diversity in the high-mountain forests of 
      China. Most of the fungi in the rhizosphere did not correspond to species 
      previously recorded as sporocarps above ground. Here, several new ectomycorrhiza 
      morphotypes are proposed and described. We also confirmed the ectomycorrhizal 
      status of the genus Sebacina (order Sebacinales).

AB  - A plant-assisted bioremediation strategy was applied in an area located in 
      Southern Italy, close to the city of Taranto, historically contaminated by 
      polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and heavy metals. A specific poplar clone 
      (Monviso) was selected for its ability to promote organic pollutant degradation 
      in the rhizosphere, as demonstrated elsewhere. Chemical and microbiological 
      analyses were performed at the time of poplar planting in selected plots at 
      different distances from the trunk (0.25-1m) and at different soil depths (0-20 
      and 20-40cm), at day 420. A significant decrease in PCB congeners and a reduction 
      in all heavy metals was observed where the poplar trees were present. No evidence 
      of PCB and heavy metal reduction was observed in the non poplar-vegetated soil. 
      Microbial analyses (dehydrogenase activity, cell viability, microbial abundance) 
      of the autochthonous microbial community showed an improvement in soil quality. 
      In particular, microbial activity generally increased in the poplar-rhizosphere 
      and a positive effect was observed in some cases at up to 1m distance from the 
      trunk and up to 40cm depth. The Monviso clone was effective in promoting both a 
      general decrease in contaminant occurrence and an increase in microbial activity 
      in the chronically polluted area a little more than one year after planting.

TI  - Ecosystem fluxes of hydrogen in a mid-latitude forest driven by soil 
      microorganisms and plants.
PG  - 906-919
LID - 10.1111/gcb.13463 [doi]
AB  - Molecular hydrogen (H(2) ) is an atmospheric trace gas with a large 
      microbe-mediated soil sink, yet cycling of this compound throughout ecosystems is 
      poorly understood. Measurements of the sources and sinks of H(2) in various 
      ecosystems are sparse, resulting in large uncertainties in the global H(2) 
      budget. Constraining the H(2) cycle is critical to understanding its role in 
      atmospheric chemistry and climate. We measured H(2) fluxes at high frequency in a 
      temperate mixed deciduous forest for 15 months using a tower-based flux-gradient 
      approach to determine both the soil-atmosphere and the net ecosystem flux of H(2) 
      . We found that Harvard Forest is a net H(2) sink (-1.4 +/- 1.1 kg H(2)  ha(-1) ) 
      with soils as the dominant H(2) sink (-2.0 +/- 1.0 kg H(2)  ha(-1) ) and 
      aboveground canopy emissions as the dominant H(2) source (+0.6 +/- 0.8 kg H(2) 
       ha(-1) ). Aboveground emissions of H(2) were an unexpected and substantial 
      component of the ecosystem H(2) flux, reducing net ecosystem uptake by 30% of 
      that calculated from soil uptake alone. Soil uptake was highly seasonal (July 
      maximum, February minimum), positively correlated with soil temperature and 
      negatively correlated with environmental variables relevant to diffusion into 
      soils (i.e., soil moisture, snow depth, snow density). Soil microbial H(2) uptake 
      was correlated with rhizosphere respiration rates (r = 0.8, P < 0.001), and H(2) 
      metabolism yielded up to 2% of the energy gleaned by microbes from carbon 
      substrate respiration. Here, we elucidate key processes controlling the 
      biosphere-atmosphere exchange of H(2) and raise new questions regarding the role 
      of aboveground biomass as a source of atmospheric H(2) and mechanisms linking 
      soil H(2) and carbon cycling. Results from this study should be incorporated into 
      modeling efforts to predict the response of the H(2) soil sink to changes in 
      anthropogenic H(2) emissions and shifting soil conditions with climate and 
      land-use change.

TI  - An overview of Australia's Phytophthora species assemblage in natural ecosystems 
      recovered from a survey in Victoria.
PG  - 47-58
LID - 10.5598/imafungus.2016.07.01.04 [doi]
AB  - Although Phytophthora species cause serious diseases worldwide, until recently 
      the main focus on disease in natural ecosystems in southern Australia has been on 
      the distribution and impact of P. cinnamomi. However, new Phytophthora pathogens 
      have emerged from natural ecosystems, and there is a need to better understand 
      the diversity and distribution of these species in our natural forests, woodlands 
      and heathlands. From a survey along a 70 km pipeline easement in Victoria, 
      Phytophthora species were isolated from 249 rhizosphere samples and 25 bait bags 
      deployed in 21 stream, river, or wetland locations. Of the 186 Phytophthora 
      isolates recovered, 130 were identified to species based on ITS sequence data. 
      Ninety-five isolates corresponded to 13 described Phytophthora species while 
      additionally 35 isolates were identified as Clade 6 hybrids. Phytophthora 
      cinnamomi was the most common species isolated (31 %), followed by P. elongata (6 
      %), both species were only recovered from soil. Samples from sites with the 
      highest soil moisture at the time of sampling had the highest yield of isolates. 
      Consistent with other studies throughout the world, Clade 6 species and their 
      hybrids dominated water samples, although many of these species were also 
      recovered less frequently from soil samples. Many of the species recovered in 
      this study have not previously been reported from eastern Australia, reinforcing 
      that Phytophthora species are widespread, abundant and diverse in natural 
      ecosystems. We have probably been underestimating Phytophthora diversity in 
      Australia.

TI  - Recovery of trees from drought depends on belowground sink control.
PG  - 16111
LID - 10.1038/nplants.2016.111 [doi]
AB  - Climate projections predict higher precipitation variability with more frequent 
      dry extremes(1). CO2 assimilation of forests decreases during drought, either by 
      stomatal closure(2) or by direct environmental control of sink tissue 
      activities(3). Ultimately, drought effects on forests depend on the ability of 
      forests to recover, but the mechanisms controlling ecosystem resilience are 
      uncertain(4). Here, we have investigated the effects of drought and drought 
      release on the carbon balances in beech trees by combining CO2 flux measurements, 
      metabolomics and (13)CO2 pulse labelling. During drought, net photosynthesis 
      (AN), soil respiration (RS) and the allocation of recent assimilates below ground 
      were reduced. Carbohydrates accumulated in metabolically resting roots but not in 
      leaves, indicating sink control of the tree carbon balance. After drought 
      release, RS recovered faster than AN and CO2 fluxes exceeded those in 
      continuously watered trees for months. This stimulation was related to greater 
      assimilate allocation to and metabolization in the rhizosphere. These findings 
      show that trees prioritize the investment of assimilates below ground, probably 
      to regain root functions after drought. We propose that root restoration plays a 
      key role in ecosystem resilience to drought, in that the increased sink activity 
      controls the recovery of carbon balances.

AB  - Three new species of Trischistoma and two new species of Tripylina 
      (Trischistomatidae) are described. Trischistoma ripariana n. sp. was collected in 
      the surface organic material and upper rhizosphere soil on a stream bank in 
      Oakville, California, USA. It is characterized by a short, thin body, the vulva 
      at 79-83%, a small index c (17-29) and a short tail, 34-57 microm. Trischistoma 
      corticulensis n. sp. was found in moss on tree bark in a tropical forest at the 
      La Mancha Ecological Institute, Veracruz State, Mexico. The vulva is at 67-73% 
      and the tail is elongate conoid (51-84 microm). Trischistoma helicoformis n. sp. was 
      collected on lichen growing on tree bark near the Carretera Interamericana in 
      Costa Rica. It is characterized by its spiral shape after fixation, the tail 
      length (76-101 microm), a very small index c (10-14.5) and very small sclerotised 
      pieces around the vagina. Tripylina rorkabanarum n. sp. was collected from moss 
      on tree bark in a tropical forest at the La Mancha Ecological Institute. It is 
      characterized by the presence of two cervical setae, the position of the 
      subventral teeth posterior to the dorsal tooth, the absence of sclerotized pieces 
      around the vagina and the distance of the dorsal tooth from the anterior, 10-15 
      mum. Tripylina iandrassyi n. sp. was collected from soil around a banana tree at 
      the La Mancha Ecological Institute. It is characterized by the presence of a 
      post-uterine sac, well-developed buccal lips, subventral teeth located posterior 
      to the dorsal tooth, one cervical seta in females and two in males, and by 
      spicules not completely surrounded by a muscular sheath.

TI  - Retention of phytosiderophores by the soil solid phase - adsorption and 
      desorption.
PG  - 85-97
AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Graminaceous plants exude phytosiderophores (PS) for 
      acquiring Fe. Adsorption of PS and its metal complexes to the soil solid phase 
      reduces the FePS solution concentration and hence Fe uptake. In this study we 
      aimed to quantify adsorption, and to determine to what extent adsorption depends 
      on the complexed metal and on soil properties. Furthermore, we examined if 
      adsorption is a reversible process. METHODS: Adsorption and desorption of PS and 
      metal-PS complexes were examined in batch experiments in which the PS 
      2'-deoxymugineic acid (DMA) and its metal-complexes (FeDMA, CuDMA, NiDMA and 
      ZnDMA) interacted with several calcareous soils. RESULTS: Adsorption of DMA 
      ligand (0-1000 muM) and metal-DMA complexes (0-100 muM) was linear in the 
      concentration range examined. Adsorption varied by a factor  approximately 2 depending on the 
      complexed metal and by up to a factor 3.5 depending on the soil. Under field-like 
      conditions (50 % water holding capacity), 50-84 % of the DMA was predicted to be 
      retained to the soil solid phase. Alike adsorption, desorption of metal-DMA 
      complexes is fast (approximate equilibrium within 1 hour). However, only a small 
      fraction of the adsorbed FeDMA (28-35 %) could be desorbed. CONCLUSIONS: Despite 
      this small fraction, the desorbed FeDMA still exceeded the amount in solution, 
      indicating that desorption of FeDMA from soil reactive compounds can be an 
      important process buffering the solution concentration.

TI  - A qPCR assay that specifically quantifies Tricholoma matsutake biomass in natural 
      soil.
PG  - 847-861
AB  - Tricholoma matsutake is an ectomycorrhizal basidiomycete that produces prized, 
      yet uncultivable, "matsutake" mushrooms along densely developed mycelia, called 
      "shiro," in the rhizosphere of coniferous forests. Pinus densiflora is a major 
      host of this fungus in Japan. Measuring T. matsutake biomass in soil allows us to 
      determine the kinetics of fungal growth before and after fruiting, which is 
      useful for analyzing the conditions of the shiro and its surrounding 
      mycorrhizosphere, predicting fruiting timing, and managing forests to obtain 
      better crop yields. Here, we document a novel method to quantify T. matsutake 
      mycelia in soil by quantifying a single-copy DNA element that is uniquely 
      conserved within T. matsutake but is absent from other fungal species, including 
      close relatives and a wide range of ectomycorrhizal associates of P. densiflora. 
      The targeted DNA region was amplified quantitatively in cultured mycelia that 
      were mixed with other fungal species and soil, as well as in an in vitro 
      co-culture system with P. densiflora seedlings. Using this method, we quantified 
      T. matsutake mycelia not only from shiro in natural environments but also from 
      the surrounding soil in which T. matsutake mycelia could not be observed by 
      visual examination or distinguished by other means. It was demonstrated that the 
      core of the shiro and its underlying area in the B horizon are predominantly 
      composed of fungal mycelia. The fungal mass in the A or A(0) horizon was much 
      lower, although many white mycelia were observed at the A horizon. Additionally, 
      the rhizospheric fungal biomass peaked during the fruiting season.

AB  - The impacts of plant species on the microbial communities and physico-chemical 
      characteristics of soil are well documented for many herbs, grasses and legumes 
      but much less so for tree species. Here, we investigate by rRNA and ITS amplicon 
      sequencing the diversity of microorganisms from the three domains of life 
      (Archaea, Bacteria and Eukaryota:Fungi) in soil samples taken from the forest 
      experimental site of Breuil-Chenue (France). We discovered significant 
      differences in the abundance, composition and structure of the microbial 
      communities associated with two phylogenetically distant tree species of the same 
      age, deciduous European beech (Fagus sylvatica) and coniferous Norway spruce 
      (Picea abies Karst), planted in the same soil. Our results suggest a significant 
      effect of tree species on soil microbiota though in different ways for each of 
      the three microbial groups. Fungal and archaeal community structures and 
      compositions are mainly determined according to tree species, whereas bacterial 
      communities differ to a great degree between rhizosphere and bulk soils, 
      regardless of the tree species. These results were confirmed by quantitative PCR, 
      which revealed significant enrichment of specific bacterial genera, such as 
      Burkholderia and Collimonas, known for their ability to weather minerals within 
      the tree root vicinity.

TI  - Characterization of Bacteria Isolation of Bacteria from Pinyon Rhizosphere,

AB  - Two hundred and fifty bacterial strains were isolated from pinyon rhizosphere and 
      screened for biosurfactants production. Among them, six bacterial strains were 
      selected for their potential to produce biosurfactants using two low cost wastes, 
      crude glycerol and lactoserum, as raw material. Both wastes were useful for 
      producing biosurfactants because of their high content in fat and carbohydrates. 
      The six strains were identified by 16S rDNA with an identity percentage higher 
      than 95%, three strains belonged to Enterobacter sp., Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 
      Bacillus pumilus and Rhizobium sp. All strains assayed were able to grow and 
      showed halos around the colonies as evidence of biosurfactants production on 
      Cetyl Trimethyl Ammonium Bromide agar with crude glycerol and lactoserum as 
      substrate. In a mineral salt liquid medium enriched with both wastes, the 
      biosurfactants were produced and collected from free cell medium after 72 h 
      incubation. The biosurfactants produced reduced the surface tension from 69 to 30 
      mN/m with an emulsification index of diesel at approximately 60%. The results 
      suggest that biosurfactants produced by rhizosphere bacteria from pinyon have 
      promising environmental applications.

TI  - Enhanced Nitrogen Availability in Karst Ecosystems by Oxalic Acid Release in the 
      Rhizosphere.
PG  - 687
LID - 10.3389/fpls.2016.00687 [doi]
LID - 687
AB  - In karst ecosystems, a high level of CaCO3 enhances the stabilization of soil 
      organic matter (SOM) and causes nitrogen (N) and/or phosphorus (P) limitation in 
      plants. Oxalic acid has been suggested to be involved in the nutrient-acquisition 
      strategy of plants because its addition can temporarily relieve nutrient 
      limitation. Therefore, understanding how oxalic acid drives N availability may 
      help support successful vegetation restoration in the karst ecosystems of 
      southwest China. We tested a model suggested by Clarholm et al. (2015) where 
      oxalate reacts with Ca bridges in SOM, thus exposing previously protected areas 
      to enzymatic attacks in a way that releases N for local uptake. We studied the 
      effects of oxalic acid, microbial biomass carbon (MBC), and 
      beta-1,4-N-acetylglucosaminidase (NAG) on potential N mineralization rates in 
      rhizosphere soils of four plant species (two shrubs and two trees) in karst 
      areas. The results showed that rhizosphere soils of shrubs grown on formerly 
      deforested land had significantly lower oxalic acid concentrations and NAG 
      activity than that of trees in a 200-year-old forest. The levels of MBC in 
      rhizosphere soils of shrubs were significantly lower than those of trees in the 
      growing season, but the measure of shrubs and trees were similar in the 
      non-growing season; the potential N mineralization rates showed a reverse 
      pattern. Positive relationships were found among oxalic acid, MBC, NAG activity, 
      and potential N mineralization rates for both shrubs and trees. This indicated 
      that oxalic acid, microbes, and NAG may enhance N availability for acquisition by 
      plants. Path analysis showed that oxalic acid enhanced potential N mineralization 
      rates indirectly through inducing microbes and NAG activities. We found that the 
      exudation of oxalic acid clearly provides an important mechanism that allows 
      plants to enhance nutrient acquisition in karst ecosystems.

TI  - Elevated CO(2) and temperature increase soil C losses from a soybean-maize 
      ecosystem.
PG  - 435-445
LID - 10.1111/gcb.13378 [doi]
AB  - Warming temperatures and increasing CO(2) are likely to have large effects on the 
      amount of carbon stored in soil, but predictions of these effects are poorly 
      constrained. We elevated temperature (canopy: +2.8  degrees C; soil growing season: 
      +1.8  degrees C; soil fallow: +2.3  degrees C) for 3 years within the 9th-11th years of an 
      elevated CO(2) (+200 ppm) experiment on a maize-soybean agroecosystem, measured 
      respiration by roots and soil microbes, and then used a process-based ecosystem 
      model (DayCent) to simulate the decadal effects of warming and CO(2) enrichment 
      on soil C. Both heating and elevated CO(2) increased respiration from soil 
      microbes by ~20%, but heating reduced respiration from roots and rhizosphere by 
      ~25%. The effects were additive, with no heat x CO(2) interactions. Particulate 
      organic matter and total soil C declined over time in all treatments and were 
      lower in elevated CO(2) plots than in ambient plots, but did not differ between 
      heat treatments. We speculate that these declines indicate a priming effect, with 
      increased C inputs under elevated CO(2) fueling a loss of old soil carbon. Model 
      simulations of heated plots agreed with our observations and predicted loss of 
      ~15% of soil organic C after 100 years of heating, but simulations of elevated 
      CO(2) failed to predict the observed C losses and instead predicted a ~4% gain in 
      soil organic C under any heating conditions. Despite model uncertainty, our 
      empirical results suggest that combined, elevated CO(2) and temperature will lead 
      to long-term declines in the amount of carbon stored in agricultural soils.

TI  - The effect of different land uses on arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi in the 
      northwestern Black Sea Region.
PG  - 350
LID - 10.1007/s10661-016-5350-z [doi]
AB  - The object of the present research was to establish correlations between the 
      status of root colonization of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) and different 
      types of land use. In order to achieve this aim, rhizosphere soil samples from 
      grassland crops were taken during June and July of 2013 in order to use for 
      determining several soil characteristics. The 27 different taxa and 60 soil 
      samples were collected from the rhizosphere level in the study areas. The 
      existence of AMF was confirmed in 100 % of these plants with different rations of 
      colonization (approximately 12-89 %). Bromus racemosus L. (pasture) was the most 
      dense taxon with the percentage of AMF colonization of 88.9 %, and Trifolium 
      pratense L. (forest) was the least dense taxon with the percentage of AMF 
      colonization of 12.2 % (average 52.0 %). As a result of the statistical analysis, 
      a positive relationship was found between the botanical composition of legumes 
      and AMF colonization (r = 0.35; p = 0.006). However, a negative relationship was 
      determined between botanical composition of other plant families and AMF 
      colonization (r = -0.39; p = 0.002). In addition, a positive relationship was 
      defined between soil pH (H2O) and the root colonization of AMF (r = 0.35; 
      p = 0.005). The pasture had the highest mean value of AMF root colonization. 
      However, the pasture and gap in the forest were in the same group, according to 
      the results of the S-N-K test.

TI  - Role of Plant Growth Promoting Rhizobacteria in Agricultural Sustainability-A 
      Review.
LID - 10.3390/molecules21050573 [doi]
LID - 573
AB  - Plant growth promoting rhizobacteria (PGPR) shows an important role in the 
      sustainable agriculture industry. The increasing demand for crop production with 
      a significant reduction of synthetic chemical fertilizers and pesticides use is a 
      big challenge nowadays. The use of PGPR has been proven to be an environmentally 
      sound way of increasing crop yields by facilitating plant growth through either a 
      direct or indirect mechanism. The mechanisms of PGPR include regulating hormonal 
      and nutritional balance, inducing resistance against plant pathogens, and 
      solubilizing nutrients for easy uptake by plants. In addition, PGPR show 
      synergistic and antagonistic interactions with microorganisms within the 
      rhizosphere and beyond in bulk soil, which indirectly boosts plant growth rate. 
      There are many bacteria species that act as PGPR, described in the literature as 
      successful for improving plant growth. However, there is a gap between the mode 
      of action (mechanism) of the PGPR for plant growth and the role of the PGPR as 
      biofertilizer-thus the importance of nano-encapsulation technology in improving 
      the efficacy of PGPR. Hence, this review bridges the gap mentioned and summarizes 
      the mechanism of PGPR as a biofertilizer for agricultural sustainability.

TI  - Impact of interspecific competition and drought on the allocation of new 
      assimilates in trees.
PG  - 785-96
LID - 10.1111/plb.12461 [doi]
AB  - In trees, the interplay between reduced carbon assimilation and the inability to 
      transport carbohydrates to the sites of demand under drought might be one of the 
      mechanisms leading to carbon starvation. However, we largely lack knowledge on 
      how drought effects on new assimilate allocation differ between species with 
      different drought sensitivities and how these effects are modified by 
      interspecific competition. We assessed the fate of (13) C labelled assimilates in 
      above- and belowground plant organs and in root/rhizosphere respired CO2 in 
      saplings of drought-tolerant Norway maple (Acer platanoides) and 
      drought-sensitive European beech (Fagus sylvatica) exposed to moderate drought, 
      either in mono- or mixed culture. While drought reduced stomatal conductance and 
      photosynthesis rates in both species, both maintained assimilate transport 
      belowground. Beech even allocated more new assimilate to the roots under moderate 
      drought compared to non-limited water supply conditions, and this pattern was 
      even more pronounced under interspecific competition. Even though maple was a 
      superior competitor compared to beech under non-limited soil water conditions, as 
      indicated by the changes in above- and belowground biomass of both species in the 
      interspecific competition treatments, we can state that beech was still able to 
      efficiently allocate new assimilate belowground under combined drought and 
      interspecific competition. This might be seen as a strategy to maintain root 
      osmotic potential and to prioritise root functioning. Our results thus show that 
      beech tolerates moderate drought stress plus competition without losing its 
      ability to supply belowground tissues. It remains to be explored in future work 
      if this strategy is also valid during long-term drought exposure.

TI  - Phosphorus resorption by young beech trees and soil phosphatase activity as 
      dependent on phosphorus availability.
PG  - 369-79
LID - 10.1007/s00442-016-3581-x [doi]
AB  - Motivated by decreasing foliar phosphorus (P) concentrations in Fagus sylvatica 
      L. forests, we studied P recycling depending on P fertilization in mesocosms with 
      juvenile trees and soils of two contrasting F. sylvatica L. forests in a 
      greenhouse. We hypothesized that forests with low soil P availability are better 
      adapted to recycle P than forests with high soil P availability. The P resorption 
      efficiency from senesced leaves was significantly higher at the P-poor site 
      (70 %) than at the P-rich site (48 %). P fertilization decreased the resorption 
      efficiency significantly at the P-poor site to 41 %, while it had no effect at 
      the P-rich site. Both acid and alkaline phosphatase activity were higher in the 
      rhizosphere of the P-poor than of the P-rich site by 53 and 27 %, respectively, 
      while the activities did not differ in the bulk soil. Fertilization decreased 
      acid phosphatase activity significantly at the P-poor site in the rhizosphere, 
      but had no effect on the alkaline, i.e., microbial, phosphatase activity at any 
      site. Acid phosphatase activity in the P-poor soil was highest in the 
      rhizosphere, while in the P-rich soil, it was highest in the bulk soil. We 
      conclude that F. sylvatica resorbed P more efficiently from senescent leaves at 
      low soil P availability than at high P availability and that acid phosphatase 
      activity in the rhizosphere but not in the bulk soil was increased at low P 
      availability. Moreover, we conclude that in the P-rich soil, microbial 
      phosphatases contributed more strongly to total phosphatase activity than plant 
      phosphatases.

TI  - Effects of cultivation ages and modes on microbial diversity in the rhizosphere 
      soil of Panax ginseng.
PG  - 28-37
LID - 10.1016/j.jgr.2015.04.004 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Panax ginseng cannot be cultivated on the same land consecutively for 
      an extended period, and the underlying mechanism regarding microorganisms is 
      still being explored. METHODS: Polymerase chain reaction and denaturing gradient 
      gel electrophoresis (PCR-DGGE) and BIOLOG methods were used to evaluate the 
      microbial genetic and functional diversity associated with the P. ginseng 
      rhizosphere soil in various cultivation ages and modes. RESULTS: The analysis of 
      microbial diversity using PCR-DGGE showed that microbial communities were 
      significantly variable in composition, of which six bacterial phyla and seven 
      fungal classes were detected in P. ginseng soil. Among them, Proteobacteria and 
      Hypocreales dominated. Fusarium oxysporum, a soilborne pathogen, was found in all 
      P. ginseng soil samples except R0. The results from functional diversity 
      suggested that the microbial metabolic diversity of fallow soil abandoned in 2003 
      was the maximum and transplanted soil was higher than direct-seeding soil and the 
      forest soil uncultivated P. ginseng, whereas the increase in cultivation ages in 
      the same mode led to decreases in microbial diversity in P. ginseng soil. 
      Carbohydrates, amino acids, and polymers were the main carbon sources utilized. 
      Furthermore, the microbial diversity index and multivariate comparisons indicated 
      that the augmentation of P. ginseng cultivation ages resulted in decreased 
      bacterial diversity and increased fungal diversity, whereas microbial diversity 
      was improved strikingly in transplanted soil and fallow soil abandoned for at 
      least one decade. CONCLUSION: The key factors for discontinuous P. ginseng 
      cultivation were the lack of balance in rhizosphere microbial communities and the 
      outbreak of soilborne diseases caused by the accumulation of its root exudates.

TI  - Carbon isotopic composition of forest soil respiration in the decade following 
      bark beetle and stem girdling disturbances in the Rocky Mountains.
PG  - 1513-23
LID - 10.1111/pce.12716 [doi]
AB  - Bark beetle outbreaks are widespread in western North American forests, reducing 
      primary productivity and transpiration, leading to forest mortality across large 
      areas and altering ecosystem carbon cycling. Here the carbon isotope composition 
      (delta(13) C) of soil respiration (deltaJ ) was monitored in the decade after disturbance 
      for forests affected naturally by mountain pine beetle infestation and 
      artificially by stem girdling. The seasonal mean deltaJ changed along both 
      chronosequences. We found (a) enrichment of deltaJ relative to controls (<1  per thousand) in 
      near-surface soils in the first 2 years after disturbance; (b) depletion (1 per thousand or 
      no change) during years 3-7; and (c) a second period of enrichment (1-2 per thousand) in 
      years 8-10. Results were consistent with isotopic patterns associated with the 
      gradual death and decomposition of rhizosphere organisms, fine roots, conifer 
      needles and woody roots and debris over the course of a decade after mortality. 
      Finally, deltaJ was progressively more (13) C-depleted deeper in the soil than near 
      the surface, while the bulk soil followed the well-established pattern of (13) 
      C-enrichment at depth. Overall, differences in deltaJ between mortality classes (<1 per thousand) 
      and soil depths (<3 per thousand) were smaller than variability within a class or depth over 
      a season (up to 6 per thousand).

AB  - Overlying water, sediment, rhizosphere sediment and mangrove seedlings in the 
      Futian mangrove forest were analyzed for heavy metals. The results showed that 
      mangrove plant acidified sediment and increased organic matter contents. Except 
      for chromium (Cr), nickel (Ni) and copper (Cu) in Aegiceras corniculatum 
      sediment, heavy metals in all sediments were higher than in overlying water, 
      rhizosphere sediment and mangrove root. Heavy metals in Avicennia marina 
      sediments were higher than other sediments. The lower heavy metal biological 
      concentration factors (BCFs) and translocation factors (TFs) indicated that 
      mangrove plant adopted exclusion strategy. The geo-accumulation index, potential 
      ecological risk index and risk assessment code (RAC) demonstrated that heavy 
      metals have posed a considerable ecological risk, especially for cadmium (Cd). 
      Heavy metals (Cr, Ni, Cu and Cd) mainly existed in the reducible fractions. These 
      findings provide actual heavy metal accumulations in sediment-plant ecosystems in 
      mangrove forest, being important in designing the long-term management and 
      conservation policies for managers of mangrove forest.

AB  - Root-triggered processes (growth, uptake and release of solutes) vary in space 
      and time, and interact with heterogeneous soil microenvironments that provide 
      habitats for (micro)biota on various scales. Despite tremendous progress in 
      method development in the past decades, finding a suitable experimental set-up to 
      investigate processes occurring at the dynamic conjunction of biosphere, 
      hydrosphere, and pedosphere in the close vicinity of active plant roots still 
      represents a major challenge. We discuss recent methodological developments in 
      rhizosphere research with a focus on imaging techniques. We further review 
      established concepts that have been updated with novel techniques, highlighting 
      the need for combinatorial approaches to disentangle rhizosphere processes on 
      relevant scales.

TI  - Characterizing root-associated fungal communities and soils of Douglas-fir 
      (Pseudotsuga menziesii) stands that naturally produce Oregon white truffles 
      (Tuber oregonense and Tuber gibbosum).
PG  - 367-76

AB  - Many truffle species in the genus Tuber are endemic to North America. Some of 
      these have commercial value such as Tuber oregonense and Tuber gibbosum, commonly 
      known as Oregon white truffles. Most of what is known about the ecology of these 
      truffles comes from observational data. These truffle species form 
      ectomycorrhizas with Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii) and sometimes fruit 
      abundantly in early successional forest regrowth. The goal of this study was to 
      characterize fungal communities and soils associated with truffle-producing 
      Douglas-fir sites. We extracted DNA from roots of five trees at four different 
      truffle-producing Douglas-fir sites (n = 20). We amplified the internal 
      transcribed spacer (ITS) region of the nuclear ribosomal DNA (nrDNA) and 
      sequenced amplicons with 454 pyrosequencing. After quality filtering, we 
      assembled 15,713 sequences into 150 fungal operational taxonomic units (OTUs). 
      Pezizomycetes (Tuber and Pyronemataceae) were the most abundant taxa detected 
      followed by Helotiales. Agaricomycetes represented most by Thelephoraceae, 
      Russulaceae, and Inocybaceae were also abundant. A total of five Tuber species 
      were detected. T. oregonense was the most abundant OTU, followed by T. gibbosum 
      and Wilcoxina mikolae. Fungal root endophytes were also detected and well 
      represented by Chalara and Phialocephala spp. Fungal community structure and soil 
      chemistry differed between sites. This study represents the first 
      characterization of the fungal communities in Douglas-fir stands producing Oregon 
      white truffles. We found that Tuber species can be dominant ectomycorrhizal 
      symbionts of Douglas-fir. Truffle fungi are also important in forest health, food 
      webs, and as a non-timber forest resource that can contribute to rural economies.

TI  - Growth and Nutrient Status of Kayu Kuku [ Pericopsis mooniana (Thw.) Thw] with 
      Mycorrhiza in Soil Media of Nickel Post Mining Site.
PG  - 158-170

AB  - BACKGROUND: Arbuscular Mycorrhizal Fungi are categorized as phytoremediant and 
      increase the tolerance of plants under condition of heavy metal pollution. 
      Effectiveness of AMF is determined very much by species of AMF, plant species and 
      environmental condition. Therefore, testing the effect of local AMF on growth and 
      absorption of nutrients and metal by Pericopsis mooniana planting stocks in 
      growing media which are heavily polluted by heavy metal, need to be conducted. 
      METHODOLOGY: There were testing of 6 inoculums of local AMF which were isolated 
      from rhizosphere of P. mooniana, namely AMF from district of Kolaka (Lamedai 
      Nature Reserve, Tanggetada Natural Forest, Bali Jaya Village Plantation Forest 
      and PT. Vale Indonesia Tbk) and from Kendari town (Campus environment of Halu 
      Oleo University and Office of Southeast Sulawesi Governor). Besides the 6 local 
      AMF, there were treatment without AMF (control) and treatment with mycofer as 
      comparison. RESULTS: Results showed that local AMF were effective in increasing 
      growth and biomass of plants; absorption of C, N, P and K in three parts of the 
      plants; Ca in stems and leaves and of Mg in leaf tissues; increasing formation of 
      plant's root nodules and were able to reduce Ni content in tissues of kayu kuku 
      planting stocks. Effects of local AMF from Lamedai nature reserve and AMF from 
      PT. Vale Indonesia were greater as compared with those of mycofer IPB. Content of 
      Ni in kayu kuku plant tissue was found more in roots as shown by the value of 
      TF<1. CONCLUSION: Based on this study, kayu kuku is categorized as excluder 
      species (TF<1) and moderate species toward Ni (>50 mg Ni/kg of plant dry weight) 
      and possessed very high dependence on AMF (MIE >75%). Local AMF are potential to 
      be developed as biological fertilizer to improve planting stocks for 
      rehabilitation of degraded land.

AB  - The Malaysian state of Sabah on the Island of Borneo is emerging as a hotspot for 
      nickel hyperaccumulator species with at least 25 such species discovered to date. 
      New discoveries of the hyperaccumulation trait in described taxa, as well as 
      taxonomical novelties that are nickel hyperaccumulators, continue to be made. 
      Here we describe a new nickel hyperaccumulating species of Actephila 
      (Phyllanthaceae) originating from two known populations on ultramafic soils in 
      Sabah. The most characteristic feature of Actephila alanbakeri are its knobbly 
      fruits, but other diagnostic morphological characters are discussed and 
      information about its ecology and rhizosphere and plant tissue chemistry is 
      provided. This new species is one of the strongest known nickel hyperaccumulator 
      plants in Southeast Asia with up to 14,700 mug g(-1) (1.47 %) nickel in its 
      leaves. The occurrences of Actephila alanbakeri on just two sites, both of which 
      lie outside protected areas and are disturbed by recurring forest fires, combined 
      with the small total numbers of individuals, render this species Endangered (EN) 
      on the basis of IUCN Red List Criteria.

      Flooded Indian Rice Field.
PG  - 519-23
LID - 10.1007/s00248-015-0699-z [doi]
AB  - Flooded rice fields are important sources of atmospheric methane. Aerobic 
      methanotrophs living in the vicinity of rice roots oxidize methane and act as 
      environmental filters. Here, we present genome characteristics of a 
      gammaproteobacterial methanotroph, isolate Sn10-6, which was isolated from a rice 
      rhizosphere of a flooded field in India. Sn10-6 has been identified as a member 
      of a putative novel genus and species within the family Methylococcaceae (Type I 
      methanotrophs). The draft genome of Sn10-6 showed pathways for the following: 
      methane oxidation, formaldehyde assimilation (RuMP), nitrogen fixation, 
      conversion of nitrite to nitrous oxide, and other interesting genes including the 
      ones responsible for survival in the rhizosphere environment. The majority of 
      genes found in this genome were most similar to Methylovulum miyakonese which is 
      a forest isolate. This draft genome provided insight into the physiology, 
      ecology, and phylogeny of this gammaproteobacterial methanotroph.

TI  - Short-term carbon cycling responses of a mature eucalypt woodland to gradual 
      stepwise enrichment of atmospheric CO2 concentration.
PG  - 380-90
LID - 10.1111/gcb.13109 [doi]
AB  - Projections of future climate are highly sensitive to uncertainties regarding 
      carbon (C) uptake and storage by terrestrial ecosystems. The Eucalyptus Free-Air 
      CO2 Enrichment (EucFACE) experiment was established to study the effects of 
      elevated atmospheric CO2 concentrations (eCO2 ) on a native mature eucalypt 
      woodland with low fertility soils in southeast Australia. In contrast to other 
      FACE experiments, the concentration of CO2 at EucFACE was increased gradually in 
      steps above ambient (+0, 30, 60, 90, 120, and 150 ppm CO2 above ambient of 
      ~400 ppm), with each step lasting approximately 5 weeks. This provided a unique 
      opportunity to study the short-term (weeks to months) response of C cycle flux 
      components to eCO2 across a range of CO2 concentrations in an intact ecosystem. 
      Soil CO2 efflux (i.e., soil respiration or Rsoil ) increased in response to 
      initial enrichment (e.g., +30 and +60 ppm CO2 ) but did not continue to increase 
      as the CO2 enrichment was stepped up to higher concentrations. Light-saturated 
      photosynthesis of canopy leaves (Asat ) also showed similar stimulation by 
      elevated CO2 at +60 ppm as at +150 ppm CO2 . The lack of significant effects of 
      eCO2 on soil moisture, microbial biomass, or activity suggests that the increase 
      in Rsoil likely reflected increased root and rhizosphere respiration rather than 
      increased microbial decomposition of soil organic matter. This rapid increase in 
      Rsoil suggests that under eCO2, additional photosynthate was produced, 
      transported belowground, and respired. The consequences of this increased 
      belowground activity and whether it is sustained through time in mature 
      ecosystems under eCO2 are a priority for future research.

AB  - Plant species richness (PSR) increases nutrient uptake which depletes 
      bioavailable nutrient pools in soil. No such relationship between plant uptake 
      and availability in soil was found for phosphorus (P). We explored PSR effects on 
      P mobilisation [phosphatase activity (PA)] in soil. PA increased with PSR. The 
      positive PSR effect was not solely due to an increase in Corg concentrations 
      because PSR remained significant if related to PA:Corg . An increase in PA per 
      unit Corg increases the probability of the temporal and spatial match between 
      substrate, enzyme and microorganism potentially serving as an adaption to 
      competition. Carbon use efficiency of microorganisms (Cmic :Corg ) increased with 
      increasing PSR while enzyme exudation efficiency (PA:Cmic ) remained constant. 
      These findings suggest the need for efficient C rather than P cycling underlying 
      the relationship between PSR and PA. Our results indicate that the coupling 
      between C and P cycling in soil becomes tighter with increasing PSR.

TI  - Diversity of Arbuscular Mycorrhizal Fungi in a Brazilian Atlantic Forest 
      Toposequence.
PG  - 164-77
LID - 10.1007/s00248-015-0661-0 [doi]
AB  - The diversity of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) was studied in the Atlantic 
      Forest in Serra do Mar Park (SE Brazil), based on seven host plants in 
      relationship to their soil environment, altitude and seasonality. The studied 
      plots along an elevation gradient are located at 80, 600, and 1,000 m. Soil 
      samples (0-20 cm) were collected in four seasons from SE Brazilian winter 2012 to 
      autumn 2013. AMF spores in rhizosperic soils were morphologically classified and 
      chemical, physical and microbiological soil caracteristics were determined. AMF 
      diversity in roots was evaluated using the NS31/AM1 primer pair, with subsequent 
      cloning and sequencing. In the rhizosphere, 58 AMF species were identified. The 
      genera Acaulospora and Glomus were predominant. However, in the roots, only 14 
      AMF sequencing groups were found and all had high similarity to Glomeraceae. AMF 
      species identities varied between altitudes and seasons. There were species that 
      contributed the most to this variation. Some soil characteristics (pH, organic 
      matter, microbial activity and microbial biomass carbon) showed a strong 
      relationship with the occurrence of certain species. The highest AMF species 
      diversity, based on Shannon's diversity index, was found for the highest 
      altitude. Seasonality did not affect the diversity. Our results show a high AMF 
      diversity, higher than commonly found in the Atlantic Forest. The AMF detected in 
      roots were not identical to those detected in rhizosperic soil and differences in 
      AMF communities were found in different altitudes even in geographically 
      close-lying sites.

TI  - Transcriptomic changes in the plant pathogenic fungus Rhizoctonia solani AG-3 in 
      response to the antagonistic bacteria Serratia proteamaculans and Serratia 
      plymuthica.
PG  - 630

AB  - BACKGROUND: Improved understanding of bacterial-fungal interactions in the 
      rhizosphere should assist in the successful application of bacteria as biological 
      control agents against fungal pathogens of plants, providing alternatives to 
      chemicals in sustainable agriculture. Rhizoctonia solani is an important 
      soil-associated fungal pathogen and its chemical treatment is not feasible or 
      economic. The genomes of the plant-associated bacteria Serratia proteamaculans S4 
      and Serratia plymuthica AS13 have been sequenced, revealing genetic traits that 
      may explain their diverse plant growth promoting activities and antagonistic 
      interactions with R. solani. To understand the functional response of this 
      pathogen to different bacteria and to elucidate whether the molecular mechanisms 
      that the fungus exploits involve general stress or more specific responses, we 
      performed a global transcriptome profiling of R. solani Rhs1AP anastomosis group 
      3 (AG-3) during interaction with the S4 and AS13 species of Serratia using 
      RNA-seq. RESULTS: Approximately 104,504 million clean 75-100 bp paired-end reads 
      were obtained from three libraries, each in triplicate (AG3-Control, AG3-S4 and 
      AG3-AS13). Transcriptome analysis revealed that approximately 10% of the fungal 
      transcriptome was differentially expressed during challenge with Serratia. The 
      numbers of S4- and AS13-specific differentially expressed genes (DEG) were 866 
      and 292 respectively, while there were 1035 common DEGs in the two treatment 
      groups. Four hundred and sixty and 242 genes respectively had values of log2 
      fold-change > 3 and for further analyses this cut-off value was used. Functional 
      classification of DEGs based on Gene Ontology enrichment analysis and on KEGG 
      pathway annotations revealed a general shift in fungal gene expression in which 
      genes related to xenobiotic degradation, toxin and antioxidant production, 
      energy, carbohydrate and lipid metabolism and hyphal rearrangements were 
      subjected to transcriptional regulation. CONCLUSIONS: This RNA-seq profiling 
      generated a novel dataset describing the functional response of the phytopathogen 
      R. solani AG3 to the plant-associated Serratia bacteria S4 and AS13. Most genes 
      were regulated in the same way in the presence of both bacterial isolates, but 
      there were also some strain-specific responses. The findings in this study will 
      be beneficial for further research on biological control and in depth exploration 
      of bacterial-fungal interactions in the rhizosphere.

TI  - The Phytophthora species assemblage and diversity in riparian alder ecosystems of 
      western Oregon, USA.

AB  - Phytophthora species were systematically sampled, isolated, identified and 
      compared for presence in streams, soil and roots of alder (Alnus species) 
      dominated riparian ecosystems in western Oregon. We describe the species 
      assemblage and evaluate Phytophthora diversity associated with alder. We 
      recovered 1250 isolates of 20 Phytophthora species. Only three species were 
      recovered from all substrates (streams, soil, alder roots): P. gonapodyides, the 
      informally described "P. taxon Pgchlamydo", and P. siskiyouensis. P. alni ssp. 
      uniformis along with five other species not previously recovered in Oregon 
      forests are included in the assemblage: P.citricola s.l., P. gregata, P. gallica, 
      P. nicotianae and P. parsiana. Phytophthora species diversity was greatest in 
      downstream riparian locations. There was no significant difference in species 
      diversity comparing soil and unwashed roots (the rhizosphere) to stream water. 
      There was a difference between the predominating species from the rhizosphere 
      compared to stream water. The most numerous species was the informally described 
      "P. taxon Oaksoil", which was mainly recovered from, and most predominant in, 
      stream water. The most common species from riparian forest soils and alder root 
      systems was P. gonapodyides.

AB  - The development and use of entomopathogens as classical, conservation and 
      augmentative biological control agents have included a number of successes and 
      some setbacks in the past 1years. In this forum paper we present current 
      information on development, use and future directions of insect-specific viruses, 
      bacteria, fungi and nematodes as components of integrated pest management 
      strategies for control of arthropod pests of crops, forests, urban habitats, and 
      insects of medical and veterinary importance. Insect pathogenic viruses are a 
      fruitful source of microbial control agents (MCAs), particularly for the control 
      of lepidopteran pests. Most research is focused on the baculoviruses, important 
      pathogens of some globally important pests for which control has become difficult 
      due to either pesticide resistance or pressure to reduce pesticide residues. 
      Baculoviruses are accepted as safe, readily mass produced, highly pathogenic and 
      easily formulated and applied control agents. New baculovirus products are 
      appearing in many countries and gaining an increased market share. However, the 
      absence of a practical in vitro mass production system, generally higher 
      production costs, limited post application persistence, slow rate of kill and 
      high host specificity currently contribute to restricted use in pest control. 
      Overcoming these limitations are key research areas for which progress could open 
      up use of insect viruses to much larger markets. A small number of 
      entomopathogenic bacteria have been commercially developed for control of insect 
      pests. These include several Bacillus thuringiensis sub-species, Lysinibacillus 
      (Bacillus) sphaericus, Paenibacillus spp. and Serratia entomophila. B. 
      thuringiensis sub-species kurstaki is the most widely used for control of pest 
      insects of crops and forests, and B. thuringiensis sub-species israelensis and L. 
      sphaericus are the primary pathogens used for control of medically important 
      pests including dipteran vectors. These pathogens combine the advantages of 
      chemical pesticides and MCAs: they are fast acting, easy to produce at a 
      relatively low cost, easy to formulate, have a long shelf life and allow delivery 
      using conventional application equipment and systemics (i.e. in transgenic 
      plants). Unlike broad spectrum chemical pesticides, B. thuringiensis toxins are 
      selective and negative environmental impact is very limited. Of the several 
      commercially produced MCAs, B. thuringiensis (Bt) has more than 50% of market 
      share. Extensive research, particularly on the molecular mode of action of Bt 
      toxins, has been conducted over the past two decades. The Bt genes used in 
      insect-resistant transgenic crops belong to the Cry and vegetative insecticidal 
      protein families of toxins. Bt has been highly efficacious in pest management of 
      corn and cotton, drastically reducing the amount of broad spectrum chemical 
      insecticides used while being safe for consumers and non-target organisms. 
      Despite successes, the adoption of Bt crops has not been without controversy. 
      Although there is a lack of scientific evidence regarding their detrimental 
      effects, this controversy has created the widespread perception in some quarters 
      that Bt crops are dangerous for the environment. In addition to discovery of more 
      efficacious isolates and toxins, an increase in the use of Bt products and 
      transgenes will rely on innovations in formulation, better delivery systems and 
      ultimately, wider public acceptance of transgenic plants expressing 
      insect-specific Bt toxins. Fungi are ubiquitous natural entomopathogens that 
      often cause epizootics in host insects and possess many desirable traits that 
      favor their development as MCAs. Presently, commercialized microbial pesticides 
      based on entomopathogenic fungi largely occupy niche markets. A variety of 
      molecular tools and technologies have recently allowed reclassification of 
      numerous species based on phylogeny, as well as matching anamorphs (asexual 
      forms) and teleomorphs (sexual forms) of several entomopathogenic taxa in the 
      Phylum Ascomycota. Although these fungi have been traditionally regarded 
      exclusively as pathogens of arthropods, recent studies have demonstrated that 
      they occupy a great diversity of ecological niches. Entomopathogenic fungi are 
      now known to be plant endophytes, plant disease antagonists, rhizosphere 
      colonizers, and plant growth promoters. These newly understood attributes provide 
      possibilities to use fungi in multiple roles. In addition to arthropod pest 
      control, some fungal species could simultaneously suppress plant pathogens and 
      plant parasitic nematodes as well as promote plant growth. A greater 
      understanding of fungal ecology is needed to define their roles in nature and 
      evaluate their limitations in biological control. More efficient mass production, 
      formulation and delivery systems must be devised to supply an ever increasing 
      market. More testing under field conditions is required to identify effects of 
      biotic and abiotic factors on efficacy and persistence. Lastly, greater attention 
      must be paid to their use within integrated pest management programs; in 
      particular, strategies that incorporate fungi in combination with arthropod 
      predators and parasitoids need to be defined to ensure compatibility and maximize 
      efficacy. Entomopathogenic nematodes (EPNs) in the genera Steinernema and 
      Heterorhabditis are potent MCAs. Substantial progress in research and application 
      of EPNs has been made in the past decade. The number of target pests shown to be 
      susceptible to EPNs has continued to increase. Advancements in this regard 
      primarily have been made in soil habitats where EPNs are shielded from 
      environmental extremes, but progress has also been made in use of nematodes in 
      above-ground habitats owing to the development of improved protective 
      formulations. Progress has also resulted from advancements in nematode production 
      technology using both in vivo and in vitro systems; novel application methods 
      such as distribution of infected host cadavers; and nematode strain improvement 
      via enhancement and stabilization of beneficial traits. Innovative research has 
      also yielded insights into the fundamentals of EPN biology including major 
      advances in genomics, nematode-bacterial symbiont interactions, ecological 
      relationships, and foraging behavior. Additional research is needed to leverage 
      these basic findings toward direct improvements in microbial control.

AB  - Here we show that verrucomicrobial community structure and abundance are 
      extremely sensitive to changes in chemical factors linked to soil fertility. 
      Terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism fingerprint and real-time 
      quantitative PCR assay were used to analyze changes in verrucomicrobial 
      communities associated with contrasting soil nutrient conditions in tropical 
      regions. In case study Model I ("Slash-and-burn deforestation") the 
      verrucomicrobial community structures revealed disparate patterns in 
      nutrient-enriched soils after slash-and-burn deforestation and natural 
      nutrient-poor soils under an adjacent primary forest in the Amazonia (R = 0.819, 
      P = 0.002). The relative proportion of Verrucomicrobia declined in response to 
      increased soil fertility after slash-and-burn deforestation, accounting on 
      average, for 4 and 2 % of the total bacterial signal, in natural nutrient-poor 
      forest soils and nutrient-enriched deforested soils, respectively. In case study 
      Model II ("Management practices for sugarcane") disparate patterns were revealed 
      in sugarcane rhizosphere sampled on optimal and deficient soil fertility for 
      sugarcane (R = 0.786, P = 0.002). Verrucomicrobial community abundance in 
      sugarcane rhizosphere was negatively correlated with soil fertility, accounting 
      for 2 and 5 % of the total bacterial signal, under optimal and deficient soil 
      fertility conditions for sugarcane, respectively. In nutrient-enriched soils, 
      verrucomicrobial community structures were related to soil factors linked to soil 
      fertility, such as total nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium and sum of bases, i.e., 
      the sum of calcium, magnesium and potassium contents. We conclude that community 
      structure and abundance represent important ecological aspects in soil 
      verrucomicrobial communities for tracking the changes in chemical factors linked 
      to soil fertility under tropical environmental conditions.

TI  - O(2) dynamics in the rhizosphere of young rice plants (Oryza sativa L.) as 
      studied by planar optodes.
PG  - 279-292
LID - 10.1007/s11104-015-2382-z [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Radial O(2) loss (ROL) strongly affect the O(2) availability 
      in the rhizosphere of rice. The ROL create an oxic zone around the roots, 
      protecting the plant from toxic reduced chemical species and regulates the redox 
      chemistry in the soil. This study investigates the spatio-temporal variability in 
      O(2) dynamics in the rice rhizosphere. METHOD: Applying high-resolution planar 
      optode imaging, we investigated the O(2) dynamics of plants grown in 
      water saturated soil, as a function of ambient O(2) level, irradiance and plant 
      development, for submerged and emerged plants. RESULTS: O(2) leakage was 
      heterogeneously distributed with zones of intense leakage around roots tips and 
      young developing roots. While the majority of roots exhibited high ROL others 
      remained surrounded by anoxic soil. ROL was affected by ambient O(2) levels 
      around the plant, as well as irradiance, indicating a direct influence of 
      photosynthetic activity on ROL. At onset of darkness, oxia in the rhizosphere was 
      drastically reduced, but subsequently oxia gradually increased, presumably as 
      root and/or soil respiration declined. CONCLUSION: The study demonstrates a high 
      spatio-temporal heterogeneity in rhizosphere O(2) dynamics and difference in ROL 
      between different parts of the rhizosphere. The work documents that 
      spatio-temporal measurements are important to fully understand and account for 
      the highly variable O(2) dynamics and associated biogeochemical processes and 
      pathways in the rice rhizosphere.

AB  - This study was aimed at complex characterization of three soil samples (bulk 
      soil, topsoil and rhizosphere soil) from a site historically contaminated with 
      polychlorinated biphenyls (PCB). The bulk soil was the most highly contaminated, 
      with a PCB concentration of 705.95 mg kg(-1), while the rhizosphere soil was the 
      least contaminated (169.36 mg kg(-1)). PCB degradation intermediates, namely 
      chlorobenzoic acids (CBAs), were detected in all the soil samples, suggesting the 
      occurrence of microbial transformation processes over time. The higher content of 
      organic carbon in the topsoil and rhizosphere soil than in the bulk soil could be 
      linked to the reduced bioaccessibility (bioavailability) of these chlorinated 
      pollutants. However, different proportions of the PCB congener contents and 
      different bioaccessibility of the PCB homologues indicate microbial 
      biotransformation of the compounds. The higher content of organic carbon probably 
      also promoted the growth of microorganisms, as revealed by phospholipid fatty 
      acid (PFLA) quantification. Tag-encoded pyrosequencing analysis showed that the 
      bacterial community structure was significantly similar among the three soils and 
      was predominated by Proteobacteria (44-48%) in all cases. Moreover, analysis at 
      lower taxonomic levels pointed to the presence of genera (Sphingomonas, 
      Bulkholderia, Arthrobacter, Bacillus) including members with reported PCB removal 
      abilities. The fungal community was mostly represented by Basidiomycota and 
      Ascomycota, which accounted for >80% of all the sequences detected in the three 
      soils. Fungal taxa with biodegradation potential (Paxillus, Cryptococcus, Phoma, 
      Mortierella) were also found. These results highlight the potential of the 
      indigenous consortia present at the site as a starting point for PCB 
      bioremediation processes.

AB  - Soil microbes are active players in energy flow and material exchange of the 
      forest ecosystems, but the research on the relationship between the microbial 
      diversity and the vegetation types is less conducted, especially in the 
      subtropical area of China. In this present study, the rhizosphere soils of 
      evergreen broad-leaf forest (EBF), coniferous forest (CF), subalpine dwarf forest 
      (SDF) and alpine meadow (AM) were chosen as test sites. Terminal-restriction 
      fragment length polymorphisms (T-RFLP) analysis was used to detect the 
      composition and diversity of soil bacterial communities under different 
      vegetation types in the National Natural Reserve of Wuyi Mountains. Our results 
      revealed distinct differences in soil microbial composition under different 
      vegetation types. Total 73 microbes were identified in soil samples of the four 
      vegetation types, and 56, 49, 46 and 36 clones were obtained from the soils of 
      EBF, CF, SDF and AM, respectively, and subsequently sequenced. The 
      Actinobacteria, Fusobacterium, Bacteroidetes and Proteobacteria were the most 
      predominant in all soil samples. The order of Shannon-Wiener index (H) of all 
      soil samples was in the order of EBF>CF>SDF>AM, whereas bacterial species 
      richness as estimated by four restriction enzymes indicated no significant 
      difference. Principal component analysis (PCA) revealed that the soil bacterial 
      communities' structures of EBF, CF, SDF and AM were clearly separated along the 
      first and second principal components, which explained 62.17% and 31.58% of the 
      total variance, respectively. The soil physical-chemical properties such as total 
      organic carbon (TOC), total nitrogen (TN), total phosphorus (TP) and total 
      potassium (TK) were positively correlated with the diversity of bacterial 
      communities.

TI  - Ectomycorrhizal Communities on the Roots of Two Beech (Fagus sylvatica) 
      Populations from Contrasting Climates Differ in Nitrogen Acquisition in a Common 
      Environment.
PG  - 5957-67
LID - 10.1128/AEM.01481-15 [doi]
AB  - Beech (Fagus sylvatica), a dominant forest species in Central Europe, competes 
      for nitrogen with soil microbes and suffers from N limitation under dry 
      conditions. We hypothesized that ectomycorrhizal communities and the free-living 
      rhizosphere microbes from beech trees from sites with two contrasting climatic 
      conditions exhibit differences in N acquisition that contribute to differences in 
      host N uptake and are related to differences in host belowground carbon 
      allocation. To test these hypotheses, young trees from the natural regeneration 
      of two genetically similar populations, one from dryer conditions (located in an 
      area with a southwest exposure [SW trees]) and the other from a cooler, moist 
      climate (located in an area with a northeast exposure [NE trees]), were 
      transplanted into a homogeneous substrate in the same environment and labeled 
      with (13)CO2 and (15)NH4 (+). Free-living rhizosphere microbes were characterized 
      by marker genes for the N cycle, but no differences between the rhizospheres of 
      SW or NE trees were found. Lower (15)N enrichment was found in the 
      ectomycorrhizal communities of the NE tree communities than the SW tree 
      communities, whereas no significant differences in (15)N enrichment were observed 
      for nonmycorrhizal root tips of SW and NE trees. Neither the ectomycorrhizal 
      communities nor the nonmycorrhizal root tips originating from NE and SW trees 
      showed differences in (13)C signatures. Because the level of (15)N accumulation 
      in fine roots and the amount transferred to leaves were lower in NE trees than SW 
      trees, our data support the suggestion that the ectomycorrhizal community 
      influences N transfer to its host and demonstrate that the fungal community from 
      the dry condition was more efficient in N acquisition when environmental 
      constraints were relieved. These findings highlight the importance of adapted 
      ectomycorrhizal communities for forest nutrition in a changing climate.

TI  - CAN Canopy Addition of Nitrogen Better Illustrate the Effect of Atmospheric 
      Nitrogen Deposition on Forest Ecosystem?
PG  - 11245
LID - 10.1038/srep11245 [doi]
LID - 11245
AB  - Increasing atmospheric nitrogen (N) deposition could profoundly impact community 
      structure and ecosystem functions in forests. However, conventional experiments 
      with understory addition of N (UAN) largely neglect canopy-associated biota and 
      processes and therefore may not realistically simulate atmospheric N deposition 
      to generate reliable impacts on forest ecosystems. Here we, for the first time, 
      designed a novel experiment with canopy addition of N (CAN) vs. UAN and reviewed 
      the merits and pitfalls of the two approaches. The following hypotheses will be 
      tested: i) UAN overestimates the N addition effects on understory and soil 
      processes but underestimates those on canopy-associated biota and processes, ii) 
      with low-level N addition, CAN favors canopy tree species and canopy-dwelling 
      biota and promotes the detritus food web, and iii) with high-level N addition, 
      CAN suppresses canopy tree species and other biota and favors rhizosphere food 
      web. As a long-term comprehensive program, this experiment will provide 
      opportunities for multidisciplinary collaborations, including biogeochemistry, 
      microbiology, zoology, and plant science to examine forest ecosystem responses to 
      atmospheric N deposition.

AB  - To assess the responses of the soil microbial community to chronic ozone (O3), 
      wheat seedlings (Triticum aestivum Linn.) were planted in the field and exposed 
      to elevated O3 (eO3) concentration. Three treatments were employed: (1) Control 
      treatment (CK), AOT40=0; (2) O3-1, AOT40=1.59 ppm*h; (3) O3-2, AOT40=9.17 ppm*h. 
      Soil samples were collected for the assessment of microbial biomass C, 
      community-level physiological profiles (CLPPs), and phospholipid fatty acids 
      (PLFAs). EO3 concentration significantly reduced soil microbial carbon and 
      changed microbial CLPPs in rhizosphere soil, but not in non-rhizosphere soil. The 
      results of the PLFAs showed that eO3 concentrations had significant effects on 
      soil community structure in both rhizosphere and non-rhizosphere soils. The 
      relative abundances of fungal and actinomycetous indicator PLFAs decreased in 
      both rhizosphere and non-rhizosphere soils, while those of bacterial PLFAs 
      increased. Thus the results proved that eO3 concentration significantly changed 
      the soil microbial community function and composition, which would influence the 
      soil nutrient supply and carbon dynamics under O3 exposure.

AB  - Strains Y-12(T) and Y-47(T) were isolated from mountain forest soil and strain 
      WR43(T) was isolated from rhizosphere soil, at Daejeon, Korea. The three strains 
      grew at 10-55  degrees C (optimal growth at 28-30  degrees C), at pH 3.0-8.0 (optimal growth at 
      pH 6.0) and in the presence of 0-4.0% (w/v) NaCl, growing optimally in the 
      absence of added NaCl. On the basis of 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis, the three 
      strains were found to belong to the genus Burkholderia, showing the closest 
      phylogenetic similarity to Burkholderia diazotrophica JPY461(T) (97.2-97.7%); the 
      similarity between the three sequences ranged from 98.3 to 98.7%. Additionally, 
      the three strains formed a distinct group in phylogenetic trees based on the 
      housekeeping genes recA and gyrB. The predominant ubiquinone was Q-8, the major 
      fatty acids were C16 : 0 and C17  : 0 cyclo and the DNA G+C content of the novel 
      isolates was 61.6-64.4 mol%. DNA-DNA relatedness among the three strains and the 
      type strains of the closest species of the genus Burkholderia was less than 50%. 
      On the basis of 16S rRNA, recA and gyrB gene sequence similarities, 
      chemotaxonomic and phenotypic data, the three strains represent three novel 
      species within the genus Burkholderia, for which the names Burkholderia 
      humisilvae sp. nov. (type strain Y-12(T)= KACC 17601(T) = NBRC 109933(T) = NCAIM 
      B 02543(T)), Burkholderia solisilvae sp. nov. (type strain Y-47(T) = KACC 
      17602(T)= NBRC 109934(T) = NCAIM B 02539(T)) and Burkholderia rhizosphaerae sp. 
      nov. (type strain WR43(T) = KACC 17603(T) = NBRC 109935(T) = NCAIM B 02541(T)) 
      are proposed.

TI  - Bacterial N2-fixation in mangrove ecosystems: insights from a diazotroph-mangrove 
      interaction.
PG  - 445

AB  - Mangrove forests are highly productive ecosystems but represent low nutrient 
      environments. Nitrogen availability is one of the main factors limiting mangrove 
      growth. Diazotrophs have been identified as key organisms that provide nitrogen 
      to these environments. N2-fixation by such organisms was found to be higher in 
      the mangrove roots than in surrounding rhizosphere. Moreover, previous studies 
      showed that mangroves grew better in the presence of N2-fixers indicating a 
      potentially mutualistic relationship. However, the molecular signals and 
      mechanisms that govern these interactions are still poorly understood. Here we 
      present novel insights in the interaction of a diazotroph with a mangrove species 
      to improve our understanding of the molecular and ecophysiological relationship 
      between these two organisms under controlled conditions. Our results showed that 
      Marinobacterium mangrovicola is a versatile organism capable of competing with 
      other organisms to survive for long periods in mangrove soils. N2-fixation by 
      this bacterium was up-regulated in the presence of mangrove roots, indicating a 
      possible beneficial interaction. The increase in N2-fixation was limited to cells 
      of the exponential growth phase suggesting that N2-fixation differs over the 
      bacterial growth cycle. Bacterial transformants harboring a transcriptional 
      nifH::gusA fusion showed that M. mangrovicola successfully colonized mangrove 
      roots and simultaneously conducted N2-fixation. The colonization process was 
      stimulated by the lack of an external carbon source suggesting a possible 
      mutualistic relationship. M. mangrovicola represents an interesting genetically 
      accessible diazotroph, which colonize mangrove roots and exhibit higher 
      N2-fixation in the presence of mangrove roots. Consequently, we propose this 
      microorganism as a tool to study molecular interactions between N2-fixers and 
      mangrove plants and to better understand how changes in the environment could 
      impact these important and relatively unknown interactions.

AB  - Strain NHI-8(T) was isolated from a forest soil sample, collected in South Korea, 
      by using a modified culture method. Comparative analysis of its nearly 
      full-length 16S rRNA gene sequence showed that strain NHI-8(T) belongs to the 
      genus Mesorhizobium and to be closely related to Mesorhizobium chacoense PR5(T) 
      (97.32 %). The levels of DNA-DNA relatedness between strain NHI-8(T) and 
      reference type strains of the genus Mesorhizobium were 32.28-53.65 %. SDS-PAGE of 
      total soluble proteins and the sequences of the housekeeping genes recA, glnII, 
      and atpD were also used to support the clade grouping in rhizobia. The new strain 
      contained summed feature 8 (57.0 %), cyclo-C19:0omega8c (17.3 %), and C18:0 (11.0 %) 
      as the major fatty acids, as in genus Mesorhizobium. The strain contained 
      cardiolipin, phosphatidylglycerol, ornithine-containing lipid, 
      phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidyl-N-dimethylethanolamine, and 
      phosphatidylcholine. Morphological and physiological analyses were performed to 
      compare the characteristics of our strain with those of the reference type 
      strains. Based on the results, strain NHI-8(T) was determined to represent a 
      novel member of the genus Mesorhizobium, and the name Mesorhizobium soli is 
      proposed. The type strain is NHI-8(T) (=KEMB 9005-153(T) = KACC 17916(T) = JCM 
      19897(T)).

TI  - Localized metal solubilization in the rhizosphere of Salix smithiana upon sulfur 
      application.
PG  - 4522-9
LID - 10.1021/es505758j [doi]
AB  - A metal-accumulating willow was grown under greenhouse conditions on a 
      Zn/Cd-polluted soil to investigate the effects of sulfur (S(0)) application on 
      metal solubility and plant uptake. Soil porewater samples were analyzed 8 times 
      during 61 days of growth, while DGT-measured metal flux and O2 were chemically 
      mapped at selected times. Sulfur oxidation resulted in soil acidification and 
      related mobilization of Mn, Zn, and Cd, more pronounced in the rooted compared to 
      bulk soil. Chemical imaging revealed increased DGT-measured Zn and Cd flux at the 
      root-soil interface. Our findings indicated sustained microbial S(0) oxidation 
      and associated metal mobilization close to root surfaces. The localized depletion 
      of O2 along single roots upon S(0) addition indicated the contribution of 
      reductive Mn (oxy)hydoxide dissolution with Mn eventually becoming a terminal 
      electron acceptor after depletion of O2 and NO3(-). The S(0) treatments increased 
      the foliar metal concentrations (mg kg(-1) dwt) up to 10-fold for Mn, (5810 +/- 
      593), 3.3-fold for Zn (3850 +/- 87.0), and 1.7-fold for Cd (36.9 +/- 3.35), but had 
      no significant influence on biomass production. Lower metal solubilization in the 
      bulk soils should translate into reduced leaching, offering opportunities for 
      using S(0) as environmentally favorable amendment for phytoextraction of 
      metal-polluted soils.

TI  - Metagenomic assessment of the potential microbial nitrogen pathways in the 
      rhizosphere of a mediterranean forest after a wildfire.

AB  - Wildfires are frequent in the forests of the Mediterranean Basin and have greatly 
      influenced this ecosystem. Changes to the physical and chemical properties of the 
      soil, due to fire and post-fire conditions, result in alterations of both the 
      bacterial communities and the nitrogen cycle. We explored the effects of a holm 
      oak forest wildfire on the rhizospheric bacterial communities involved in the 
      nitrogen cycle. Metagenomic data of the genes involved in the nitrogen cycle 
      showed that both the undisturbed and burned rhizospheres had a conservative 
      nitrogen cycle with a larger number of sequences related to the nitrogen 
      incorporation pathways and a lower number for nitrogen output. However, the 
      burned rhizosphere showed a statistically significant increase in the number of 
      sequences for nitrogen incorporation (allantoin utilization and nitrogen 
      fixation) and a significantly lower number of sequences for denitrification and 
      dissimilatory nitrite reductase subsystems, possibly in order to compensate for 
      nitrogen loss from the soil after burning. The genetic potential for nitrogen 
      incorporation into the ecosystem was assessed through the diversity of the 
      nitrogenase reductase enzyme, which is encoded by the nifH gene. We found that 
      nifH gene diversity and richness were lower in burned than in undisturbed 
      rhizospheric soils. The structure of the bacterial communities involved in the 
      nitrogen cycle showed a statistically significant increase of Actinobacteria and 
      Firmicutes phyla after the wildfire. Both approaches showed the important role of 
      gram-positive bacteria in the ecosystem after a wildfire.

AB  - Fungi are important soil components as both decomposers and plant symbionts and 
      play a major role in ecological and biogeochemical processes. However, little is 
      known about the richness and structure of fungal communities. DNA sequencing 
      technologies allow for the direct estimation of microbial community diversity, 
      avoiding culture-based biases. We therefore used 454 pyrosequencing to 
      investigate the fungal communities in the rhizosphere of Xinjiang jujube. We 
      obtained no less than 40,488 internal transcribed spacer (ITS) rDNA reads, the 
      number of each sample was 6943, 6647, 6584, 6550, 6860, and 6904, and we used 
      bioinformatics and multivariate statistics to analyze the results. The index of 
      diversity showed greater richness in the rhizosphere fungal community of a 
      3-year-old jujube than in that of an 8-year-old jujube. Most operational 
      taxonomic units belonged to Ascomycota, and taxonomic analyses identified 
      Hypocreales as the dominant fungal order. Our results demonstrated that the 
      fungal orders are present in different proportions in different sampling areas. 
      Redundancy analysis (RDA) revealed a significant correlation between soil 
      properties and the abundance of fungal phyla. Our results indicated lower fungal 
      diversity in the rhizosphere of Xinjiang jujube than that reported in other 
      studies, and we hope our findings provide a reference for future research.

AB  - Phytases hydrolyze phytate to release inorganic phosphate, which decreases the 
      requirement for phosphorus in fertilizers for crops and thus reduces 
      environmental pollutants. This study analyzed microbial communities in 
      rhizosphere sediment, collected in September 2012 from Shenzhen Bay, Guangdong, 
      China, using high-throughput pyrosequencing; the results showed that the dominant 
      taxonomic phyla were Chloroflexi, Firmicutes, and Proteobacteria, and the 
      proportion of the beneficial bacteria, Bacillus, was 4.95 %. Twenty-nine 
      culturable, phytase-producing bacteria were isolated, their phosphorus 
      solubilization capacity was analyzed, and they were taxonomically characterized. 
      Their phylogenetic placement was determined using 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) gene 
      sequence analysis. The result shows that most of the isolates are members of the 
      order Bacillales, although seven strains of Enterobacteriales, two strains of 
      Pseudomonadales, and one strain of Oceanospirillales were also identified. The 
      phytase gene was cloned from SPC09, Bacillus cereus, which showed the highest 
      phosphorus solubilizing ability among the isolated strains. The gene encoded a 
      primary translation product of 335 amino acids. A construct including the 1005-nt 
      ORF fragment, Bc-phy, was transformed into Escherichia coli. The recombinant 
      phytase was produced and purified, which revealed the temperature optima at 60  degrees C 
      and pH optima at 6.5. The assessment by quantitative PCR (qPCR) showed an 
      abundance of bacteria containing the Bc-phy gene; the level was generally higher 
      in the mangrove forest than in the tidal flats and in surface soil compared to 
      bottom soil, and the highest value was obtained in June. Herein, we report on the 
      cloning, characterization, and activity of a novel phytase isolated from a 
      mangrove system.

TI  - Mycorrhizal type determines the magnitude and direction of root-induced changes 
      in decomposition in a temperate forest.
PG  - 1274-82
LID - 10.1111/nph.13303 [doi]
AB  - Although it is increasingly being recognized that roots play a key role in soil 
      carbon (C) dynamics, the magnitude and direction of these effects are unknown. 
      Roots can accelerate soil C losses by provisioning microbes with energy to 
      decompose organic matter or impede soil C losses by enhancing microbial 
      competition for nutrients. We experimentally reduced belowground C supply to 
      soils via tree girdling, and contrasted responses in control and girdled plots 
      for three consecutive growing seasons. We hypothesized that decreases in 
      belowground C supply would have stronger effects in plots dominated by 
      ectomycorrhizal (ECM) trees rather than arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) trees. In 
      ECM-dominated plots, girdling decreased the activity of enzymes that break down 
      soil organic matter (SOM) by c. 40%, indicating that, in control plots, C supply 
      from ECM roots primes microbial decomposition. In AM-dominated plots, girdling 
      had little effect on SOM-degrading enzymes, but increased the decomposition of AM 
      leaf litter by c. 43%, suggesting that, in control plots, AM roots may intensify 
      microbial competition for nutrients. Our findings indicate that root-induced 
      changes in soil processes depend on forest composition, and that shifts in the 
      distribution of AM and ECM trees owing to climate change may determine soil C 
      gains and losses.

PG  - 134-47
LID - 10.1093/treephys/tpu116 [doi]
AB  - Natural abundance of (15)N (delta (15)N) was determined in bulk soil, rhizospheric 
      soil and vegetation in an organically managed cacao (Theobroma cacao L.) 
      plantation with Inga edulis Mart. legume trees (inga) as the principal shade for 
      studying the nitrogen (N) cycle in the system. Cacao without contact with legumes 
      in an adjacent plantation was used as the reference for N2 fixation and direct N 
      transfer calculations. Bulk and rhizospheric soils contained 72 and 20%, 
      respectively, of whole- system N. No vegetation effect on delta (15)N in rhizospheric 
      soil was detected, probably due to the high native soil N pool. Fine roots of the 
      cacaos associated with inga contained  approximately 35% of N fixed from the atmosphere (Nf) 
      out of the total N. Leaves of all species had significantly higher delta (15)N than 
      fine roots. Twenty percent of system Nf was found in cacao suggesting direct N 
      transfer from inga via a common mycelial network of mycorrhizal fungi or 
      recycling of N-rich root exudates of inga. Inga had accumulated 98 kg [Nf] ha(-1) 
      during the 14-year history of the plantation. The conservative estimate of 
      current N2 fixation rate was 41 kg [Nf] ha(-1) year(-1) based on inga biomass 
      only and 50 kg [Nf] ha(-1) year(-1) based on inga and associated trees.

TI  - Temporal patterns of orchid mycorrhizal fungi in meadows and forests as revealed 
      by 454 pyrosequencing.

AB  - Orchid mycorrhizal (OrM) symbionts play a key role in the growth of orchids, but 
      the temporal variation and habitat partitioning of these fungi in roots and soil 
      remain unclear. Temporal changes in root and rhizosphere fungal communities of 
      Cypripedium calceolus, Neottia ovata and Orchis militaris were studied in meadow 
      and forest habitats over the vegetation period by using 454 pyrosequencing of the 
      full internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region. The community of typical OrM 
      symbionts differed by plant species and habitats. The root fungal community of N. 
      ovata changed significantly in time, but this was not observed in C. calceolus 
      and O. militaris. The rhizosphere community included a low proportion of OrM 
      symbionts that exhibited a slight temporal turnover in meadow habitats but not in 
      forests. Habitat differences in OrM and all fungal associates are largely 
      attributable to the greater proportion of ectomycorrhizal fungi in forests. 
      Temporal changes in OrM fungal communities in roots of certain species indicate 
      selection of suitable fungal species by plants. It remains to be elucidated 
      whether these shifts depend on functional differences inside roots, seasonality, 
      climate or succession.

TI  - Site properties have a stronger influence than fire severity on ectomycorrhizal 
      fungi and associated N-cycling bacteria in regenerating post-beetle-killed 
      lodgepole pine forests.
PG  - 399-410
LID - 10.1007/s12223-014-0374-7 [doi]
AB  - Following a pine beetle epidemic in British Columbia, Canada, we investigated the 
      effect of fire severity on rhizosphere soil chemistry and ectomycorrhizal fungi 
      (ECM) and associated denitrifying and nitrogen (N)-fixing bacteria in the root 
      systems of regenerating lodgepole pine seedlings at two site types (wet and dry) 
      and three fire severities (low, moderate, and high). The site type was found to 
      have a much larger impact on all measurements than fire severity. Wet and dry 
      sites differed significantly for almost all soil properties measured, with higher 
      values identified from wet types, except for pH and percent sand that were 
      greater on dry sites. Fire severity caused few changes in soil chemical status. 
      Generally, bacterial communities differed little, whereas ECM morphotype analysis 
      revealed ectomycorrhizal diversity was lower on dry sites, with a corresponding 
      division in community structure between wet and dry sites. Molecular profiling of 
      the fungal ITS region confirmed these results, with a clear difference in 
      community structure seen between wet and dry sites. The ability of ECM fungi to 
      colonize seedlings growing in both wet and dry soils may positively contribute to 
      subsequent regeneration. We conclude that despite consecutive landscape 
      disturbances (mountain pine beetle infestation followed by wildfire), the 
      "signature" of moisture on chemistry and ECM community structure remained 
      pronounced.

AB  - The class Archaeorhizomycetes (Taphrinomycotina, Ascomycota) was introduced to 
      accommodate an ancient lineage of soil-inhabiting fungi found in association with 
      plant roots. Based on environmental sequencing data Archaeorhizomycetes may 
      comprise a significant proportion of the total fungal community in soils. Yet the 
      only species described and cultivated in this class is Archaeorhizomyces finlayi. 
      In this paper, we describe a second species from a pure culture, 
      Archaeorhizomyces borealis NS99-600(T) (=CBS138755(ExT)) based on morphological, 
      physiological, and multi-locus molecular characterization. Archaeorhizomyces 
      borealis was isolated from a root tip of a Pinus sylvestris seedling grown in a 
      forest nursery in Lithuania. Analysis of Archaeorhizomycete species from 
      environmental samples shows that it has a Eurasian distribution and is the most 
      commonly observed species. Archaeorhizomyces borealis shows slow growth in 
      culture and forms yellowish creamy colonies, characteristics that distinguish A. 
      borealis from its closest relative A. finlayi. Here we also propose a 
      sequence-based taxonomic classification of Archaeorhizomycetes and predict that 
      approximately 500 species in this class remain to be isolated and described.

TI  - Rhizosphere processes are quantitatively important components of terrestrial 
      carbon and nutrient cycles.
PG  - 2082-94
LID - 10.1111/gcb.12816 [doi]
AB  - While there is an emerging view that roots and their associated microbes actively 
      alter resource availability and soil organic matter (SOM) decomposition, the 
      ecosystem consequences of such rhizosphere effects have rarely been quantified. 
      Using a meta-analysis, we show that multiple indices of microbially mediated C 
      and nitrogen (N) cycling, including SOM decomposition, are significantly enhanced 
      in the rhizospheres of diverse vegetation types. Then, using a numerical model 
      that combines rhizosphere effect sizes with fine root morphology and depth 
      distributions, we show that root-accelerated mineralization and priming can 
      account for up to one-third of the total C and N mineralized in temperate forest 
      soils. Finally, using a stoichiometrically constrained microbial decomposition 
      model, we show that these effects can be induced by relatively modest fluxes of 
      root-derived C, on the order of 4% and 6% of gross and net primary production, 
      respectively. Collectively, our results indicate that rhizosphere processes are a 
      widespread, quantitatively important driver of SOM decomposition and nutrient 
      release at the ecosystem scale, with potential consequences for global C stocks 
      and vegetation feedbacks to climate.

TI  - Symphyotrichum ericoides populations from seleniferous and nonseleniferous soil 
      display striking variation in selenium accumulation.
PG  - 231-242
LID - 10.1111/nph.13164 [doi]
AB  - Symphyotrichum ericoides (Asteraceae) from naturally seleniferous habitat (Pine 
      Ridge) was shown previously to have selenium (Se) hyperaccumulator properties in 
      field and glasshouse studies, and to benefit from Se through protection from 
      herbivory. To investigate whether Se hyperaccumulation is ubiquitous in 
      S. ericoides or restricted to seleniferous soils, the S. ericoides Pine Ridge 
      (PR) population was compared with the nearby Cloudy Pass (CP) population from 
      nonseleniferous soil. The S. ericoidesPR and CP populations were strikingly 
      physiologically different: in a common garden experiment, PR plants accumulated 
      up to 40-fold higher Se concentrations than CP plants and had 10-fold higher 
      Se : sulfur (S) ratios. Moreover, roots of S. ericoidesPR plants showed 
      directional growth toward selenate, while CP roots did not. Growth of both 
      accessions responded positively to Se. Each accession grew best on its own soil. 
      Rhizosphere soil inoculum from the S. ericoidesPR population stimulated plant 
      growth and Se accumulation in both S. ericoidesPR and S. ericoidesCP plants, on 
      both PR and CP soils. While the S. ericoidesPR population hyperaccumulates Se, 
      the nearby CP population does not. The capacity of S. ericoidesPR plants to 
      hyperaccumulate Se appears to be a local phenomenon that is restricted to 
      seleniferous soil. Mutualistic rhizosphere microbes of the S. ericoidesPR 
      population may contribute to the hyperaccumulation phenotype.

TI  - The rhizosphere and hyphosphere differ in their impacts on carbon and nitrogen 
      cycling in forests exposed to elevated CO(2).
PG  - 1164-1174
LID - 10.1111/nph.13122 [doi]
AB  - While multiple experiments have demonstrated that trees exposed to elevated CO(2) 
      can stimulate microbes to release nutrients from soil organic matter, the 
      importance of root- versus mycorrhizal-induced changes in soil processes are 
      presently unknown. We analyzed the contribution of roots and mycorrhizal 
      activities to carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) turnover in a loblolly pine (Pinus 
      taeda) forest exposed to elevated CO(2) by measuring extracellular enzyme 
      activities at soil microsites accessed via root windows. Specifically, we 
      quantified enzyme activity from soil adjacent to root tips (rhizosphere), soil 
      adjacent to hyphal tips (hyphosphere), and bulk soil. During the peak growing 
      season, CO(2) enrichment induced a greater increase of N-releasing enzymes in the 
      rhizosphere (215% increase) than in the hyphosphere (36% increase), but a greater 
      increase of recalcitrant C-degrading enzymes in the hyphosphere (118%) than in 
      the rhizosphere (19%). Nitrogen fertilization influenced the magnitude of CO(2) 
      effects on enzyme activities in the rhizosphere only. At the ecosystem scale, the 
      rhizosphere accounted for c. 50% and 40% of the total activity of N- and 
      C-releasing enzymes, respectively. Collectively, our results suggest that root 
      exudates may contribute more to accelerated N cycling under elevated CO(2) at this 
      site, while mycorrhizal fungi may contribute more to soil C degradation.

AB  - Sustainable management of crop productivity and health necessitates improved 
      understanding of the ways in which rhizosphere microbial populations interact 
      with each other, with plant roots and their abiotic environment. In this study we 
      examined the effects of different soils and cultivars, and the presence of a 
      soil-borne fungal pathogen, Verticillium dahliae, on the fungal microbiome of the 
      rhizosphere soil and roots of strawberry plants, using high-throughput 
      pyrosequencing. Fungal communities of the roots of two cultivars, Honeoye and 
      Florence, were statistically distinct from those in the rhizosphere soil of the 
      same plants, with little overlap. Roots of plants growing in two contrasting 
      field soils had high relative abundance of Leptodontidium sp. C2 BESC 319 g 
      whereas rhizosphere soil was characterised by high relative abundance of 
      Trichosporon dulcitum or Cryptococcus terreus, depending upon the soil type. 
      Differences between different cultivars were not as clear. Inoculation with the 
      pathogen V. dahliae had a significant influence on community structure, generally 
      decreasing the number of rhizosphere soil- and root-inhabiting fungi. 
      Leptodontidium sp. C2 BESC 319 g was the dominant fungus responding positively to 
      inoculation with V. dahliae. The results suggest that 1) plant roots select 
      microorganisms from the wider rhizosphere pool, 2) that both rhizosphere soil and 
      root inhabiting fungal communities are influenced by V. dahliae and 3) that soil 
      type has a stronger influence on both of these communities than cultivar.

TI  - Soil propagule banks of ectomycorrhizal fungi along forest development stages 
      after mining.
PG  - 768-77

AB  - Ectomycorrhizal fungal (EMF) propagules play an important role in seedling 
      establishment following disturbance. However, little is known about how the EMF 
      propagule community changes with forest development. In this study, EMF 
      propagules were examined using seedling bioassays in rhizosphere soils collected 
      from a recently closed Pb-Zn tailing (Taolin Pb-Zn tailing (TLT)), a Cu tailing 
      (Dexing Cu No. 2 tailing (DXT)) that had undergone 21 years of restoration, and a 
      mature Masson pine (Pinus massoniana) forest (DXC) outside the Cu mining areas. 
      The corresponding EMF communities colonizing Masson pine at each site were also 
      investigated for comparison. After 8 months of running bioassays, ectomycorrhizal 
      colonization was poor for seedlings grown in TLT (9.0 % +/- 14.9 %) and DXT soils 
      (22.4 % +/- 17.7 %), while DXC seedlings were well colonized (47.5 % +/- 24.9 %). 
      Internal transcribed spacer sequencing revealed that EMF species richness 
      increased with forest development in both the propagule bank (TLT, 6; DXT, 7; 
      DXC, 12) and in the field (TLT, 8; DXT, 14; DXC, 26), though richness was lower 
      in propagule banks. Several lineages, such as Cenococcum, Rhizopogon, Inocybe, 
      Suillus, and Atheliaceae, were frequently encountered in propagule communities, 
      but species assemblages were different among the three sites. Canonical 
      correspondence analysis revealed that several soil parameters, i.e., N, EC, Cu, 
      Pb, Zn, etc., were responsible for the distribution of EMF in the field and 
      bioassay seedlings. The highest overlap in EMF species composition between the 
      propagule bank and the field community was observed at the recently closed 
      tailing (Morisita-Horn similarity = 0.71 for TLT), whereas the lowest overlap 
      occurred at the mature forest (0.26 for DXC). These results indicate that EMF 
      propagules in soil are less frequent and diverse in early primary succession and 
      become more frequent and diverse along forest development, due mainly to the 
      accumulation of dormant spores of Rhizopogon spp. and sclerotia of Cenococcum 
      spp. Thus, EMF propagule communities in soil may diverge from those 
      root-colonizing EMF communities along a gradient of forest development.

TI  - Effects of variation in precipitation on the distribution of soil bacterial 
      diversity in the primitive Korean pine and broadleaved forests.
PG  - 2975-84
LID - 10.1007/s11274-014-1725-x [doi]
AB  - Patterns of precipitation have changed as a result of climate change and will 
      potentially keep changing in the future. Therefore, it is critical to understand 
      how ecosystem processes will respond to the variation of precipitation. However, 
      compared to aboveground processes, the effects of precipitation change on soil 
      microorganisms remain poorly understood. Changbai Mountain is an ideal area to 
      study the responses of temperate forests to the variations in precipitation. In 
      this study, we conducted a manipulation experiment to simulation variation of 
      precipitation in the virgin, broad-leaved Korean pine mixed forest in Changbai 
      Mountain. Plots were designed to increase precipitation by 30 % [increased (+)] 
      or decrease precipitation by 30 % [decreased (-)]. We analyzed differences in the 
      diversity of the bacterial community in surface bulk soils (0-5 and 5-10 cm) and 
      rhizosphere soils between precipitation treatments, including control. Bacteria 
      were identified using the high-throughput 454 sequencing method. We obtained a 
      total 271,496 optimized sequences, with a mean value of 33,242 (+/-1,412.39) 
      sequences for each soil sample. Being the same among the sample plots with 
      different precipitation levels, the dominant bacterial communities were 
      Proteobacteria, Acidobacteria, Actinobacteria, Planctomycetes, and Chloroflexi. 
      Bacterial diversity and abundance declined with increasing soil depth. In the 
      bulk soil of 0-5 cm, the bacterial diversity and abundance was the highest in the 
      control plots and the lowest in plots with reduced precipitation. However, in the 
      soil of 5-10 cm, the diversity and abundance of bacteria was the highest in the 
      plots of increased precipitation and the lowest in the control plots. Bacterial 
      diversity and abundance in rhizosphere soils decreased with increased 
      precipitation. This result implies that variation in precipitation did not change 
      the composition of the dominant bacterial communities but affected bacterial 
      abundance and the response patterns of the dominant communities to variation in 
      precipitation.

PG  - 123-7

AB  - Rhizobacteria with biocontrol ability exploit a range of mechanisms to compete 
      successfully with other microorganisms and to ensure their growth and survival in 
      the rhizosphere, ultimately promoting plant growth. The rhizobacterium Serratia 
      plymuthica AS13 is able to promote oilseed rape growth and improve seedling 
      survival in the presence of the fungal pathogen, Rhizoctonia solani AG 2-1; 
      however, our understanding of the mechanisms underlying the antagonism of 
      Serratia is limited. To elucidate possible mechanisms, genome-wide gene 
      expression profiling of S. plymuthica AS13 was carried out in the presence or 
      absence of R. solani. We used RNA sequencing methodology to obtain a 
      comprehensive overview of Serratia gene expression in response to R. solani. The 
      differential gene expression profiles of S. plymuthica AS13 revealed 
      significantly increased expression of genes related to the biosynthesis of the 
      antibiotic pyrrolnitrin (prnABCD), protease production and transporters. The 
      results presented here provide evidence that antibiosis is a major functional 
      mechanism underlying the antagonistic behaviour of S. plymuthica AS13.

      rhizosphere bacterial communities.
PG  - 855-66
LID - 10.1007/s00248-014-0472-8 [doi]
AB  - Amazonian Dark Earths (ADE) or Terra Preta de Indio formed in the past by 
      pre-Columbian populations are highly sustained fertile soils supported by 
      microbial communities that differ from those extant in adjacent soils. These 
      soils are found in the Amazon region and are considered as a model soil when 
      compared to the surrounding and background soils. The aim of this study was to 
      assess the effects of ADE and its surrounding soil on the rhizosphere bacterial 
      communities of two leguminous plant species that frequently occur in the Amazon 
      region in forest sites (Mimosa debilis) and open areas (Senna alata). Bacterial 
      community structure was evaluated using terminal restriction fragment length 
      polymorphism (T-RFLP) and bacterial community composition by V4 16S rRNA gene 
      region pyrosequencing. T-RFLP analysis showed effect of soil types and plant 
      species on rhizosphere bacterial community structure. Differential abundance of 
      bacterial phyla, such as Acidobacteria, Actinobacteria, Verrucomicrobia, and 
      Firmicutes, revealed that soil type contributes to shape the bacterial 
      communities. Furthermore, bacterial phyla such as Firmicutes and Nitrospira were 
      mostly influenced by plant species. Plant roots influenced several soil chemical 
      properties, especially when plants were grown in ADE. These results showed that 
      differences observed in rhizosphere bacterial community structure and composition 
      can be influenced by plant species and soil fertility due to variation in soil 
      attributes.

TI  - Occurrence of Phytophthora plurivora and other Phytophthora species in oak 
      forests of southern Poland and their association with site conditions and the 
      health status of trees.
PG  - 531-42
LID - 10.1007/s12223-014-0331-5 [doi]
AB  - Phytophthora plurivora and other Phytophthora species are known to be serious 
      pathogens of forest trees. Little is known, however, about the presence of P. 
      plurivora in Polish oak forests and their role in oak decline. The aims of this 
      study were to identify P. plurivora in healthy and declining Quercus robur stands 
      in southern Poland and to demonstrate the relationship between different site 
      factors and the occurrence of P. plurivora. In addition, the virulence of P. 
      plurivora and other Phytophthora species was evaluated through inoculations using 
      2-year-old oak seedlings. Rhizosphere soil was investigated from 39 oak stands 
      representing different healthy tree statuses. The morphology and DNA sequences of 
      the internal transcribed spacer regions (ITS) of the ribosomal DNA and the 
      mitochondrial cox1 gene were used for identifications. P. plurivora, an oak fine 
      root pathogen, was isolated from rhizosphere soil samples in 6 out of 39 stands. 
      Additionally, Phytophthora cambivora, Phytophthora polonica and Phytophthora 
      rosacearum-like were also obtained from several stands. The results showed a 
      significant association between the presence of P. plurivora and the health 
      status of oak trees. Similar relationships were also observed for all identified 
      Phytophthora species. In addition, there was evidence for a connection between 
      the presence of all identified Phytophthora species and some site conditions. 
      Phytophthora spp. occurred more frequently in declining stands and in silt loam 
      and sandy loam soils with pH >/= 3.66. P. plurivora and P. cambivora were the only 
      species capable of killing whole plants, producing extensive necrosis on seedling 
      stems.

AB  - This review summarizes the bioremediation and phytoremediation technologies 
      proposed so far to detoxify PCB-contaminated sites. A critical analysis about the 
      potential and limits of the PCB pollution treatment strategies by means of 
      plants, fungi and bacteria are elucidated, including the new insights emerged 
      from recent studies on the rhizosphere potential and on the implementation of 
      simultaneous aerobic and anaerobic biodegradation processes. The review describes 
      the biodegradation and phytoremediation processes and elaborates on the 
      environmental variables affecting contaminant degradation rates, summarizing the 
      amendments recommended to enhance PCB degradation. Additionally, issues connected 
      with PCB toxicology, actual field remediation strategies and economical 
      evaluation are discussed.

TI  - Root exudation of phytosiderophores from soil-grown wheat.
PG  - 1161-1174
LID - 10.1111/nph.12868 [doi]
AB  - For the first time, phytosiderophore (PS) release of wheat (Triticum aestivum cv 
      Tamaro) grown on a calcareous soil was repeatedly and nondestructively sampled 
      using rhizoboxes combined with a recently developed root exudate collecting tool. 
      As in nutrient solution culture, we observed a distinct diurnal release rhythm; 
      however, the measured PS efflux was c. 50 times lower than PS exudation from the 
      same cultivar grown in zero iron (Fe)-hydroponic culture. Phytosiderophore 
      rhizosphere soil solution concentrations and PS release of the Tamaro cultivar 
      were soil-dependent, suggesting complex interactions of soil characteristics 
      (salinity, trace metal availability) and the physiological status of the plant 
      and the related regulation (amount and timing) of PS release. Our results 
      demonstrate that carbon and energy investment into Fe acquisition under natural 
      growth conditions is significantly smaller than previously derived from zero 
      Fe-hydroponic studies. Based on experimental data, we calculated that during the 
      investigated period (21-47 d after germination), PS release initially exceeded Fe 
      plant uptake 10-fold, but significantly declined after c. 5 wk after germination. 
      Phytosiderophore exudation observed under natural growth conditions is a 
      prerequisite for a more accurate and realistic assessment of Fe mobilization 
      processes in the rhizosphere using both experimental and modeling approaches.

TI  - Does the aboveground herbivore assemblage influence soil bacterial community 
      composition and richness in subalpine grasslands?
PG  - 584-95
LID - 10.1007/s00248-014-0435-0 [doi]
AB  - Grassland ecosystems support large communities of aboveground herbivores that are 
      known to directly and indirectly affect belowground properties such as the 
      microbial community composition, richness, or biomass. Even though multiple 
      species of functionally different herbivores coexist in grassland ecosystems, 
      most studies have only considered the impact of a single group, i.e., large 
      ungulates (mostly domestic livestock) on microbial communities. Thus, we 
      investigated how the exclusion of four groups of functionally different 
      herbivores affects bacterial community composition, richness, and biomass in two 
      vegetation types with different grazing histories. We progressively excluded 
      large, medium, and small mammals as well as invertebrate herbivores using 
      exclosures at 18 subalpine grassland sites (9 per vegetation type). We assessed 
      the bacterial community composition using terminal restriction fragment length 
      polymorphism (T-RFLP) at each site and exclosure type during three consecutive 
      growing seasons (2009-2011) for rhizosphere and mineral soil separately. In 
      addition, we determined microbial biomass carbon (MBC), root biomass, plant 
      carbon:nitrogen ratio, soil temperature, and soil moisture. Even though several 
      of these variables were affected by herbivore exclusion and vegetation type, 
      against our expectations, bacterial community composition, richness, or MBC were 
      not. Yet, bacterial communities strongly differed between the three growing 
      seasons as well as to some extent between our study sites. Thus, our study 
      indicates that the spatiotemporal variability in soil microclimate has much 
      stronger effects on the soil bacterial communities than the grazing regime or the 
      composition of the vegetation in this high-elevation ecosystem.

      specific to their plant hosts, suggesting that plant species-specific traits may 
      drive the selection of microbial species that comprise their microbiomes. To 
      further examine the degree to which the plant taxa drive the assemblage of 
      bacterial communities in specific plant microenvironments, we evaluated bacterial 
      community structures associated with the phyllosphere, dermosphere, and 
      rhizosphere of seven tree species representing three orders, four families and 
      four genera of plants from a pristine Dense Ombrophilous Atlantic forest in 
      Brazil, using a combination of PCR-DGGE of 16S rRNA genes and clone library 
      sequencing. Results indicated that each plant species selected for distinct 
      bacterial communities in the phyllosphere, dermosphere, and rhizosphere, and that 
      the bacterial community structures are significantly related to the plant taxa, 
      at the species, family, and order levels. Further characterization of the 
      bacterial communities of the phyllosphere and dermosphere of the tree species 
      showed that they were inhabited predominantly by species of Gammaproteobacteria, 
      mostly related to Pseudomonas. In contrast, the rhizosphere bacterial communities 
      showed greater species richness and evenness, and higher frequencies of 
      Alphaproteobacteria and Acidobacteria Gp1. With individual tree species each 
      selecting for their specific microbiomes, these findings greatly increase our 
      estimates of the bacterial species richness in tropical forests and provoke 
      questions concerning the ecological functions of the microbial communities that 
      exist on different plant parts.

AB  - In order to identify the species of Helicotylenchus Steiner, 1945 present in 
      Iran, 497 soil and root samples were collected from the rhizosphere of different 
      plants and localities throughout the country during 2009-2010. A new and several 
      known species of Helicotylenchus were identified from the collected material. H. 
      persiaensis sp. n. is characterized by its short tail (8-11 microm , c = 54.2-79.0, 
      c' = 0.6-1.2), usually with smooth terminus or with 1-3 very coarse annules, 
      rarely with minor ventral, dorsal or lateral projection, conical and truncate 
      head with 4-5 distinct annules, stylet 22-26 microm long with anteriorly flattened 
      knobs, relatively short body length (570-730 microm) and absence of males. This 
      species was collected from the rhizosphere of zelkova (Zelkova carpinifolia) and 
      maple (Acer sp.) forest trees in Golestan province, northern Iran. Also observed 
      were H. abunaamai Siddiqi, 1972, with a small ventral projection at the tail 
      terminus, and H. crenacauda Sher, 1966, with long projection and indented 
      terminus, collected from sugarcane (Haft-Tapeh, Khuzestan province) and rice 
      rhizosphere (Chabok-Sar, Gilan province), respectively. This is the first report 
      of H. abunaamai from Iran. New data on H. crenacauda are provided.

AB  - A Gram-positive, yellow pigmented strain, BKS 3-46(T) was isolated from a soil 
      sample collected from the rhizosphere of Ficus benghalensis (banyan tree) in 
      Bhitarkanika mangrove forest, in the Indian state of Odisha, and subjected to 
      polyphasic taxonomic study. The 16S rRNA gene sequence of the strain was 
      determined and the sequence analysis showed that strain BKS 3-46(T) should be 
      assigned to the genus Isoptericola. The chemotaxonomic data supported this 
      taxonomic placement i.e. presence of menaquinone MK-9(H4); major fatty acids 
      anteiso C15:0 and iso-C15:0; and phosphatidylglycerol, diphosphatidylglycerol and 
      phosphatidylinositol (PI) as major polar lipids. Further phylogenetic analysis of 
      the 16S rRNA gene sequence confirmed that the strain BKS 3-46(T) belongs to the 
      genus Isoptericola and is closely related to Isoptericola halotolerans MTCC 
      11265(T) (98.6 %) followed by Isoptericola nanjingensis MTCC 11633(T) (98.4 %) 
      and Isoptericola chiayiensis MTCC 11634(T) (98.1 %). However, the DNA-DNA 
      hybridization values obtained between strain BKS 3-46(T) and other related 
      strains were well below the threshold that is required for the proposal of a 
      novel species. The G+C content of the genomic DNA was determined to be 70.4 mol%. 
      The phenotypic and genotypic data showed that the strain BKS 3-46(T) merits the 
      recognition as a representative of a novel species of the genus Isoptericola. It 
      is proposed that the isolate should be classified in the genus Isoptericola as a 
      novel species, Isoptericola rhizophila sp. nov. The type strain is BKS 3-46(T) 
      (=MTCC 11080(T)=JCM 19252(T)).

      contrasting conifers.
PG  - 513-23
LID - 10.1093/treephys/tpu028 [doi]
AB  - Plant species may show a preference for uptake of particular nitrogen (N) forms, 
      but little is known about how N form preference is influenced by soil 
      temperature. Potential future changes in soil N form availability and plant N 
      form preference in warmer soils might shift competitive interactions among forest 
      tree species. We compared the N uptake and growth of three conifer species from 
      contrasting environments grown at rhizosphere temperatures of 10, 16 or 20  degrees C and 
      supplied with ammonium (NH4 (+)) or nitrate (NO3 (-)) or a mix of arginine and 
      alanine. Short-term N uptake was assessed using ion-selective microelectrodes and 
      application of (15)N, and long-term uptake was assessed by plant N status. 
      Species exhibited preferences for particular N forms, and these preferences 
      related to the N form most available in native soils. Specifically, Douglas-fir 
      (Pseudotsuga menziesii (Mirb.) Franco) showed a preference for nitrate (a N form 
      commonly found in warmer areas), Sitka spruce (Picea sitchensis (Bong.) Carr.) 
      preferred ammonium (a N form abundant in cold soils) and Engelmann spruce (Picea 
      engelmannii Parry ex Engelm.) showed a preference for ammonium and organic N 
      (organic N is often abundant in cold soils). Relative N form preference, as 
      indicated by plant growth, changed with temperature in some species, indicating 
      that these species could acclimate to changing rhizosphere temperatures. 
      Understanding how conifers utilize available soil nutrients at different 
      temperatures can help to predict species' future performance as soil temperatures 
      rise.

TI  - [Root exudates and soil microbes in three Picea asperata plantations with 
      different stand ages].
PG  - 325-32
AB  - This study investigated the dynamics of in situ root exudates and soil microbial 
      composition among three Picea asperata plantations with different stand ages (9, 
      13 and 31 a) in Miyaluo, west Sichuan, China. The results showed that the 
      secretion rates of root exudation per fine biomass, length, surface area and tip 
      were significantly different among the three plantations with different stand 
      ages. The secretion rate of root exudation was the highest in the 9-year-old 
      plantation stand. The root activity of P. asperata was the weakest in the 
      13-year-old plantation stand. Besides, soil microbial biomass C (MBC) and N (MBN) 
      between rhizosphere and non-rhizosphere soils were significantly different among 
      the three plantation stands. MBC and MBN contents of rhizosphere soil gradually 
      increased with stand ages, while those of non-rhizosphere soil were the largest 
      in the 13-year-old plantation stand. The phospholipid fatty acids (PLFAs) of 
      bacteria, fungi, actinomycetes and their summation in rhizosphere soil presented 
      a trend of high-low-high with stand ages. The opposite pattern was found in the 
      PLFAs of bacteria, fungi, the summation of PLFA, and the ratio of fungi number to 
      bacteria in non-rhizosphere soil. It is suggested that root exudates might have a 
      positive rhizosphere effect on soil microbial biomass C, N and PLFAs of 
      functional groups.

AB  - Water is the key resource limiting world agricultural production. Although an 
      impressive number of research reports have been published on plant drought 
      tolerance enhancement via genetic modifications during the last few years, 
      progress has been slower than expected. We suggest a feasible alternative 
      strategy by application of rhizospheric bacteria coevolved with plant roots in 
      harsh environments over millions of years, and harboring adaptive traits 
      improving plant fitness under biotic and abiotic stresses. We show the effect of 
      bacterial priming on wheat drought stress tolerance enhancement, resulting in up 
      to 78% greater plant biomass and five-fold higher survivorship under severe 
      drought. We monitored emissions of seven stress-related volatiles from 
      bacterially-primed drought-stressed wheat seedlings, and demonstrated that three 
      of these volatiles are likely promising candidates for a rapid non-invasive 
      technique to assess crop drought stress and its mitigation in early phases of 
      stress development. We conclude that gauging stress by elicited volatiles 
      provides an effectual platform for rapid screening of potent bacterial strains 
      and that priming with isolates of rhizospheric bacteria from harsh environments 
      is a promising, novel way to improve plant water use efficiency. These new 
      advancements importantly contribute towards solving food security issues in 
      changing climates.

AB  - The effects of the interaction between Suillus luteus (L.) Roussel and 
      Trichoderma virens (J.H. Mill., Giddens & A.A. Foster) Arx on Pinus sylvestris 
      var. mongolica Litv. were studied using plant physiology, mycorrhizal science, 
      forest pathology, and biochemistry. Seedling growth and physiological parameters 
      were determined, including the colonization rate of mycorrhizal fungi, biomass, 
      root activity, photosynthetic pigment content, soluble protein content, 
      antioxidant enzyme activities, rhizosphere soil enzyme activities, and protective 
      enzyme activities. In addition, an optimal resistance system involving T. virens, 
      mycorrhizal fungus (S. luteus), and P. sylvestris var. mongolica seedlings was 
      constructed. Synergies between S. luteus and T. virens were observed, and most of 
      the parameters of P. sylvestris var. mongolica seedlings inoculated with S. 
      luteus 30 days + T. virens were higher than other treatments. After three months, 
      when compared the control, the S. luteus 30 days + T. virens treatment gave 
      increases in height (42.3 %); collar diameter (66.7 %); fresh weight (54 %); dry 
      weight (50 %); soluble protein content (69.86 %); root activity (150 %); 
      chlorophyll a (77.6 %); chlorophyll b (70.5 %); carotenoids (144 %); CAT activity 
      (876.9 %); POD activity (268.3 %); SOD activity (66.18 %); beta-1,3-glucanase 
      activity (125.8 %); chitinase activity (40 %); rhizosphere soil catalase activity 
      (97.8 %); and phosphatase activity (266.7 %). These results indicate that there 
      may be a stimulating factor between S. luteus and T. virens when they are 
      inoculated together (S. luteus 30 days + T. virens).

TI  - Taxonomic and functional profiles of soil samples from Atlantic forest and 
      Caatinga biomes in northeastern Brazil.
PG  - 299-315

AB  - Although microorganisms play crucial roles in ecosystems, metagenomic analyses of 
      soil samples are quite scarce, especially in the Southern Hemisphere. In this 
      work, the microbial diversity of soil samples from an Atlantic Forest and 
      Caatinga was analyzed using a metagenomic approach. Proteobacteria and 
      Actinobacteria were the dominant phyla in both samples. Among which, a 
      significant proportion of stress-resistant bacteria associated to organic matter 
      degradation was found. Sequences related to metabolism of amino acids, nitrogen, 
      and DNA and stress resistance were more frequent in Caatinga soil, while the 
      forest sample showed the highest occurrence of hits annotated in phosphorous 
      metabolism, defense mechanisms, and aromatic compound degradation subsystems. The 
      principal component analysis (PCA) showed that our samples are close to the 
      desert metagenomes in relation to taxonomy, but are more similar to rhizosphere 
      microbiota in relation to the functional profiles. The data indicate that soil 
      characteristics affect the taxonomic and functional distribution; these 
      characteristics include low nutrient content, high drainage (both are sandy 
      soils), vegetation, and exposure to stress. In both samples, a rapid turnover of 
      organic matter with low greenhouse gas emission was suggested by the functional 
      profiles obtained, reinforcing the importance of preserving natural areas.

TI  - First Report of Phytophthora plurivora Causing Collar Rot on Common Alder in 
      Spain.
PG  - 425
LID - 10.1094/PDIS-07-13-0784-PDN [doi]
AB  - Phytophthora decline of riparian alder (Alnus spp.) has been reported in several 
      European countries (2). Death of common alder (Alnus glutinosa) due to 
      Phytophthora alni has also been reported in Spain (4). During several surveys of 
      alder trees in September 2012, typical dieback symptoms, including sparse small 
      yellowish foliage and the presence of rusty exudates on the bark at the collar 
      and lower stem were observed in A. glutinosa growing on the banks of the river 
      Tera (Langa de Duero, Soria, 41 degrees 36'34'' N, 3 degrees 25'10'' W, elevation 851 m) and the 
      river Tormes (La Maya, Salamanca, 40 degrees 41'42'' N, 5 degrees 35'36'' W, elevation 833 m). Bark 
      samples plus cambium were taken from the active lesions at collar region, cut 
      into small pieces, dried on filter paper, and plated on V8-PARPH agar (2). The 
      samples were incubated for 4 days at 20 degrees C in the dark before obtaining the 
      Phytophthora isolates. Colonies developed on V8 juice agar (V8A) had limited 
      aerial mycelium at the center and displayed radiate and slightly 
      chrysanthemum-like growth pattern. Mycelial growth was optimal at 25 degrees C (radial 
      growth rate, 8.2 mm d(-1)), whereas no growth was observed at 32 degrees C. Isolates were 
      homothallic with paragynous antheridia, smooth-walled spherical (very rarely 
      elongated) oogonia (22.8 to 30.6 mum diam.) and both plerotic and aplerotic golden 
      brown oospores (21.3 to 28.5 mum diam.). In non-sterile soil extracts, the 
      isolates produced abundant sporangia (31.5 to 57.2 x 21.3 to 38.4 mum; 
      length:breadth ratio 1.2 to 1.6) borne terminally on unbranched or sympodial 
      sporagiophores, occasionally attached laterally to the sporangiophores. Sporagia 
      were non-caducous, semipapillate, mainly ovoid and obpyriform, obovoid to 
      limoniform but sometimes distorted with two apices. On the basis of the 
      morpho-physiological features, the isolates resembled P. plurivora (formerly 
      identified as P. citricola) (3). To confirm this, genomic DNA was extracted and 
      subjected to PCR. The internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region of the rDNA was 
      amplified using the ITS-6 (5' GAAGGTGAAGTCGTAACAAGG 3') and ITS-4 (5' 
      TCCTCCGCTTATTGATATGC 3') primers before sequencing (Secugen, Madrid, Spain). The 
      sequences were deposited in the EMBL/GenBank database (Accession Nos. KF413074 
      and KF413075). In order to perform the pathogenicity test, 10 A. glutinosa 
      seedlings (2 years old) per isolate were inoculated by using the under-bark 
      inoculation technique (1) and 10 control seedlings were inoculated with V8A. 
      Seedlings were incubated in a growth chamber at 22.5 degrees C with a 14-h photoperiod. 
      Three months after inoculation, all inoculated plants wilted and died, whereas 
      the control plants showed no disease symptoms. To fulfill Koch's postulates, the 
      pathogen was re-isolated from the necrotic lesions developed around inoculation 
      points, thus confirming its pathogenicity. P. plurivora has been found to be 
      present in rhizosphere soil beneath Alnus spp. and to cause aerial canker and 
      collar rot on alder trees in Austria, Germany, and Romania (2,3). Further studies 
      and surveys are essential to determine the distribution, extent of damage, and 
      potential interactions with other alder pathogens (e.g., P. alni). To our 
      knowledge, this is the first record of P. plurivora affecting A. glutinosa in 
      Spain. References: (1) T. Jung et al. Eur. J. For. Pathol. 26:253, 1996. (2) T.

TI  - Taxonomical and functional microbial community selection in soybean rhizosphere.
PG  - 1577-87
LID - 10.1038/ismej.2014.17 [doi]
AB  - This study addressed the selection of the rhizospheric microbial community from 
      the bulk soil reservoir under agricultural management of soybean in Amazon forest 
      soils. We used a shotgun metagenomics approach to investigate the taxonomic and 
      functional diversities of microbial communities in the bulk soil and in the 
      rhizosphere of soybean plants and tested the validity of neutral and niche 
      theories to explain the rhizosphere community assembly processes. Our results 
      showed a clear selection at both taxonomic and functional levels operating in the 
      assembly of the soybean rhizosphere community. The taxonomic analysis revealed 
      that the rhizosphere community is a subset of the bulk soil community. Species 
      abundance in rhizosphere fits the log-normal distribution model, which is an 
      indicator of the occurrence of niche-based processes. In addition, the data 
      indicate that the rhizosphere community is selected based on functional cores 
      related to the metabolisms of nitrogen, iron, phosphorus and potassium, which are 
      related to benefits to the plant, such as growth promotion and nutrition. The 
      network analysis including bacterial groups and functions was less complex in 
      rhizosphere, suggesting the specialization of some specific metabolic pathways. 
      We conclude that the assembly of the microbial community in the rhizosphere is 
      based on niche-based processes as a result of the selection power of the plant 
      and other environmental factors.

AB  - Serratia proteamaculans S4 (previously Serratia sp. S4), isolated from the 
      rhizosphere of wild Equisetum sp., has the ability to stimulate plant growth and 
      to suppress the growth of several soil-borne fungal pathogens of economically 
      important crops. Here we present the non-contiguous, finished genome sequence of 
      S. proteamaculans S4, which consists of a 5,324,944 bp circular chromosome and a 
      129,797 bp circular plasmid. The chromosome contains 5,008 predicted genes while 
      the plasmid comprises 134 predicted genes. In total, 4,993 genes are assigned as 
      protein-coding genes. The genome consists of 22 rRNA genes, 82 tRNA genes and 58 
      pseudogenes. This genome is a part of the project "Genomics of four rapeseed 
      plant growth-promoting bacteria with antagonistic effect on plant pathogens" 
      awarded through the 2010 DOE-JGI's Community Sequencing Program.

      (Araucaria angustifolia) and Slash Pine (Pinus elliottii).
PG  - 663-9
LID - 10.1007/s10482-014-0120-9 [doi]
AB  - Araucaria forests in Brazil today correspond to only 0.7 % of the original 200 
      km(2) of natural forest that covered a great part of the southern and 
      southeastern area of the Atlantic Forest and, although Araucaria angustifolia is 
      an endangered species, illegal exploitation is still going on. As an alternative 
      to the use of hardwoods, Pinus elliottii presents rapid growth and high tolerance 
      to climatic stress and low soil fertility or degraded areas. Thus, the objective 
      of this study was to evaluate the effect of IAA-producing bacteria on the 
      development of A. angustifolia and P. elliottii. We used five bacterial strains 
      previously isolated from the rhizosphere of A. angustifolia, which produce 
      quantities of IAA ranging from 3 to 126 mug mL(-1). Microbiolized seeds were sown 
      in a new gnotobiotic system developed for this work, that allowed the 
      quantification of the plant hormone IAA produced by bacteria, and the evaluation 
      of its effect on seedling development. Also, it was shown that P. elliottii roots 
      were almost as satisfactory as hosts for these IAA producers as A. angustifolia, 
      while different magnitudes of mass increases were found for each species. Thus, 
      we suggest that these microbial groups can be helpful for the development and 
      reestablishment of already degraded forests and that PGPR isolated from Araucaria 
      rhizosphere have the potential to be beneficial in seedling production of P. 
      elliottii. Another finding is that our newly developed gnotobiotic system is 
      highly satisfactory for the evaluation of this effect.

AB  - Chinese pine (Pinus tabulaeformis Carr.) is widely planted for restoration in 
      destroyed ecosystems of the Loess Plateau in China. Although soil microbial 
      communities are important subsurface components of the terrestrial ecosystems, 
      little is known about fungal and bacterial communities in the rhizosphere of 
      planted and natural P. tabulaeformis forests in the region. In this study, fungal 
      and bacterial communities in the rhizosphere of P. tabulaeformis were analyzed by 
      nested PCR-DGGE (denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis). Diversity analysis 
      revealed that the values of the Shannon-Wiener index (H) and the Simpson index 
      (D) of fungal communities were higher in natural secondary forests than in 
      plantations except for the 3-year-old site. Moreover, the values of species 
      richness, H, and D of the bacterial communities were also higher in the former. 
      Totally, 18 fungal and 19 bacterial DGGE band types were successfully retrieved 
      and sequenced. The dominant fungi in the rhizosphere of P. tabulaeformis belonged 
      to the phylum of Basidiomycota, while the dominant bacteria belonged to the 
      phylum of Proteobacteria. Principal component analysis indicated that fungal and 
      bacterial species were more unitary in plantations than in natural secondary 
      forests, and the majority of them were more likely to appear in the latter. 
      Correlation analysis showed no significant correlation between the fungal and 
      bacterial community diversities.

TI  - Dieback and Mortality of Pinus radiata Trees in Italy Associated with 
      Phytophthora cryptogea.
PG  - 159
LID - 10.1094/PDIS-05-13-0572-PDN [doi]
AB  - Pinus radiata D. Don is a forest tree species native to the Monterey Baja in 
      California. Due to its rapid growth and desirable lumber and pulp qualities, 
      between 1960 and 1980, about 12,000 ha of P. radiata were planted in Sardinia, 
      Italy. The only disease reported on this conifer species has been Diplodia pinea, 
      which causes tip and branch dieback (3). In January 2012, dieback and mortality 
      of 25-year-old radiata pine trees were observed in a reforestation area of about 
      20 ha located in northern Sardinia (40 degrees 43'N, 9 degrees 22'E, 600 m a.s.l.). Symptoms 
      included chlorosis, reddish-brown discoloration of the whole crown or dieback 
      starting in the upper crown and progressing downward through the crown, and 
      necrotic bark tissues at root collar. Approximately 25% of the trees were 
      affected. In a first attempt, a Phytophthora species was consistently isolated 
      from the rhizosphere of 23 symptomatic trees, which included necrotic fine roots 
      using oak leaves as bait (4). Afterwards, it was also isolated from phloem 
      samples taken from the margins of fresh lesions at the stem base and upper roots 
      of affected trees using synthetic mucor agar medium (1). Isolation from soil 
      samples of six healthy pine trees randomly selected in the site did not yield any 
      Phytophthora isolate. On carrot agar (CA), Phytophthora colonies were stellate to 
      slightly radiate with limited aerial mycelium. Sporangia were obpiryform, 
      non-papillate, and non-caducous, measuring 46.9 to 51.2 x 29.1 to 32.6 mum (l:b 
      ratio 1.9). Hyphal swellings were formed in chains or clusters; chlamydospores 
      were not observed. These isolates had cardinal temperatures of <5 degrees C, 25 degrees C, and 
      35 degrees C, respectively. Their morphological and cultural features were typical of 
      Phytophthora cryptogea Pethybridge & Lafferty. They were heterothallic and 
      produced oogonia with amphyginous antheridia when paired with an A2 mating type 
      tester strain of P. cryptogea. This identity was corroborated by sequence 
      analysis of the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region of the rDNA. BLAST 
      searches showed 99% homology with sequences of P. cryptogea available in GenBank 
      (DQ479410 and HQ697245). The ITS sequence of a representative isolate (PH101) was 
      submitted to GenBank (Accession Nos. KC603895). The strain PH101 was stored in 
      the culture collection of the Department of Agriculture at the University of 
      Sassari. Pathogenicity of isolate PH101 was verified by inoculating five freshly 
      cut logs of radiata pine (1 m long and 15 cm diam.) with a 5-mm agar plug taken 
      from the margin of 4-day-old culture grown on CA (4). The plug was inserted in a 
      5-mm hole made through the bark with a cork borer. Five control logs were 
      inoculated with sterile CA. All logs were incubated in a growth chamber at 20 degrees C. 
      Phloem lesion sizes were assessed after 1 month and measured 9.7 +/- 5.5 cm(2) 
      (average +/- standard deviation). Control logs had no lesions. The pathogen was 
      re-isolated from the lesions, thus fulfilling Koch's postulates. P. cryptogea has 
      been previously reported in Australia, causing decline of radiata pine trees in 
      wet and flooded soils (2). To our knowledge, this is the first report of P. 
      cryptogea on P. radiata trees in Europe. References: (1) C. M. Brasier and S. A.

TI  - First Report of Meloidogyne javanica on Sacha Inchi (Plukenetia volubilis) in 
      China.
PG  - 165
LID - 10.1094/PDIS-03-13-0241-PDN [doi]
AB  - Sacha inchi (Plukenetia volubilis L.) is a plant native to the rain forest of the 
      Peruvian Amazon region. Because of its high protein and oil content as well as 
      general nutritional quality, it is regarded as a promising new crop. Successfully 
      introduced from South America in 2006, Sacha inchi has been cultivated in 
      Xishuangbanna, in the southwestern region of Yunnan Province, China. During an 
      investigation from August to October of 2012, severely stunted and withered Sacha 
      inchi plants with rotted and galled root were observed in fields. Dissection of 
      galled root tissue revealed mature root-knot nematode (Meloidogyne sp) females 
      with body cavity filled with red color contents. The population was extracted and 
      quantified from soil and root samples and identified to species by morphology, 
      esterase (EST) isozyme phenotypes, and molecular characterization (3). Mean 
      populations of 774 +/- 251 Meloidogyne second stage juveniles (J2) per 100 cm(3) of 
      soil were extracted from the rhizosphere of symptomatic plants. These juveniles 
      (n = 20) were characterized by length (410 to 480 mum) and hyaline tail terminus 
      length (11 to 17 mum). Females (n = 20) were characterized by stylet length (14.1 
      to 17.3 mum) and the perineal pattern (rounded with fine striae, low to moderately 
      high dorsal arch, and a distinct lateral field clearly demarcated from striae by 
      parallel lines). The distinct lateral lines of the perineal pattern are 
      diagnostic for this species (3). Gravid females were used for esterase (Est) 
      isoenzyme analysis, and showed the J3 phenotype (relative migration rate [Rm] = 
      1.0, 1.25, and 1.4), typical of M. javanica, a species-specific phenotype used to 
      differentiate this species from other members of Meloidogyne (1). Additionally, 
      three single egg masses associated with red body females were extracted from the 
      field-collected Sacha inchi roots and inoculated onto three potted tomato plants 
      (Solanum lycopersicum 'Rutgers') and maintained in the greenhouse for 8 weeks 
      until root galls and egg masses were visible. The observation of root-knot 
      nematodes from tomato roots showed that all females' bodies were normal white, 
      and the nematode species was also identified as M. javanica based on the esterase 
      phenotype and the perineal pattern. It is suggested that the red body contents 
      associated with females on Sacha inchi is the result of an unknown chemical 
      compound acquired from that host. Although undetermined to species, Meloidogyne 
      has been reported on Sacha inchi in Peru (2). To our knowledge, this is the first 
      detection of M. javanica on this plant. Since M. javanica is widely distributed 
      throughout the tropics, this root-knot nematode could be an important threat to 
      the commercial cultivation of Sacha inchi. References: (1) R. M. Carneiro et al.

TI  - Elevated root retention of hexahydro-1,3,5-trinitro-1,3,5-triazine (RDX) in 
      coniferous trees.
PG  - 3733-43
LID - 10.1007/s11356-013-2306-5 [doi]
AB  - For decades, the explosive RDX (hexahydro-1,3,5-trinitro-1,3,5-triazine) has been 
      used for military and industrial applications. Residues of RDX pollute soils in 
      large areas globally and the persistence and high soil mobility of these residues 
      can lead to leaching into groundwater. Dendroremediation, i.e. the long-term use 
      of trees to clean up polluted soils, is gaining acceptance as a green and 
      sustainable strategy. Although the coniferous tree species Norway spruce and 
      Scots pine cover large areas of military land in Central Europe, the potential of 
      any coniferous tree for dendroremediation of RDX is still unknown. In this study, 
      uptake experiments with a (14)C-labelled RDX solution (30 mg L(-1)) revealed that 
      RDX was predominantly retained in the roots of 6-year-old coniferous trees. Only 
      23 % (pine) to 34 % (spruce) of RDX equivalents (RDXeq) taken up by the roots 
      were translocated to aboveground tree compartments. This finding contrasts with 
      the high aerial accumulation of RDXeq (up to 95 %) in the mass balances of all 
      other plant species. Belowground retention of RDXeq is relatively stable in fine 
      root fractions, since water leaching from tissue homogenates was less than 5 %. 
      However, remobilisation from milled coarse roots and tree stubs reached up to 53 
      %. Leaching from homogenised aerial tree material was found to reach 64 % for 
      needles, 58 % for stems and twigs and 40 % for spring sprouts. Leaching of RDX by 
      precipitation increases the risk for undesired re-entry into the soil. However, 
      it also opens the opportunity for microbial mineralisation in the litter layer or 
      in the rhizosphere of coniferous forests and offers a chance for repeated uptake 
      of RDX by the tree roots.

      mass spectrometry (LA-ICPMS). The new high resolution mixed binding gel (HR-MBG) 
      is based on zirconium-hydroxide and suspended particulate reagent-iminodiacetate 
      (SPR-IDA) as resin materials which are embedded in an ether-based urethane 
      polymer hydrogel. The use of this polymer hydrogel material allows the production 
      of ultrathin, highly stable and tear-proof resin gel layers with superior 
      handling properties compared to existing ultrathin polyacrylamide gels. The gel 
      was characterized regarding its uptake kinetics, the anion and cation capacities, 
      and the effects of pH, ionic strength, and aging on the performance of the 
      HR-MBG. Our results demonstrate the capability of this novel gel for concomitant 
      sampling of anions and cations. The suitability of this new gel type for DGT 
      chemical imaging at submm spatial resolution in soils using LA-ICPMS is shown. 2D 
      images of P, As, Co, Cu, Mn, and Zn distributions around roots of Zea mays L. 
      demonstrate the new opportunities offered by the HR-MBG for high-resolution 
      mapping of solute dynamics in soil and sediment hotspots, such as the 
      rhizosphere, by simultaneous observation of anionic and cationic solute species.

TI  - [Isolation and identification of cultivable myxobacteria in the rhizosphere soils 
      of medicinal plants].
PG  - 657-68
AB  - OBJECTIVE: We isolated myxobacteria and explored their diversity from the 
      rhizosphere soils of some medicinal plants. METHODS: We used the helper bacteria 
      baiting technique to isolate myxobacteria from the rhizosphere soils collected in 
      South China Botanical Garden and Nanling National Forest Park. The myxobacteria 
      were identified by morphological characteristics and 16S rDNA gene sequences 
      analysis. RESULTS: A total of 50 strains were isolated from 22 soil samples, 
      which were identified into 7 genera, Myxococcus (18), Corallococcus (11), 
      Cystobacter (7), Archangium (8), Stigmatella (1), Chondromyces (4) and 
      Pyxidicoccus (1). The dominant genera were Myxococcus and Corallococcus. 
      CONCLUSION: Environmental factors were associated with the diversity of 
      myxobactria. Myxobacteria better adapt in high organic matter content and neutral 
      pH environments. The strains of Myxococcus and Corallococcus had a good 
      adaptability for different pH. Meanwhile, the dependence of the strains of 
      Myxococcus and Cystobacter on organic carbon content was not too obvious, and 
      they can also be found in the poor soils. Our findings provided an important 
      scientific base for the development and utilization of myxobacteria resources.

TI  - [Effects of precipitation variation on the distribution pattern of soil fungal 
      diversity in broad-leaved Korean pine mixed forest].
PG  - 1985-90
AB  - Broad-leaved Korean pine mixed forest is a kind of zonal climax vegetation with 
      ecological significance in Northeast China, whereas Changbai Mountain is an ideal 
      area to study the effects of precipitation variation on temperate forest. Taking 
      the virgin broad-leaved Korean pine mixed forest in Changbai Mountain as the 
      object, and based on T-RFLP method, this paper analyzed the spatial heterogeneity 
      of fungal diversity in 0-5 cm and 5-10 cm soil layers and in rhizosphere soil at 
      three different precipitation plots (30% increase, 30% decrease, and the 
      control). Both the increase and the decrease of precipitation increased the 
      diversity of soil fungi, but the dominant population changed. In 0-5 cm and 5-10 
      cm soil layers, the T-RFs over 500 bp increased with precipitation; in 
      rhizosphere soil, the T-RFs responded to precipitation variation were 380 bp, 455 
      bp, and 487 bp, and the response mode was more complicated than that in surface 
      soil layers. The results of CCA showed that the fungal community composition was 
      significantly affected by soil pH, organic carbon, total nitrogen, and organic 
      phosphorus.

AB  - A Gram-stain negative, rod-shaped, non-motile and pink-pigmented bacterial 
      strain, designated strain HYL7-26(T), was isolated from a soil in the Desert Park 
      of Huyang forest located in Xinjiang, China. Phylogenetic analysis based on 16S 
      rRNA gene sequences indicated that strain HYL7-26(T) belongs to the genus 
      Pontibacter in the family Cytophagaceae. The 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity 
      between strain HYL7-26(T) and type strains of Pontibacter species ranged from 
      93.2 to 96.0 %. Strain HYL7-26(T) was found to contain iso-C15:0 (15.9 %), 
      iso-C17:0 3-OH (9.5 %) and summed feature 4 (comprising anteiso-C17:1 B and/or 
      iso-C17:1 I, 21.0 %, as defined by the MIDI system) as the major cellular fatty 
      acids. The major respiratory quinone was identified as MK-7 and the DNA G+C 
      content was determined to be 43.8 mol%. sym-Homospermidine was the major 
      polyamine observed in the cells. On the basis of phenotypic, chemotaxonomic and 
      phylogenetic data, strain HYL7-26(T) is considered to represent a novel species 
      of the genus Pontibacter, for which the name Pontibacter soli sp. nov. is 
      proposed. The type strain is HYL7-26(T) (=CCTCC AB 206240(T) = NRRL B-59490(T)).

TI  - Biosafety and colonization of Burkholderia multivorans WS-FJ9 and its 
      growth-promoting effects on poplars.
PG  - 10489-98
LID - 10.1007/s00253-013-5276-0 [doi]
AB  - Burkholderia cepacia complex (Bcc) is a group of bacteria with conflicting 
      biological characteristics, which make them simultaneously beneficial and harmful 
      to humans. They have been exploited for biocontrol, bioremediation, and plant 
      growth promotion. However, their capacity as opportunistic bacteria that infect 
      humans restricts their biotechnological applications. Therefore, the risks of 
      using these bacteria should be assessed. In this study, Burkholderia multivorans 
      WS-FJ9 originally isolated from pine rhizosphere, which was shown to be efficient 
      in solubilizing phosphate, was evaluated with respect to its biosafety, 
      colonization in poplar rhizosphere, and growth-promoting effects on poplar 
      seedlings. Pathogenicity of B. multivorans WS-FJ9 on plants was determined 
      experimentally using onion and tobacco as model plants. Onion bulb inoculated 
      with B. multivorans WS-FJ9 showed slight hypersensitive responses around the 
      inoculation points, but effects were not detectable based on the inner color and 
      odor of the onion. Tobacco leaves inoculated with B. multivorans WS-FJ9 exhibited 
      slightly water-soaked spots around the inoculation points, which did not expand 
      or develop into lesions even with repeated incubation. Pathogenicity of the 
      strain in alfalfa, which has been suggested as an alternative Bcc model for mice, 
      was not detectable. Results from gene-specific polymerase chain reactions showed 
      that the tested B. multivorans WS-FJ9 strain did not possess the BCESM and cblA 
      virulence genes. Scanning electron microscopy revealed that the colonization of 
      the WS-FJ9 strain reached 1.4 x 10(4) colony forming units (cfu) g(-1) 
      rhizosphere soil on day 77 post-inoculation. The B. multivorans WS-FJ9 strain 
      could colonize the rhizosphere as well as the root tissues and cells of poplars. 
      Greenhouse evaluations in both sterilized and non-sterilized soils indicated that 
      B. multivorans WS-FJ9 significantly promoted growth in height, root collar 
      diameter, and plant biomass of inoculated poplar seedlings compared with 
      controls. Phosphorus contents of roots and stems of treated seedlings were 0.57 
      and 0.55 mg g(-1) higher than those of the controls, respectively. Phosphorus 
      content was lower in the rhizosphere soils by an average of 1.03 mg g(-1) 
      compared with controls. The results demonstrated that B. multivorans WS-FJ9 is a 
      nonpathogenic strain that could colonize the roots and significantly promote the 
      growth of poplar seedlings.

PG  - 1501-8
AB  - Rhizospheric and non-rhizospheric soils and the absorption, transition, and 
      storage roots were sampled from the mid-subtropical Pinus massoniana and 
      Castanopsis sclerophylla forests to study the CO2 fluxes from soil mineralization 
      and root decomposition in the forests. The samples were incubated in closed jars 
      at 15 degrees C, 25 degrees C, 35 degrees C, and 45 degrees C, respectively, and 
      alkali absorption method was applied to measure the CO2 fluxes during 53 days 
      incubation. For the two forests, the rhizospheric effect (ratio of rhizospheric 
      to non-rhizospheric soil) on the CO2 flux from soil mineralization across all 
      incubation temperature ranged from 1.12 to 3.09, with a decreasing trend along 
      incubation days. There was no significant difference in the CO2 flux from soil 
      mineralization between the two forests at 15 degrees C, but the CO2 flux was 
      significantly higher in P. massoniana forest than in C. sclerophylla forest at 25 
      degrees C and 35 degrees C, and in an opposite pattern at 45 degrees C. At all 
      incubation temperature, the CO2 release from the absorption root decomposition 
      was higher than that from the transition and storage roots decomposition, and was 
      smaller in P. massoniana than in C. sclerophylla forest for all the root 
      functional types. The Q10 values of the CO2 fluxes from the two forests were 
      higher for soils (1.21-1.83) than for roots (0.96-1.36). No significant 
      differences were observed in the Q10 values of the CO2 flux from soil 
      mineralization between the two forests, but the Q10 value of the CO2 flux from 
      root decomposition was significantly higher in P. massoniana than in C. 
      sclerophylla forest. It was suggested that the increment of CO2 flux from soil 
      mineralization under global warming was far higher than that from root 
      decomposition, and for P. massoniana than for C. sclerophylla forest. In 
      subtropics of China, the adaptability of zonal climax community to global warming 
      would be stronger than that of pioneer community.

AB  - Microbial biomass phosphorus (MBP) is one of the most active forms of phosphorus 
      (P) in soils. MBP plays an important role in the biogeochemical P cycle. To 
      explore MBP distribution and its relationship with other factors, the MBP and 
      rhizosphere soil P concentrations and fractions in six vegetation zones on the 
      eastern slope of Gongga Mountain in SW China were investigated. The MBP 
      distribution followed a parabolic pattern with altitude and the concentration was 
      highest in the subalpine dark coniferous forest (SDC) zone, which was 
      approximately 3500 m above sea level (asl). Below 3500 m asl, the MBP 
      distribution was controlled by precipitation and vegetation type. In addition, 
      temperature, precipitation and vegetation type controlled the MBP distribution at 
      elevations above 3500 m asl. No specific distribution pattern was determined 
      regarding rhizosphere soil P fractions. However, MBP was significantly correlated 
      with the unavailable P fraction in the rhizosphere rather than with the available 
      P fraction. This result suggests that the relationships between the rhizosphere 
      soil P fractions and the MBP depend on time. The microbial biomass element ratios 
      were relatively consistent on the eastern slope of Gongga Mountain. However, 
      variations in the microbial biomass element rations were observed in six of the 
      vegetation zones. The mean C:N:P ratio was 9.0ratio1.3ratio1. Overall, vegetation type 
      resulted in the observed fluctuations of the microbial biomass element ratio.

AB  - Morphological plasticity of ectomycorrhizal (EcM) short roots (known also as 
      first and second order roots with primary development) allows trees to adjust 
      their water and nutrient uptake to local environmental conditions. The 
      morphological traits (MTs) of short-living EcM roots, such as specific root 
      length (SRL) and area, root tip frequency per mass unit (RTF), root tissue 
      density, as well as mean diameter, length, and mass of the root tips, are good 
      indicators of acclimation. We investigated the role of EcM root morphological 
      plasticity across the climate gradient (48-68 degrees N) in Norway spruce (Picea abies 
      (L.) Karst) and (53-66 degrees N) birch (Betula pendula Roth., B. pubescens Ehrh.) 
      forests, as well as in primary and secondary successional birch forests assuming 
      higher plasticity of a respective root trait to reflect higher relevance of that 
      characteristic in acclimation process. We hypothesized that although the 
      morphological plasticity of EcM roots is subject to the abiotic and biotic 
      environmental conditions in the changing climate; the tools to achieve the 
      appropriate morphological acclimation are tree species-specific. Long-term 
      (1994-2010) measurements of EcM roots morphology strongly imply that tree species 
      have different acclimation-indicative root traits in response to changing 
      environments. Birch EcM roots acclimated along latitude by changing mostly SRL 
      [plasticity index (PI) = 0.60], while spruce EcM roots became adjusted by 
      modifying RTF (PI = 0.68). Silver birch as a pioneer species must have a broader 
      tolerance to environmental conditions across various environments; however, the 
      mean PI of all MTs did not differ between early-successional birch and 
      late-successional spruce. The differences between species in SRL, and RTF, 
      diameter, and length decreased southward, toward temperate forests with more 
      favorable growth conditions. EcM root traits reflected root-rhizosphere 
      succession across forest succession stages.

PG  - 1423-7
AB  - A root separation experiment was conducted to investigate the plant growth and 
      rhizosphere soil microbes and enzyme activities in a mulberry/soybean 
      intercropping system. As compared with those in plastic barrier and nylon mesh 
      barrier treatments, the plant height, leaf number, root length, root nodule 
      number, and root/shoot ratio of mulberry and soybean in non-barrier treatment 
      were significantly higher, and the soybean's effective nodule number was larger. 
      The available phosphorous content in the rhizosphere soils of mulberry and 
      soybean in no barrier and nylon mesh barrier treatments was increased by 10.3% 
      and 11.1%, and 5.1% and 4.6%, respectively, as compared with that in plastic 
      barrier treatment. The microbial number, microbial diversity, and enzyme 
      activities in the rhizosphere soils of mulberry and soybean were higher in the 
      treatments of no barrier and nylon mesh barrier than in the treatment of plastic 
      barrier. All the results indicated that there was an obvious interspecific 
      synergistic effect between mulberry and soybean in the mulberry/soybean 
      intercropping system.

TI  - Synthesis and modeling perspectives of rhizosphere priming.
PG  - 31-44
LID - 10.1111/nph.12440 [doi]
AB  - The rhizosphere priming effect (RPE) is a mechanism by which plants interact with 
      soil functions. The large impact of the RPE on soil organic matter decomposition 
      rates (from 50% reduction to 380% increase) warrants similar attention to that 
      being paid to climatic controls on ecosystem functions. Furthermore, global 
      increases in atmospheric CO2 concentration and surface temperature can 
      significantly alter the RPE. Our analysis using a game theoretic model suggests 
      that the RPE may have resulted from an evolutionarily stable mutualistic 
      association between plants and rhizosphere microbes. Through model simulations 
      based on microbial physiology, we demonstrate that a shift in microbial metabolic 
      response to different substrate inputs from plants is a plausible mechanism 
      leading to positive or negative RPEs. In a case study of the Duke Free-Air CO2 
      Enrichment experiment, performance of the PhotoCent model was significantly 
      improved by including an RPE-induced 40% increase in soil organic matter 
      decomposition rate for the elevated CO2 treatment--demonstrating the value of 
      incorporating the RPE into future ecosystem models. Overall, the RPE is emerging 
      as a crucial mechanism in terrestrial ecosystems, which awaits substantial 
      research and model development.

      species.
PG  - 657-74
LID - 10.1007/s10482-013-9975-4 [doi]
AB  - The diversity of Trichoderma (Hypocreales, Ascomycota) colonizing leaf litter as 
      well as the rhizosphere of Garcinia macrophylla (Clusiaceae) was investigated in 
      primary and secondary rain forests in Colombian Amazonia. DNA barcoding of 107 
      strains based on the internal transcribed spacers 1 and 2 (ITS1 and 2) of the 
      ribosomal RNA gene cluster and the partial sequence of the translation elongation 
      factor 1 alpha (tef1) gene revealed that the diversity of Trichoderma was 
      dominated (71 %) by three common cosmopolitan species, namely Trichoderma 
      harzianum sensu lato (41 %), Trichoderma spirale (17 %) and Trichoderma 
      koningiopsis (13 %). Four ITS 1 and 2 phylotypes (13 strains) could not be 
      identified with certainty. Multigene phylogenetic analysis and phenotype 
      profiling of four strains with an ITS1 and 2 phylotype similar to Trichoderma 
      strigosum revealed a new sister species of the latter that is described here as 
      Trichoderma strigosellum sp. nov. Sequence similarity searches revealed that this 
      species also occurs in soils of Malaysia and Cameroon, suggesting a pantropical 
      distribution.

TI  - Growth inhibition of an Araucaria angustifolia (Coniferopsida) fungal seed 
      pathogen, Neofusicoccum parvum, by soil streptomycetes.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Araucariaceae are important forest trees of the southern hemisphere. 
      Life expectancy of their seedlings can largely be reduced by fungal infections. 
      In this study we have isolated and characterized such a fungus and investigated 
      the potential of Streptomyces Actinobacteria from the respective rhizosphere to 
      act as antagonists. RESULTS: The pathogenic fungus from Araucaria angustifolia 
      seeds was identified by morphological markers (pore-associated Woronin-bodies) as 
      belonging to the Pezizomycotina. Molecular data identified the fungus as 
      Neofusicoccum parvum (Botryosphaeriaceae). Co-cultures on agar of this fungus 
      with certain streptomycete isolates from the rhizosphere, and from the surface of 
      Araucaria roots significantly reduced the growth of the fungus. HPLC analysis of 
      the agar yielded streptomycete-specific exudate compounds which were partly 
      identified. There were differences in compounds between single (bacteria, fungus) 
      and dual cultures (bacteria + fungus). CONCLUSION: Streptomycetes from the 
      rhizosphere of Araucariaceae produce exudates which can suppress the development 
      of pathogenic fungi in their seeds.

TI  - Induction of biofilm formation in the betaproteobacterium Burkholderia unamae 
      CK43B exposed to exogenous indole and gallic acid.
PG  - 4845-52
LID - 10.1128/AEM.01209-13 [doi]
AB  - Burkholderia unamae CK43B, a member of the Betaproteobacteria that was isolated 
      from the rhizosphere of a Shorea balangeran sapling in a tropical peat swamp 
      forest, produces neither indole nor extracellular polymeric substances associated 
      with biofilm formation. When cultured in a modified Winogradsky's medium 
      supplemented with up to 1.7 mM indole, B. unamae CK43B maintains its planktonic 
      state by cell swelling and effectively degrades exogenous indole. However, in 
      medium supplemented with 1.7 mM exogenous indole and 1.0 mM gallic acid, B. 
      unamae CK43B produced extracellular polymeric substances and formed a biofilm. 
      The concentration indicated above of gallic acid alone had no effect on either 
      the growth or the differentiation of B. unamae CK43B cells above a certain 
      concentration threshold, whereas it inhibited indole degradation by B. unamae 
      CK43B to 3-hydroxyindoxyl. In addition, coculture of B. unamae CK43B with 
      indole-producing Escherichia coli in nutrient-rich Luria-Bertani medium 
      supplemented with 1.0 mM gallic acid led to the formation of mixed cell 
      aggregates. The viability and active growth of B. unamae CK43B cells in a 
      coculture system with Escherichia coli were evidenced by fluorescence in situ 
      hybridization. Our data thus suggest that indole facilitates intergenus 
      communication between indole-producing gammaproteobacteria and some 
      indole-degrading bacteria, particularly in gallic acid-rich environments.

AB  - A number of soil microorganisms can convert insoluble forms of phosphorus (P) to 
      an accessible form to increase plant yields. Phytate is such a large kind of 
      insoluble organic phosphorus that plants cannot absorb directly in soil, so the 
      objectives of this study were to isolate, screen phytate-degrading rhizobacteria 
      (PDRB), and to select potential microbial inocula that could increase the P 
      uptake by plants. In this study, a total of 24 soil samples were collected from 
      natural habitats of eight poplar and pine planting areas from the eastern to 
      southern China. 17 PDRB strains were preliminarily screened from the rhizosphere 
      soil of poplars and pines by the visible decolorization in the phytate selective 
      medium. The highest ratio of the total diameter (colony + halo zone) to the 
      colony diameter of the isolates was JZ-GX1, 3.85. Afterward, 17 PDRB strains were 
      further determined for their abilities to degrade sodium phytate based on the 
      amount of liberated inorganic P in liquid phytate specific medium. The results 
      showed that the phytase ability of the three highest PDRB strains: JZ-GX1, JZ-DZ1 
      and JZ-ZJ1 were up to 2.58, 2.36 and 2.24 U/mL, respectively, much better than 
      most of the bacteria reported in previous studies. In the soil-plant experiment, 
      compared to CK, the best three strains of PDRB all could significantly promote 
      growth of poplar and Masson pine under container growing. The three efficient 
      PDRB strains were identified as follow: JZ-GX1, Rahnella aquatilis, both JZ-DZ1 
      and JZ-ZJ1 being autofluorescent, Pseudomonas fluorescens, by 16S rDNA gene 
      sequencing technology, Biolog Identification System and biological 
      characterization. The present study suggests that the three screened PDRB strains 
      would have great potential application as biological fertilizers in the future.

AB  - The microbial community plays an essential role in the high productivity in 
      mangrove wetlands. A proper understanding of the spatial variations of microbial 
      communities will provide clues about the underline mechanisms that structure 
      microbial groups and the isolation of bacterial strains of interest. In the 
      present study, the diversity and composition of the bacterial community in 
      sediments collected from four locations, namely mudflat, edge, bulk, and 
      rhizosphere, within the Mai Po Ramsar Wetland in Hong Kong, SAR, China were 
      compared using the barcoded Illumina paired-end sequencing technique. Rarefaction 
      results showed that the bulk sediment inside the mature mangrove forest had the 
      highest bacterial alpha-diversity, while the mudflat sediment without vegetation had 
      the lowest. The comparison of beta-diversity using principal component analysis and 
      principal coordinate analysis with UniFrac metrics both showed that the spatial 
      effects on bacterial communities were significant. All sediment samples could be 
      clustered into two major groups, inner (bulk and rhizosphere sediments collected 
      inside the mangrove forest) and outer mangrove sediments (the sediments collected 
      at the mudflat and the edge of the mangrove forest). With the linear discriminate 
      analysis scores larger than 3, four phyla, namely Actinobacteria, Acidobacteria, 
      Nitrospirae, and Verrucomicrobia, were enriched in the nutrient-rich inner 
      mangrove sediments, while abundances of Proteobacteria and Deferribacterias were 
      higher in outer mangrove sediments. The rhizosphere effect of mangrove plants was 
      also significant, which had a lower alpha-diversity, a higher amount of Nitrospirae, 
      and a lower abundance of Proteobacteria than the bulk sediment nearby.

AB  - Monoculture causes nutrient losses and leads to declines in soil fertility and 
      biomass production over successive cultivation. The rhizosphere, a zone of 
      usually high microbial activities and clearly distinct from bulk soil, is defined 
      as the volume of soil around living roots and influenced by root activities. Here 
      we investigated enzyme activities and microbial biomass in the rhizosphere under 
      different tree compositions. Six treatments with poplar, willow, and alder mono- 
      or mixed seedlings were grown in rhizoboxes. Enzyme activities associated with 
      nitrogen cycling and microbial biomass were measured in all rhizosphere and bulk 
      soils. Both enzyme activities and microbial biomass in the rhizosphere differed 
      significantly tree compositions. Microbial biomass contents were more sensitive 
      to the changes of the rhizosphere environment than enzyme activities. Tree 
      species coexistence did not consistently increase tested enzyme activities and 
      microbial biomass, but varied depending on the complementarities of species 
      traits. In general, impacts of tree species and coexistence were more pronounced 
      on microbial composition than total biomass, evidenced by differences in 
      microbial biomass C/N ratios stratified across the rhizosphere soils. Compared to 
      poplar clone monoculture, other tree species addition obviously increased 
      rhizosphere urease activity, but greatly reduced rhizosphere L-asparaginase 
      activity. Poplar growth was enhanced only when coexisted with alder. Our results 
      suggested that a highly productive or keystone plant species in a community had 
      greater influence over soil functions than the contribution of diversity.

AB  - Mineral amendment (i.e. calcium, phosphorous, potassium and/or magnesium) is a 
      management practice used in forestry to improve nutrient availability and recover 
      soil fertility, especially in nutrient-poor forest ecosystems. However, whether 
      this amendment can lead to modifications of the soil characteristics and an 
      improvement in tree growth, and its impact on the soil bacterial communities, 
      especially the mineral weathering bacterial communities, remains poorly 
      documented. In this study, we investigated the short-term impact of a mineral 
      amendment on the taxonomic and functional structure of the mineral weathering 
      bacterial communities. To do this, a plantation of four-year old oak (Quercus 
      petraea) trees amended with or without dolomite [CaMg(CO3)2] was established in 
      the experimental forest site of Breuil-Chenue, which is characterized by an 
      acidic soil and a low availability of calcium and magnesium. Three years after 
      amendment, soil samples were used to isolate bacteria as well as to determine the 
      soil characteristics and the metabolic potentials of these soil microbial 
      communities. Based on a bioassay for quantifying the solubilisation of inorganic 
      phosphorous, we demonstrate that the bacterial isolates coming from the 
      non-amended bulk soil were significantly more efficient than those from the 
      amended bulk soil. No difference was observed between the bacterial isolates 
      coming from the amended and non-amended rhizospheres. Notably, the taxonomic 
      analyses revealed a dominance of bacterial isolates belonging to the Burkholderia 
      genus in both samples. Overall, our results suggest that the bioavailability of 
      nutritive cations into soil impacts the distribution and the efficacy of mineral 
      weathering bacterial communities coming from the soil but not those coming from 
      the rhizosphere.

TI  - Copper, zinc, and cadmium in various fractions of soil and fungi in a Swedish 
      forest.

AB  - Ectomycorrhizal fungi profoundly affect forest ecosystems through mediating 
      nutrient uptake and maintaining forest food webs. The accumulation of metals in 
      each transfer step from bulk soil to fungal sporocarps is not well known. The 
      accumulation of three metals copper (Cu), zinc (Zn) and cadmium (Cd) in bulk 
      soil, rhizosphere, soil-root interface, fungal mycelium and sporocarps of 
      mycorrhizal fungi in a Swedish forest were compared. Concentrations of all three 
      metals increased in the order: bulk soil < soil-root interface (or rhizosphere) < 
      fungal mycelium < fungal sporocarps. The uptake of Cu, Zn and Cd during the 
      entire transfer process in natural conditions between soil and sporocarps 
      occurred against a concentration gradient. In fungal mycelium, the concentration 
      of all three metals was about three times higher than in bulk soil, and the 
      concentration in sporocarps was about two times higher than in mycelium. In terms 
      of accumulation, fungi (mycelium and sporocarps) preferred Cd to Zn and Cu. Zinc 
      concentration in sporocarps and to a lesser extent in mycelium depended on the 
      concentration in soil, whereas, the uptake of Cu and Cd by both sporocarps and 
      mycelium did not correlate with metal concentration in soil. Heavy metal 
      accumulation within the fungal mycelium biomass in the top forest soil layer (0-5 
      cm) might account for ca. 5-9% of the total amount of Cu, 5-11% of Zn, and 16-32% 
      of Cd. As the uptake of zinc and copper by fungi may be balanced, this implied 
      similarities in the uptake mechanism.

TI  - [Effects of Festuca arundinacea on the microbial community in crude 
      oil-contaminated saline-alkaline soil].
PG  - 3414-20
AB  - By using the routine soil physical and chemical analysis methods and the Biolog 
      technique, this paper studied the effects of Festuca arundinacea growth on the pH 
      value, total salt content, and microbial community in the rhizosphere of crude 
      dil-contaminated saline-alkaline soil in Songnen Plain of Northeast China. Crude 
      oil contamination resulted in the increases of average well color development 
      (AWCD), Shannon index (H), and carbon source utilization richness index (S), and 
      altered the utilization patterns of carbon sources by the microbes. F. 
      arundinacea had greater potential to remediate crude oil-contaminated soil. This 
      plant could decrease the soil pH and soil total petroleum hydrocarbon (TPH) 
      content, and increase the soil water content. The AWCD and S in F. arundinacea 
      rhizosphere soil were obviously higher than those in the soil of naked land, 
      providing a suitable environment for the growth and development of rhizosphere 
      soil microbes.

TI  - Root and arbuscular mycorrhizal mycelial interactions with soil microorganisms in 
      lowland tropical forest.
PG  - 37-50
LID - 10.1111/1574-6941.12096 [doi]
AB  - Tropical forests have high rates of soil carbon cycling, but little information 
      is available on how roots, arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF), and free-living 
      microorganisms interact and influence organic matter mineralization in these 
      ecosystems. We used mesh ingrowth cores and isotopic tracers in phospholipid 
      fatty acid biomarkers to investigate the effects of roots and AMF mycelia on (1) 
      microbial community composition, microbial carbon utilization, and hydrolytic 
      enzyme activities for large, potted tropical trees and (2) enzyme activities and 
      litter mass loss in a lowland tropical forest. Under the tropical tree, 
      plant-derived carbon was incorporated predominantly into bacterial groups in both 
      rhizosphere and AMF-only soils. Gram-positive bacteria incorporated additional 
      soil-derived carbon in rhizosphere soils, which also contained the highest 
      microbial biomass. For hydrolytic enzymes, beta-glucosidase and N-acetyl 
      beta-glucosaminidase activities were highest in rhizosphere soils, while 
      phosphomonoesterase activity was highest in AMF-only soil. In the forest, leaf 
      litter mass loss was increased by the presence of roots, but not by the presence 
      of AMF mycelia only. Root-microbial interactions influenced organic matter 
      cycling, with evidence for rhizosphere priming and accelerated leaf litter 
      decomposition in the presence of roots. Although AMF mycelia alone did not 
      stimulate organic matter mineralization, they were a conduit of carbon to other 
      soil microorganisms.

TI  - Effects of elevated CO(2) and Pb on the microbial community in the rhizosphere of 
      Pinus densiflora.
PG  - 895-901
LID - 10.1007/s12275-012-2207-1 [doi]
AB  - Rising levels of atmospheric CO(2) may stimulate forest productivity in the 
      future, resulting in increased carbon storage in terrestrial ecosystems. However, 
      heavy metal contamination may interfere with this, though the response is not yet 
      known. In this study, we investigated the effect of elevated CO(2) and Pb 
      contamination on microorganisms and decomposition in pine tree forest soil. 
      Three-year old pine trees (Pinus densiflora) were planted in Pb contaminated 
      soils (500 mg/kg-soil) and uncontaminated soils and cultivated for three months 
      in a growth chamber where the CO(2) concentration was controlled at 380 or 760 
      mg/kg. Structures of the microbial community were comparatively analyzed in bulk 
      and in rhizosphere soil samples using community-level physiological profiling 
      (CLPP) and 16S rRNA gene PCR-DGGE (denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis). 
      Additionally, microbial activity in rhizospheric soil, growth and the C/N ratio 
      of the pine trees were measured. Elevated CO(2) significantly increased microbial 
      activities and diversity in Pb contaminated soils due to the increase in carbon 
      sources, and this increase was more distinctive in rhizospheric soil than in bulk 
      soils. In addition, increased plant growth and C/N ratios of pine needles at 
      elevated CO(2) resulted in an increase in cation exchange capacity (CEC) and 
      dissolved organic carbon (DOC) of the rhizosphere in Pb contaminated soil. Taken 
      together, these findings indicate that elevated CO(2) levels and heavy metals can 
      affect the soil carbon cycle by changing the microbial community and plant 
      metabolism.

AB  - The bacterial community structure of the rhizosphere and non-rhizosphere soil of 
      Pinus patula, found in the Nilgiris region of Western Ghats, was studied by 
      constructing 16S rRNA gene clone libraries. In the rhizosphere and 
      non-rhizosphere soil clone libraries constructed, 13 and 15 bacterial phyla were 
      identified, respectively. The clone libraries showed the predominance of members 
      of culturally underrepresented phyla like Acidobacteria and Verrucomicrobia. The 
      Alphaproteobacteria and Acidobacteria clones were predominant in rhizosphere and 
      non-rhizosphere soil samples, respectively. In rhizosphere, amongst 
      Alphaproteobacteria members, Bradyrhizobium formed the significant proportion, 
      whereas in non-rhizosphere, members of subdivision-6 of phylum Acidobacteria were 
      abundant. The diversity analysis of P. patula soil libraries showed that the 
      phylotypes (16S rRNA gene similarity cutoff, >/=97 %) of Acidobacteria and 
      Bacteroidetes were relatively predominant and diverse followed by 
      Alphaproteobacteria and Verrucomicrobia. The diversity indices estimated higher 
      richness and abundance of bacteria in P. patula soil clone libraries than the 
      pine forest clone libraries retrieved from previous studies. The tools like 
      principal co-ordinate analysis and Jackknife cluster analysis, which were under 
      UniFrac analysis indicated that variations in soil bacterial communities were 
      attributed to their respective geographical locations due to the phylogenetic 
      divergence amongst the clone libraries. Overall, the P. patula rhizosphere and 
      non-rhizosphere clone libraries were found significantly unique in composition, 
      evenly distributed and highly rich in phylotypes, amongst the biogeographically 
      distant clone libraries. It was finally hypothesised that the phylogenetic 
      divergence amongst the bacterial phylotypes and natural selection plays a pivotal 
      role in the variations of bacterial communities across the geographical distance.

AB  - Responses of Collembola to 7 years of CO(2) enrichment (550 ppm) in a Swiss 
      free-air CO(2) enrichment (FACE) experiment in a forest with 80- to 120-year-old 
      trees were investigated in this study. Contrary to our expectations, increased 
      CO(2) caused a significant decrease in Collembola numbers, including a 
      significant decrease in euedaphic Collembola. Increased CO(2), however, did not 
      affect community group richness. Collembola biomass was not significantly changed 
      by CO(2) enrichment, regardless of whether it was considered in terms of the 
      total community, life-strategy groups, or individual species (with an exception 
      of Mesaphorura krausbaueri). The reason for this is that CO(2) enrichment caused 
      a general increase in individual body size, which compensated for reduced 
      abundances. The results are consistent with the idea that the rhizosphere is 
      important for soil fauna, and the combination of reduced fine root growth and 
      increased soil moisture might trigger a reduction in Collembola abundance.

TI  - [Characteristics of soil microbial community structure in Cunninghamia lanceolata 
      plantation].
PG  - 2135-40
AB  - By using dilution plate, fumigation extraction, and phospholipid fatty acid 
      (PLFA) methods, this paper studied the quantities of soil microbial populations 
      and the characteristics of soil microbial community structure in a Chinese fir 
      (Cunninghamia lanceolata) plantation converted from an evergreen broadleaved 
      forest. The results showed that, during the vegetation change from evergreen 
      broadleaved forest to Chinese fir plantation, the microbial biomass carbon and 
      the quantities of culturable bacteria and actinomyces were decreased. The total 
      PLFAs, bacterial PLFAs, and fungi PLFAs in the woodland soil from Chinese fir 
      plantation were decreased by 49.4%, 52.4%, 46.6%, simultaneously. And G+ and G- 
      bacterial PLFAs in Chinese fir plantation were lower than in evergreen 
      broadleaved forest. As compared with those in rhizosphere soil from Chinese fir 
      plantation, the microbial biomass carbon and the quantities of culturable 
      bacteria and actinomyces in bulk soil were decreased. The total PLFAs, bacterial 
      PLFAs, and G+ and G- bacterial PLFAs in the rhizosphere soil were increased, 
      while the ratio of fungal to bacterial PLFAs was lowered. The principal component 
      analysis of the soil microbial community structure indicated that the first 
      principal component (PC1) and the second principal component (PC2) together 
      accounted for 78.2% of total variation of soil microbial community structure. 
      This study showed there were some differences in the soil microbial community 
      structure between evergreen broadleaved forest and Chinese fir plantation.

TI  - Characterization of Al-responsive citrate excretion and citrate-transporting 
      MATEs in Eucalyptus camaldulensis.
PG  - 979-89
LID - 10.1007/s00425-012-1810-z [doi]
AB  - Many plant species excrete organic acids into the rhizosphere in response to 
      aluminum stress to protect sensitive cells from aluminum rhizotoxicity. When the 
      roots of Eucalyptus camaldulensis, a major source of pulp production, were 
      incubated in aluminum-toxic medium, citrate released into the solution increased 
      as a function of time. Citrate excretion was inducible by aluminum, but not by 
      copper or sodium chloride stresses. This indicated that citrate is the major 
      responsive organic acid released from the roots of this plant species to protect 
      the root tips from aluminum damage. Four genes highly homologs to known 
      citrate-transporting multidrugs and toxic compounds exclusion proteins, named 
      EcMATE1-4, were isolated using polymerase chain reaction-based cloning 
      techniques. Their predicted proteins included 12 membrane spanning domains, a 
      common structural feature of citrate-transporting MATE proteins, and consisted of 
      502-579 amino acids with >60 % homology to orthologous genes in other plant 
      species. One of the homologs, designated EcMATE1, was expressed in the roots more 
      abundantly than in the shoots and in response to both Al and low pH stresses. 
      Ectopic expression of EcMATE1 and 3 in tobacco hairy roots enhanced Al-responsive 
      citrate excretion. Pharmacological characterization indicated that Al-responsive 
      citrate excretion involved a protein phosphorylation/dephosphorylation process. 
      These results indicate that citrate excretion through citrate-transporting 
      multidrugs and toxic compounds exclusion proteins is one of the important 
      aluminum-tolerance mechanisms in Eucalyptus camaldulensis.

TI  - Shifts of functional gene representation in wheat rhizosphere microbial 
      communities under elevated ozone.
PG  - 660-71
LID - 10.1038/ismej.2012.120 [doi]
AB  - Although the influence of ozone (O(3)) on plants has been well studied in 
      agroecosystems, little is known about the effect of elevated O(3) (eO(3)) on soil 
      microbial functional communities. Here, we used a comprehensive functional gene 
      array (GeoChip 3.0) to investigate the functional composition, and structure of 
      rhizosphere microbial communities of Yannong 19 (O(3)-sensitive) and Yangmai 16 
      (O(3)-relatively sensitive) wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) cultivars under eO(3). 
      Compared with ambient O(3) (aO(3)), eO(3) led to an increase in soil pH and total 
      carbon (C) percentages in grain and straw of wheat plants, and reduced grain 
      weight and soil dissolved organic carbon (DOC). Based on GeoChip hybridization 
      signal intensities, although the overall functional structure of rhizosphere 
      microbial communities did not significantly change by eO(3) or cultivars, the 
      results showed that the abundance of specific functional genes involved in C 
      fixation and degradation, nitrogen (N) fixation, and sulfite reduction did 
      significantly (P<0.05) alter in response to eO(3) and/or wheat cultivars. Also, 
      Yannong 19 appeared to harbor microbial functional communities in the rhizosphere 
      more sensitive in response to eO(3) than Yangmai 16. Additionally, canonical 
      correspondence analysis suggested that the functional structure of microbial 
      community involved in C cycling was largely shaped by soil and plant properties 
      including pH, DOC, microbial biomass C, C/N ratio and grain weight. This study 
      provides new insight into our understanding of the influence of eO(3) and wheat 
      cultivars on soil microbial communities.

TI  - Species mixing boosts root yield in mangrove trees.
PG  - 271-8
LID - 10.1007/s00442-012-2490-x [doi]
AB  - Enhanced species richness can stimulate the productivity of plant communities; 
      however, its effect on the belowground production of forests has scarcely been 
      tested, despite the role of tree roots in carbon storage and ecosystem processes. 
      Therefore, we tested for the effects of tree species richness on mangrove root 
      biomass: thirty-two 6 m by 6 m plots were planted with zero (control), one, two 
      or three species treatments of six-month-old Avicennia marina (A), Bruguiera 
      gymnorrhiza (B) and Ceriops tagal (C). A monoculture of each species and the four 
      possible combinations of the three species were used, with four replicate plots 
      per treatment. Above- and belowground biomass was measured after three and four 
      years' growth. In both years, the all-species mix (ABC) had significant 
      overyielding of roots, suggesting complementarity mediated by differences in 
      rhizosphere use amongst species. In year four, there was higher belowground than 
      aboveground biomass in all but one treatment. Belowground biomass was strongly 
      influenced by the presence of the most vigorously growing species, A. marina. 
      These results demonstrate the potential for complementarity between fast- and 
      slow-growing species to enhance belowground growth in mangrove forests, with 
      implications for forest productivity and the potential for belowground carbon 
      sequestration.

      Amazon forest soils.
PG  - 607-21
LID - 10.1111/1574-6941.12018 [doi]
AB  - This study focused on the impact of land-use changes and agricultural management 
      of soybean in Amazon forest soils on the abundance and composition of the 
      acidobacterial community. Quantitative real-time PCR (q-PCR) assays and 
      pyrosequencing of 16S rRNA gene were applied to study the acidobacterial 
      community in bulk soil samples from soybean croplands and adjacent native 
      forests, and mesocosm soil samples from soybean rhizosphere. Based on qPCR 
      measurements, Acidobacteria accounted for 23% in forest soils, 18% in cropland 
      soils, and 14% in soybean rhizosphere of the total bacterial signals. From the 
      16S rRNA gene sequences of Bacteria domain, the phylum Acidobacteria represented 
      28% of the sequences from forest soils, 16% from cropland soils, and 17% from 
      soybean rhizosphere. Acidobacteria subgroups 1-8, 10, 11, 13, 17, 18, 22, and 25 
      were detected with subgroup 1 as dominant among them. Subgroups 4, 6, and 7 were 
      significantly higher in cropland soils than in forest soils, which subgroups 
      responded to decrease in soil aluminum. Subgroups 6 and 7 responded to high 
      content of soil Ca, Mg, Mn, and B. These results showed a differential response 
      of the Acidobacteria subgroups to abiotic soil factors, and open the 
      possibilities to explore acidobacterial subgroups as early-warning bioindicators 
      of agricultural soil management effects in the Amazon area.

TI  - Stable-isotope labeling and probing of recent photosynthates into respired CO2,

      technique on Sitka spruce (Picea sitchensis).
PG  - 2493-501

AB  - RATIONALE: Here we report on the successful application of a novel stem-injection 
      stable-isotope-labeling and probing technique in mature trees to trace the 
      spatial and temporal distribution of rhizosphere carbon belowground. METHODS: 
      Three 22-year-old Sitka spruce trees were injected with 6.66 g of (13)C-labeled 
      aspartic acid. Over the succeeding 30 days, soil CO(2) efflux, phospholipid 
      fatty-acid (PLFA) microbial biomarkers and soil invertebrates (mites, 
      collembolans and enchytraeids) were analyzed along a 50 m transect from each tree 
      to determine the temporal and spatial patterns in the translocation of recently 
      fixed photosynthates belowground. RESULTS: Soil delta(13)CO(2) values peaked 13-23 
      days after injection, up to 5 m from the base of the injected tree and was, on 
      average, 3.5 per thousand enriched in (13)C relative to the baseline. Fungal PLFA biomarkers 
      peaked 2-4 days after stem-injection, up to 20 m from the base of the injected 
      tree and were (13)C-enriched by up to 50 per thousand. Significant (13)C enrichment in mites 
      and enchytraeids occurred 4-6 days after injection (by, on average, 1.5 per thousand). 
      CONCLUSIONS: Stem injection of large trees with (13)C-enriched compounds is a 
      successful tool to trace C-translocation belowground. In particular, the 
      significant (13)C enrichment of CO(2) and enchytraeids near the base of the tree 
      and the significant (13)C enrichment of PLFAs up to 20 m away indicate that 
      mature Sitka spruce (Picea sitchensis) have the capacity to support soil 
      communities over large distances.

AB  - As phytoextraction implementation may be limited by metal toxicity and leaching, 
      we investigated the idea of in situ metal immobilization in bulk soil, while 
      increasing metal bioavailability in the rhizosphere. Salix smithiana was grown in 
      a pot experiment on two Cd/Zn polluted soils. Treatments with or without willows 
      included: no additives; gravel sludge + red mud kg(-1); acidification with S to 
      pH 3.5; and metal immobilization combined with soil acidification. Salix 
      smithiana removed up to 0.78 +/- 0.06% total Cd and 0.34% (+/-0.02) total Zn from the 
      non-treated soils. The phytoextraction efficiency in the S treatments was 
      enhanced by up to ~50% in response to metal solubility that was magnified by 
      reductive co-dissolution from Mn (IV) and Fe(III) (oxy)hydroxides during 
      microbial S oxidation in the willow rhizosphere. The proposed technique proved to 
      enhance phytoextraction efficiency while controlling the risk of metal leaching 
      from the root zone and phytotoxicity.

AB  - Acetochlor is a widely used herbicide in maize fields; however, the ecological 
      risk of its residue in the soil-plant system remains unknown. We investigated the 
      dissipation dynamics of field dose acetochlor and clarified its impact on 
      microbial biomass and community structure both in the rhizosphere and bulk soil 
      over 1 month after its application. Soil microbial parameters such as quantities 
      of culturable bacteria and fungi represented by colony-forming units, soil 
      microbial biomass carbon (SMB(C)), and phospholipid fatty acids (PLFAs) were 
      determined across different sampling times. The results showed that the 
      dissipation half-lives of acetochlor were, respectively, 2.8 and 3.4 days in the 
      rhizosphere and bulk soil, and 0.02-0.07 mug/g residual acetochlor could be 
      detected in the soil 40 days after its application. Compared to the bulk soil, 
      microbial communities in the rhizosphere soil were inclined to be affected by the 
      application of acetochlor: SMB(C) content and bacterial growth were most likely 
      to be increased; however, fungal growth was prone to be inhibited. The principal 
      component analysis of PLFAs, as well as the comparisons of fungi/bacteria and 
      cy17:0/C16:1omega9c ratios between different treatments over sampling time, revealed 
      that the soil microbial community composition was significantly affected by 
      acetochlor at its early application stage (at day 15); thereafter, the effects of 
      acetochlor were attenuated or even could not be detected. Our results suggested 
      that residual acetochlor did not confer a long-term impairment on viable 
      bacterial groups in the rhizosphere and bulk soil.

TI  - Production of phytohormones, siderophores and population fluctuation of two 
      root-promoting rhizobacteria in Eucalyptus globulus cuttings.
PG  - 2003-14
LID - 10.1007/s11274-012-1003-8 [doi]
AB  - Vegetative propagation by stem cuttings and mini-cuttings has been used worldwide 
      for growing Eucalyptus plants. However, clones and hybrids of this plant present 
      a great variability in their rooting capacity, apart from a gradual decrease in 
      the rooting potential due to the ontogenetic age of the mother plant. Several 
      studies have demonstrated that some bacteria promote plant growth and rooting 
      through the action of direct and indirect mechanisms that are not still 
      completely clear. Considering this, the objective of this study was to assess the 
      production of auxins, abscisic acid and siderophores in Bacillus subtilis and 
      Stenotrophomona maltophilia, which in previous studies increased rooting of E. 
      globulus cuttings. Additionally, the population of these bacteria in the 
      rhizosphere, superficial tissues of the stem-base and callus of the mini-cuttings 
      was identified, and quantified by real-time PCR. Only S. maltophilia produced IAA 
      in the presence of tryptophan; none of the bacterial strains produced ABA, but 
      both produced siderophores. A comparative analysis of the separation profiles 
      showed that there is a diverse microbial community in the rhizosphere, and only 
      S. maltophilia was capable of keeping its population at a density of 2.03 x 10(7) 
      cells/mg in different tissues of the mini-cuttings. The results would indicate 
      that the rooting stimulus in E. globulus could be related to the action of one or 
      several mechanisms such as the production of auxins and siderophores, and it 
      could also be associated with the ability of bacteria to stay in the rhizosphere 
      or in plant callus tissues.

TI  - Distinctive bacterial communities in the rhizoplane of four tropical tree 
      species.
PG  - 1018-27
LID - 10.1007/s00248-012-0082-2 [doi]
AB  - It is known that the microbial community of the rhizosphere is not only 
      influenced by factors such as root exudates, phenology, and nutrient uptake but 
      also by the plant species. However, studies of bacterial communities associated 
      with tropical rainforest tree root surfaces, or rhizoplane, are lacking. Here, we 
      analyzed the bacterial community of root surfaces of four species of native 
      trees, Agathis borneensis, Dipterocarpus kerrii, Dyera costulata, and Gnetum 
      gnemon, and nearby bulk soils, in a rainforest arboretum in Malaysia, using 454 
      pyrosequencing of the 16S rRNA gene. The rhizoplane bacterial communities for 
      each of the four tree species sampled clustered separately from one another on an 
      ordination, suggesting that these assemblages are linked to chemical and 
      biological characteristics of the host or possibly to the mycorrhizal fungi 
      present. Bacterial communities of the rhizoplane had various similarities to 
      surrounding bulk soils. Acidobacteria, Alphaproteobacteria, and 
      Betaproteobacteria were dominant in rhizoplane communities and in bulk soils from 
      the same depth (0-10 cm). In contrast, the relative abundance of certain 
      bacterial lineages on the rhizoplane was different from that in bulk soils: 
      Bacteroidetes and Betaproteobacteria, which are known as copiotrophs, were much 
      more abundant in the rhizoplane in comparison to bulk soil. At the genus level, 
      Burkholderia, Acidobacterium, Dyella, and Edaphobacter were more abundant in the 
      rhizoplane. Burkholderia, which are known as both pathogens and mutualists of 
      plants, were especially abundant on the rhizoplane of all tree species sampled. 
      The Burkholderia species present included known mutualists of tropical crops and 
      also known N fixers. The host-specific character of tropical tree rhizoplane 
      bacterial communities may have implications for understanding nutrient cycling, 
      recruitment, and structuring of tree species diversity in tropical forests. Such 
      understanding may prove to be useful in both tropical forestry and conservation.

AB  - Pesticides applied on sugarcane reach the subsoil of riparian forests and 
      probably contaminate the river water. This work was conducted to learn about the 
      phytoremediation of atrazine and subsoil contamination using the common riparian 
      forest species of Cecropia hololeuca Miq. and Trema micranta (L.) Blum. These 
      plants were grown in soil microcosms where (14)C-atrazine at 1/10 of the 
      field-recommended dose was applied at the bottom of the microcosm simulating the 
      movement from contaminated ground water to the upper soil layers and into plants. 
      Residues of (14)C-atrazine were detected in all parts of the microcosm including 
      soil, rhizosphere and the roots in different layers of the microcosm, stem and 
      leaves. Atrazine mineralization was higher (10.2%) in the microcosms with plants 
      than the control microcosms without plants (1.2%). The upward movement of this 
      pesticide from deeper to more superficial soil layers occurred in all the 
      microcosms with plants, powered by evapotranspiration process. From the atrazine 
      applied in this study about 45% was taken up by C. hololeuca and 35% by T. 
      micrantha. The highest amount of radioactivity (%) was found in the fine roots 
      and the specific radioactivity (% g(-1)) showed that thick, fine roots and leaves 
      bioaccumulate atrazine. The enhanced mineralization of atrazine as well the 
      phytostabilization effect of the tree biomass will reduce the bioavailability of 
      these residues and consequently decrease the hazardous effects on the 
      environment.

AB  - Soil temperature is proposed to affect the photosynthetic rate and carbon 
      allocation in boreal trees through sink limitation. The aim of this study was to 
      investigate the effect of temperature on CO(2) exchange, biomass partitioning and 
      ectomycorrhizal (ECM) fungi of boreal tree species. We measured carbon 
      allocation, above- and below-ground CO(2) exchange and the species composition of 
      associated ECM fungi in the rhizosphere of Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.), 
      Norway spruce (Picea abies K.) and silver birch (Betula pendula Roth) seedlings 
      grown in soil maintained at 7-12, 12-15 and 16-22  degrees C. We found increased root 
      biomass and photosynthetic rate at higher soil temperatures, but simultaneously 
      with photosynthesis rate, higher temperature generally increased soil respiration 
      as well as shoot, and root and rhizosphere respiration. The net CO(2) exchange 
      and seedling biomass did not increase significantly with increasing temperature 
      due to a concomitant increase in carbon assimilation and respiration rates. The 
      2-month-long growth period in different soil temperatures did not alter the ECM 
      fungi species composition and the below-ground carbon sink strength did not seem 
      to be directly related to ECM biomass and species composition in any of the tree 
      species. Ectomycorrhizal species composition and number of mycorrhiza did not 
      explain the CO(2) exchange results at different temperatures.

TI  - [Phosphorus characteristics in rhizosphere soil of Cunninghamia lanceolata, Pinus 
      massoniana and their mixed plantations].
PG  - 2815-21
AB  - In 2007-2010, a comparative study was conducted on the phosphorus characteristics 
      in the rhizosphere soil of Cunninghamia lanceolata, Pinus massoniana and C. 
      lanceolata-P. massoniana mixed plantations in a forest farm in Nanping City of 
      Fujian Province, East China. In the rhizosphere soil of pure C. lanceolata and P. 
      massoniana plantations, the content of available P was higher than that in 
      non-rhizosphere soil. As compared with non-rhizosphere soil, the rhizophere soil 
      in the three plantations had lower pH and O-P content but higher Al-P and Fe-P 
      contents, and its P adsorption capacity was lower while the P desorption rate and 
      desorbed P were in adverse. In the rhizophere soil of pure P. massoniana 
      plantation, the contents of available P, Fe-P, and Al-P, their desorption rates, 
      and desorption capacity were higher, but the O-P content and the adsorbed P were 
      lower, as compared with those in the rhizophere soil of pure C. lanceolata 
      plantation. In the mixed plantation, the P activation in rhizophere soil was 
      further improved, being more obvious under C. lanceolata, which suggested that 
      mixed plantation of C. lanceolata and P. massoniana could promote the phosphorus 
      nutrition of C. lanceolata.

TI  - Taxon-specific metagenomics of Trichoderma reveals a narrow community of 
      opportunistic species that regulate each other's development.
PG  - 69-83
LID - 10.1099/mic.0.052555-0 [doi]
AB  - In this paper, we report on the in situ diversity of the mycotrophic fungus 
      Trichoderma (teleomorph Hypocrea, Ascomycota, Dikarya) revealed by a 
      taxon-specific metagenomic approach. We designed a set of genus-specific internal 
      transcribed spacer (ITS)1 and ITS2 rRNA primers and constructed a clone library 
      containing 411 molecular operational taxonomic units (MOTUs). The overall species 
      composition in the soil of the two distinct ecosystems in the Danube floodplain 
      consisted of 15 known species and two potentially novel taxa. The latter taxa 
      accounted for only 1.5 % of all MOTUs, suggesting that almost no hidden or 
      uncultivable Hypocrea/Trichoderma species are present at least in these temperate 
      forest soils. The species were unevenly distributed in vertical soil profiles 
      although no universal factors controlling the distribution of all of them 
      (chemical soil properties, vegetation type and affinity to rhizosphere) were 
      revealed. In vitro experiments simulating infrageneric interactions between the 
      pairs of species that were detected in the same soil horizon showed a broad 
      spectrum of reactions from very strong competition over neutral coexistence to 
      the pronounced synergism. Our data suggest that only a relatively small portion 
      of Hypocrea/Trichoderma species is adapted to soil as a habitat and that the 
      interaction between these species should be considered in a screening for 
      Hypocrea/Trichoderma as an agent(s) of biological control of pests.

TI  - Yeast communities associated with the bulk-soil, rhizosphere and

AB  - Soil microorganisms play an important role in soil quality and they interact 
      closely with vegetation. Little is known about yeast diversity and function in 
      forest soil ecosystems and their interactions with other biotic soil components, 
      particularly in the mycorrhizosphere. We studied the diversity of yeasts 
      inhabiting the bulk-soil, rhizosphere and ectomycorrhizosphere of a Nothofagus 
      pumilio forest in Nahuel Huapi National Park (Bariloche, Argentina). 
      Ectomycorrhizal infection was observed in all N. pumilio trees studied. A total 
      of 126 yeast isolates were obtained, including 18 known and three possibly new 
      species. Basidiomycetous yeasts were predominant in all soil fractions, and the 
      most frequently isolated species was Cryptococcus podzolicus. Diversity indices 
      and multivariate analyses were used to study and compare yeast communities in the 
      bulk-soil, rhizosphere and ectomycorrhizosphere. Yeasts able to ferment glucose 
      were found associated with the rhizosphere. Many of the recovered yeast species 
      were associated with lignocelluloses compound degradation, which suggest that 
      yeast plays an important role as a decomposer in these forest soils. Each soil 
      fraction has a distinct yeast assemblage related to their physiologic capacities 
      and soil nutrient availability.

TI  - Bacterial structure and characterization of plant growth promoting and oil 
      degrading bacteria from the rhizospheres of mangrove plants.
PG  - 535-43

AB  - Most oil from oceanic spills converges on coastal ecosystems, such as mangrove 
      forests, which are threatened with worldwide disappearance. Particular bacteria 
      that inhabit the rhizosphere of local plant species can stimulate plant 
      development through various mechanisms; it would be advantageous if these would 
      also be capable of degrading oil. Such bacteria may be important in the 
      preservation or recuperation of mangrove forests impacted by oil spills. This 
      study aimed to compare the bacterial structure, isolate and evaluate bacteria 
      able to degrade oil and stimulate plant growth, from the rhizospheres of three 
      mangrove plant species. These features are particularly important taking into 
      account recent policies for mangrove bioreme-diation, implying that oil 
      degradation as well as plant maintenance and health are key targets. Fifty-seven 
      morphotypes were isolated from the mangrove rhizospheres on Bushneil-Haas (BH) 
      medium supplemented with oil as the sole carbon source and tested for plant 
      growth promotion. Of this strains, 60% potentially fixed nitrogen, 16% showed 
      antimicrobial activity, 84% produced siderophores, 51% had the capacity to 
      solubilize phosphate, and 33% produced the indole acetic acid hormone. Using gas 
      chromatography, we evaluated the oil-degrading potential of ten selected strains 
      that had different morphologies and showed Plant Growth Promoting Rhizobacteria 
      (PGPR) features. The ten tested strains showed a promising degradation profile 
      for at least one compound present in the oil. Among degrader strains, 46% had 
      promising PGPR potential, having at least three of the above capacities. These 
      strains might be used as a consortium, allowing the concomitant degradation of 
      oil and stimulation of mangrove plant survival and maintenance.

TI  - Archaeorhizomycetes: unearthing an ancient class of ubiquitous soil fungi.
PG  - 876-9
LID - 10.1126/science.1206958 [doi]
AB  - Estimates suggest that only one-tenth of the true fungal diversity has been 
      described. Among numerous fungal lineages known only from environmental DNA 
      sequences, Soil Clone Group 1 is the most ubiquitous. These globally distributed 
      fungi may dominate below-ground fungal communities, but their placement in the 
      fungal tree of life has been uncertain. Here, we report cultures of this group 
      and describe the class, Archaeorhizomycetes, phylogenetically placed within 
      subphylum Taphrinomycotina in the Ascomycota. Archaeorhizomycetes comprises 
      hundreds of cryptically reproducing filamentous species that do not form 
      recognizable mycorrhizal structures and have saprotrophic potential, yet are 
      omnipresent in roots and rhizosphere soil and show ecosystem and host root 
      habitat specificity.

TI  - Fungal assemblages in the rhizosphere and rhizoplane of grasses of the subfamily 
      Panicoideae in the Lakkavalli region of Karnataka, India.
PG  - 228-36
AB  - Fungal communities associated with roots play an important role in nutrient 
      cycling, supporting plant growth and the biocontrol of plant diseases. 
      Experiments were conducted in 2004-2006 to isolate and characterize, based on 
      their morphological features, rhizosphere and rhizoplane fungi from perennial 
      grasses of the subfamily Panicoideae growing in forests of the Western Ghats in 
      India. Fungal species were isolated on potato dextrose, czapeck dox and water 
      agar, in different locations and seasons. The results obtained on PDA were used 
      for detailed analysis since most fungi occurred in high percentages. While 
      certain grasses harbored diverse fungal species, others supported only a few 
      species. Most fungi were isolated during winter followed by the rainy and summer 
      seasons. The species richness, diversity and evenness of fungal assemblages in 
      the rhizosphere and rhizoplane depended on the grass species and season. 
      Ascomycetes were isolated in large numbers in most grass species. Species of 
      Aspergillus, Chaetomium, Penicillium and Trichoderma occurred frequently. Certain 
      others and non-sporulating fungi were grass species-specific. Most fungal species 
      colonized the middle of the root more than the root tip or root base. Results 
      suggest that perennial grasses harbor diverse fungal communities whose potential 
      could be tapped for producing secondary metabolites and managing plant diseases.

TI  - Bacterial distribution in the rhizosphere of wild barley under contrasting 
      microclimates.

AB  - BACKGROUND: All plants in nature harbor a diverse community of rhizosphere 
      bacteria which can affect the plant growth. Our samples are isolated from the 
      rhizosphere of wild barley Hordeum spontaneum at the Evolution Canyon ('EC'), 
      Israel. The bacteria which have been living in close relationship with the plant 
      root under the stressful conditions over millennia are likely to have developed 
      strategies to alleviate plant stress. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We studied 
      distribution of culturable bacteria in the rhizosphere of H. spontaneum and 
      characterized the bacterial 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate deaminase (ACCd) 
      production, biofilm production, phosphorus solubilization and halophilic 
      behavior. We have shown that the H. spontaneum rhizosphere at the stressful South 
      Facing Slope (SFS) harbors significantly higher population of ACCd producing 
      biofilm forming phosphorus solubilizing osmotic stress tolerant bacteria. 
      CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: The long-lived natural laboratory 'EC' facilitates the 
      generation of theoretical testable and predictable models of biodiversity and 
      genome evolution on the area of plant microbe interactions. It is likely that the 
      bacteria isolated at the stressful SFS offer new opportunities for the 
      biotechnological applications in our agro-ecological systems.

TI  - Native arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi in the Yungas forests, Argentina.
PG  - 273-9

AB  - The arbuscular mycorrhizal fungal (AMF) communities from the Yungas forests of 
      Argentina were studied. The AMF species present in the rhizosphere of some 
      dominant native plants (one tree: Alnus acuminata; three herbaceous species: 
      Duchesnea indica, Oxalis conorrhiza, Trifolium aff. repens; and one shrub: 
      Sambucus peruviana) from two sites (Quebrada del Portugues and Narvaez Range) of 
      the Yungas forests were isolated, identified and quantified during the four 
      seasons of the year. Twenty-two AMF morphotaxa were found. Spore density of some 
      AMF species at each site varied among seasons. The genera that most contributed 
      to the biodiversity index were Acaulospora for Quebrada del Portugues and Glomus 
      for Narvaez Range. High diversity values were observed in the Yungas forests, 
      particularly in the spring (rainy season). We concluded AMF differed in species 
      composition and seasonal sporulation dynamics in the Yungas forests.

TI  - Archaeal communities in boreal forest tree rhizospheres respond to changing soil 
      temperatures.
PG  - 205-17
LID - 10.1007/s00248-011-9837-4 [doi]
AB  - Temperature has generally great effects on both the activity and composition of 
      microbial communities in different soils. We tested the impact of soil 
      temperature and three different boreal forest tree species on the archaeal 
      populations in the bulk soil, rhizosphere, and mycorrhizosphere. Scots pine, 
      silver birch, and Norway spruce seedlings were grown in forest humus microcosms 
      at three different temperatures, 7-11.5 degrees C (night-day temperature), 12-16 degrees C, and 
      16-22 degrees C, of which 12-16 degrees C represents the typical mid-summer soil temperature in 
      Finnish forests. RNA and DNA were extracted from indigenous ectomycorrhiza, 
      non-mycorrhizal long roots, and boreal forest humus and tested for the presence 
      of archaea by nested PCR of the archaeal 16S rRNA gene followed by denaturing 
      gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) profiling and sequencing. Methanogenic 
      Euryarchaeota belonging to Methanolobus sp. and Methanosaeta sp. were detected on 
      the roots and mycorrhiza. The most commonly detected archaeal 16S rRNA gene 
      sequences belonged to group I.1c Crenarchaeota, which are typically found in 
      boreal and alpine forest soils. Interestingly, also one sequence belonging to 
      group I.1b Crenarchaeota was detected from Scots pine mycorrhiza although 
      sequences of this group are usually found in agricultural and forest soils in 
      temperate areas. Tree- and temperature-related shifts in the archaeal population 
      structure were observed. A clear decrease in crenarchaeotal DGGE band number was 
      seen with increasing temperature, and correspondingly, the number of 
      euryarchaeotal DGGE bands, mostly methanogens, increased. The greatest diversity 
      of archaeal DGGE bands was detected in Scots pine roots and mycorrhizas. No 
      archaea were detected from humus samples from microcosms without tree seedling, 
      indicating that the archaea found in the mycorrhizosphere and root systems were 
      dependent on the plant host. The detection of archaeal 16S rRNA gene sequences 
      from both RNA and DNA extractions show that the archaeal populations were living 
      and that they may have significant contribution to the methane cycle in boreal 
      forest soil, especially when soil temperatures rise.

TI  - Phytophthora himalsilva sp. nov. an unusually phenotypically variable species 
      from a remote forest in Nepal.
PG  - 275-87
LID - 10.1016/j.funbio.2010.12.013 [doi]
AB  - The Himalaya have received little investigation for Phytophthora species. In a 
      remote forest in Western Nepal ten isolates of an unknown Phytophthora were 
      recovered from the rhizosphere of Quercus, Castanopsis, Carpinus and Cupressus 
      spp. The Phytophthora, formally named here as a P. himalsilva sp. nov., is 
      homothallic with either amphigynous or paragynous antheridia and papillate, 
      highly variable sporangia which may also be facultatively caducous. Based on ITS, 
      beta-tubulin, and cox I sequences Phytophthora himalsilva falls within Phytophthora 
      Clade 2c together with Phytophthora citrophthora, Phytophthora meadii, 
      Phytophthora colocasiae, and Phytophthora botryosa. It is suggested that Clade 2c 
      has radiated within Asia. Molecular and sporangial characters indicate that P. 
      himalsilva and P. citrophthora may share a recent common ancestor although they 
      have diverged in their breeding systems. Although highly local the P. himalsilva 
      isolates exhibited significant variation in growth rates and optimum temperatures 
      for growth. This may reflect adaptation to different niches within a 
      heterogeneous sub-tropical to temperate forest environment. Their cox I 
      polymorphisms were also rather variable, including possible clustering for 
      subsite. The occurrence of a previously unknown Phytophthora in a remote forest 
      in Nepal highlights once again the plant health risk associated with moving 
      rooted plants and soil between different bio-geographical regions of the world 
      and the need for rapid pathological screening of potential risk organisms.

TI  - Ectomycorrhizal hyphae structure components of the soil bacterial community for 
      decreased phosphatase production.

AB  - Ectomycorrhizal fungi (EMF) provide nutrients to their hosts by means of hyphae 
      that extend beyond nutrient-depleted rhizosphere soil. Soil bacteria may compete 
      with EMF for nutrients or may act synergistically to enhance nutrient supply to 
      hosts. To assess the interactions between hyphae and bacteria, two types of 
      small, sand-filled mesh bags were incubated in a Pseudotsuga menziesii/Betula 
      papyrifera forest. The bags allowed ingrowth by EMF (35-mum mesh) or excluded 
      hyphae (0.5-mum mesh), while allowing migration of soil bacteria. After 
      incubation, bacteria were isolated from bags using a method to enrich for 
      Gram-positive bacteria. Isolates were assayed for phosphatase and N-acetyl 
      glucosaminidase (NAGase) activities to assess the potential to access organic 
      phosphorus and nitrogen. The average phosphatase activities were higher in 
      exclusion than ingrowth bags, while NAGase activities did not differ. 
      Streptomyces isolates, which are expected to be strong competitors and 
      antagonists of EMF, were more prevalent in ingrowth bags and yet had lower 
      phosphatase activities. Furthermore, there were no indications of antagonism 
      between fungi and Streptomyces, as there were no increases in NAGase activities 
      in ingrowth bags. We conclude that fungal hyphae can structure components of the 
      soil bacterial community for decreased extracellular enzyme production.

AB  - The degree to which rising atmospheric CO(2) will be offset by carbon (C) 
      sequestration in forests depends in part on the capacity of trees and soil 
      microbes to make physiological adjustments that can alleviate resource 
      limitation. Here, we show for the first time that mature trees exposed to CO(2) 
      enrichment increase the release of soluble C from roots to soil, and that such 
      increases are coupled to the accelerated turnover of nitrogen (N) pools in the 
      rhizosphere. Over the course of 3 years, we measured in situ rates of root 
      exudation from 420 intact loblolly pine (Pinus taeda L.) roots. Trees fumigated 
      with elevated CO(2) (200 p.p.m.v. over background) increased exudation rates (mug 
      C cm(-1) root h(-1) ) by 55% during the primary growing season, leading to a 50% 
      annual increase in dissolved organic inputs to fumigated forest soils. These 
      increases in root-derived C were positively correlated with microbial release of 
      extracellular enzymes involved in breakdown of organic N (R(2) = 0.66; P = 0.006) 
      in the rhizosphere, indicating that exudation stimulated microbial activity and 
      accelerated the rate of soil organic matter (SOM) turnover. In support of this 
      conclusion, trees exposed to both elevated CO(2) and N fertilization did not 
      increase exudation rates and had reduced enzyme activities in the rhizosphere. 
      Collectively, our results provide field-based empirical support suggesting that 
      sustained growth responses of forests to elevated CO(2) in low fertility soils 
      are maintained by enhanced rates of microbial activity and N cycling fuelled by 
      inputs of root-derived C. To the extent that increases in exudation also 
      stimulate SOM decomposition, such changes may prevent soil C accumulation in 
      forest ecosystems.

TI  - Taking root: enduring effect of rhizosphere bacterial colonization in mangroves.
PG  - e14065
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0014065 [doi]
LID - e14065
AB  - BACKGROUND: Mangrove forests are of global ecological and economic importance, 
      but are also one of the world's most threatened ecosystems. Here we present a 
      case study examining the influence of the rhizosphere on the structural 
      composition and diversity of mangrove bacterial communities and the implications 
      for mangrove reforestation approaches using nursery-raised plants. 
      METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: A barcoded pyrosequencing approach was used to 
      assess bacterial diversity in the rhizosphere of plants in a nursery setting, 
      nursery-raised transplants and native (non-transplanted) plants in the same 
      mangrove habitat. In addition to this, we also assessed bacterial composition in 
      the bulk sediment in order to ascertain if the roots of mangrove plants affect 
      sediment bacterial composition. We found that mangrove roots appear to influence 
      bacterial abundance and composition in the rhizosphere. Due to the sheer 
      abundance of roots in mangrove habitat, such an effect can have an important 
      impact on the maintenance of bacterial guilds involved in nutrient cycling and 
      other key ecosystem functions. Surprisingly, we also noted a marked impact of 
      initial nursery conditions on the rhizosphere bacterial composition of replanted 
      mangrove trees. This result is intriguing because mangroves are periodically 
      inundated with seawater and represent a highly dynamic environment compared to 
      the more controlled nursery environment. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: In as far as 
      microbial diversity and composition influences plant growth and health, this 
      study indicates that nursery conditions and early microbial colonization patterns 
      of the replants are key factors that should be considered during reforestation 
      projects. In addition to this, our results provide information on the role of the 
      mangrove rhizosphere as a habitat for bacteria from estuarine sediments.

TI  - Bacterial communities reflect the spatial variation in pollutant levels in 
      Brazilian mangrove sediment.
PG  - 341-54

AB  - The majority of oil from oceanic oil spills converges on coastal ecosystems such 
      as mangrove forests. A major challenge to mangrove bioremediation is defining the 
      mangrove's pollution levels and measuring its recuperation from pollution. 
      Bioindicators can provide a welcome tool for defining such recovery. To determine 
      if the microbial profiles reflected variation in the pollutants, samples from 
      different locations within a single mangrove with a history of exposure to oil 
      were chemically characterised, and the microbial populations were evaluated by a 
      comprehensive range of conventional and molecular methods. Multivariate 
      ordination of denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) microbial community 
      fingerprints revealed a pronounced separation between the sediment and 
      rhizosphere samples for all analysed bacterial communities (Bacteria, 
      Betaproteobacteria, Alphaproteobacteria, Actinobacteria and Pseudomonas). A 
      Mantel test revealed significant relationships between the sediment chemical 
      fertility and oil-derived pollutants, most of the bacterial community 
      fingerprints from sediment samples, and the counts by different cultivation 
      strategies. The level of total petroleum hydrocarbons was significantly 
      associated with the Bacteria and Betaproteobacteria fingerprints, whereas 
      anthracene and the total level of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons were 
      associated with the Actinobacteria. These results show that microbial communities 
      from the studied mangrove reflect the spatial variation of the chemicals in the 
      sediment, demonstrating the specific influences of oil-derived pollutants.

TI  - The presence of amino acids affects inorganic N uptake in non-mycorrhizal 
      seedlings of European beech (Fagus sylvatica).
PG  - 1118-28
LID - 10.1093/treephys/tpq050 [doi]
AB  - To investigate the impact of organic N compounds for inorganic nitrogen uptake in 
      the rhizosphere, we fed ammonium nitrate with or without amino acids (i.e., 
      glutamine or arginine) to the roots of non-mycorrhizal beech (Fagus sylvatica L.) 
      seedlings under controlled conditions at different levels of N availability. 
      Uptake of individual N sources was determined from (1)(5)N (inorganic N) and (1)(5)N (1)(3)C 
      (organic N) accumulation in the roots. In addition, gene fragments encoding 
      proteins involved in N uptake and metabolism were cloned from beech for gene 
      expression analyses by quantitative real-time PCR in the roots. Generally, 
      ammonium was preferred over nitrate as N source. Organic N sources were taken up 
      by beech roots as intact molecules. Uptake of organic N was significantly higher 
      than inorganic N uptake, thus contributing significantly to N nutrition of beech. 
      Depending on the level of N availability, inorganic N uptake was negatively 
      affected by the presence of organic N sources. This result indicates an 
      overestimation of the contribution of inorganic N uptake to N nutrition of beech 
      in previous studies. Apparently, association with mycorrhizal fungi is not 
      essential for organic N uptake by beech roots. Gene expression analyses showed 
      that transcriptional regulation of the amino acid transporters FsCAT3, FsCAT5, 
      FsAAT and FsAAP and the ammonium transporter FsAMT1.2 in the roots is involved in 
      N nutrition of beech.

AB  - The efficacy of four potential phosphate solubilizing Enterobacter isolated from 
      non-rhizospheric soil in Western ghat forest in India. Plant growth promoting 
      ability of these isolates was evaluated in cowpea. All are gram negative, rod 
      shaped, 0.8-1.6 mm in size, and psychrotrophic in nature, grow from 5 to 40 degrees C 
      (optimum temp. 28 +/- 2 degrees C). All isolates exhibits growth at a wide range of pH 
      6-12, optimum at pH 7.0 and tolerates up to 7% (w/v) salt concentration. 16S rRNA 
      gene sequencing reveals the confirmation of isolates to Enterobacter aerogenes 
      sp. (NII-0907 and NII-0929), Enterobacter cloacae subsp. cloacae sp. (NII-0931) 
      and Enterobacter asburiae sp. (NII-0934) with which they share >99% sequence 
      similarity. Under in vitro conditions, all the four isolates were found to 
      produce indole acetic acid, P-solubilization and hydrogen cyanide. The 
      P-solubilizing activity coincided with a concomitant decrease in pH of the medium 
      (pH 7.0-<3.0). The plant growth promotion properties were demonstrated through a 
      cow pea (Vigna unguiculata (L.) walp) based bioassay under greenhouse conditions. 
      Although the bacterial inoculation was found to result in significant increment 
      in root, shoot and biomass and it stimulated bacterial counts in the rhizosphere. 
      Hence, these isolates can further formulated and used for field application.

AB  - Nodulation abilities of bacteria in the subclasses Gammaproteobacteria and 
      Betaproteobacteria on black locust (Robinia pseudoacacia) were tested. 
      Pseudomonas sp., Burkholderia sp., Klebsiella sp., and Paenibacillus sp. were 
      isolated from surface-sterilized black locust nodules, but their nodulation 
      ability is unknown. The aims of this study were to determine if these bacteria 
      are symbiotic. The species and genera of the strains were determined by RFLP 
      analysis and DNA sequencing of 16S rRNA gene. Inoculation tests and histological 
      studies revealed that Pseudomonas sp. and Burkholderia sp. formed nodules on 
      black locust and also developed differentiated nodule tissue. Furthermore, a 
      phylogenetic analysis of nodA and a BLASTN analysis of the nodC, nifH, and nifHD 
      genes revealed that these symbiotic genes of Pseudomonas sp. and Burkholderia sp. 
      have high similarities with those of rhizobial species, indicating that the 
      strains acquired the symbiotic genes from rhizobial species in the soil. 
      Therefore, in an actual rhizosphere, bacterial diversity of nodulating legumes 
      may be broader than expected in the Alpha-, Beta-, and Gammaproteobacteria 
      subclasses. The results indicate the importance of horizontal gene transfer for 
      establishing symbiotic interactions in the rhizosphere.

TI  - Influence of soil fumigation by methyl bromide and methyl iodide on rhizosphere 
      and phyllosphere microbial community structure.
PG  - 427-36

AB  - Rhizosphere and phyllosphere microbial communities were evaluated on roots and 
      leaves of growth chamber-grown lettuce (Lactuca sativa (L.) cv. Green Forest) 
      plants by culture-dependent and -independent methods after soil fumigation. 
      Denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) with 16S rRNA primers followed by 
      cloning and sequencing was used to identify major rRNA bands from the rhizosphere 
      and phyllosphere. Three weeks after fumigation, there were no differences (P = 
      0.16) in rhizosphere microbial communities between the fumigated treatments and 
      the control. The same effect was observed during week seven after fumigation 
      (P=0.49). Also, no significant differences (P=0.49) were found in the 
      phyllosphere microbial communities between the fumigated treatments and the 
      control during the growth period of the plant. A majority of the bands in the 
      rhizosphere were related to known bacterial sequences with a 96 to 100 % sequence 
      similarity. Some of the derived sequences were related to Pseudomonas syringae 
      pv. tomato DC300 and Bradyrhizobium japonicum USDA 110. A total of 23 isolates 
      were identified from leaf surface by both culture-dependent and independent 
      methods, and only Photorhabdus luminescens was found on leaf surface using both 
      techniques. All the Biolog isolates from phyllosphere were from the 
      Proteobacteria phylum compared to the culture-independent bands from the leaves 
      that were from different bacterial phyla. Based on our data, methyl bromide 
      (MeBr) and methyl iodide (MeI) did not have any significant negative effects on 
      rhizosphere and phyllosphere microbial communities throughout the growing period 
      of lettuce.

TI  - Influence of forest trees on the distribution of mineral weathering-associated 
      bacterial communities of the Scleroderma citrinum mycorrhizosphere.
PG  - 4780-7
LID - 10.1128/AEM.03040-09 [doi]
AB  - In acidic forest soils, availability of inorganic nutrients is a 
      tree-growth-limiting factor. A hypothesis to explain sustainable forest 
      development proposes that tree roots select soil microbes involved in central 
      biogeochemical processes, such as mineral weathering, that may contribute to 
      nutrient mobilization and tree nutrition. Here we showed, by combining soil 
      analyses with cultivation-dependent analyses of the culturable bacterial 
      communities associated with the widespread mycorrhizal fungus Scleroderma 
      citrinum, a significant enrichment of bacterial isolates with efficient mineral 
      weathering potentials around the oak and beech mycorrhizal roots compared to bulk 
      soil. Such a difference did not exist in the rhizosphere of Norway spruce. The 
      mineral weathering ability of the bacterial isolates was assessed using a 
      microplaque assay that measures the pH and the amount of iron released from 
      biotite. Using this microplate assay, we demonstrated that the bacterial isolates 
      harboring the most efficient mineral weathering potential belonged to the 
      Burkholderia genus. Notably, previous work revealed that oak and beech harbored 
      very similar pHs in the 5- to 10-cm horizon in both rhizosphere and bulk soil 
      environments. In the spruce rhizosphere, in contrast, the pH was significantly 
      lower than that in bulk soil. Because the production of protons is one of the 
      main mechanisms responsible for mineral weathering, our results suggest that 
      certain tree species have developed indirect strategies for mineral weathering in 
      nutrient-poor soils, which lie in the selection of bacterial communities with 
      efficient mineral weathering potentials.

AB  - This study focuses on the relationships of dissolved Al and Zn speciation with 
      microbial and chemical soil properties in the bulk and rhizosphere of forest 
      soils. The soil components were sampled under Populus tremuloides Michx. at six 
      sites located close to industrial facilities. Total water-soluble (Al(WS), 
      Zn(WS)) and reactive (Al(R), Zn(R)) Al and Zn concentrations measured in soil 
      water extracts, speciation data modeled by WHAM 6, chemical properties (pH, DOC, 
      major cations and anions) and microbial properties (microbial biomass and enzyme 
      activities) were measured on all soils. Enrichment in Al(R) and Zn(R) was 
      observed in the rhizosphere compared to bulk soils. In a given soil material, the 
      speciation of Al and Zn varied according to solution pH and Al-organic as well as 
      Zn-organic complexes or Zn(2+) were generally the dominant species. The factors 
      controlling the Al(WS), Zn(WS), Al(R) and Zn(R) concentrations differed between 
      soil components, shifting from strictly chemical in the bulk (78%) to 
      interactions among microbial and chemical variables in the rhizosphere (87%). 
      Results further indicate that organic matter and pH were significantly linked to 
      these response variables in the rhizosphere. Involvement of rhizospheric 
      microorganisms occurred via pH changes induced by either the microbial 
      assimilation of nitrogen or through the release of metals during the 
      mineralization of roots. Our results therefore suggest that microbial activity is 
      an important component of the biogeochemistry of Al and Zn in the rhizosphere. 
      The study further provides key information to improve the assessment of 
      ecological risk associated to Al and Zn in forest soils.

TI  - Pyrosequencing reveals a contrasted bacterial diversity between oak rhizosphere 
      and surrounding soil.
PG  - 281-8

AB  - Several reports have highlighted that forest soil samples are more phylum-rich 
      than agricultural soil samples. However, little is known about the structure and 
      richness of the bacterial communities in forest soil. Using high-throughput next 
      generation 454 pyrosequencing, we deeply investigated the diversity of bacterial 
      communities colonizing the oak rhizosphere niche and the surrounding soil. From 
      three spatially independent soil samples, we obtained over 300 000 partial 16S 
      rRNA gene sequences. The most abundant bacterial groups were the Acidobacteria, 
      Proteobacteria and unclassified bacteria. Multifactorial analysis of the relative 
      proportions of the different phyla revealed a net differentiation of the 
      bacterial communities present in the rhizosphere and soil environments, 
      suggesting an oak rhizosphere effect. Significantly more beta-, gamma- and unclassified 
      Proteobacteria inhabited the rhizosphere when compared with the surrounding soil. 
      Conversely, significantly more unclassified bacteria were detected in the bulk 
      soil than in the rhizosphere, demonstrating that the soil remains a challenging 
      reservoir of complexity. This work increases our understanding of the niche 
      effect on bacterial diversity and on the rare phylogenetic groups inhabiting the 
      soil.

TI  - Accumulation of potassium, rubidium and caesium (133Cs and 137Cs in various 
      fractions of soil and fungi in a Swedish forest.
PG  - 2543-8
LID - 10.1016/j.scitotenv.2010.02.024 [doi]
AB  - Radiocaesium ((137)Cs) was widely deposited over large areas of forest in Sweden 
      as a result of the Chernobyl accident in 1986 and many people in Sweden eat wild 
      fungi and game obtained from these contaminated forests. In terms of radioisotope 
      accumulation in the food chain, it is well known that fungal sporocarps 
      efficiently accumulate radiocaesium ((137)Cs), as well as the alkali metals 
      potassium (K), rubidium (Rb) and caesium (Cs). The fungi then enhance uptake of 
      these elements into host plants. This study compared the accumulation of these 
      three alkali metals in bulk soil, rhizosphere, soil-root interface, fungal 
      mycelium and sporocarps of mycorrhizal fungi in a Swedish forest. The soil-root 
      interface was found to be distinctly enriched in K and Rb compared with the bulk 
      soil. Potassium concentrations increased in the order: bulk 
      soil<rhizosphere<fungal mycelium<soil-root interface<fungal sporocarps; and Rb 
      concentration in the order: bulk soil<rhizosphere<soil-root interface<fungal 
      mycelium<fungal sporocarps. Caesium was more or less evenly distributed within 
      the bulk soil, rhizosphere and soil-root interface fractions, but was actively 
      accumulated by fungi. Fungi showed a greater preference for Rb and K than Cs, so 
      the uptake of (137)Cs could be prevented by providing additional Rb or K at 
      contaminated sites. The levels of K, Rb, and Cs found in sporocarps were at least 
      one order of magnitude higher than those in fungal mycelium. These results 
      provide new insights into the use of transfer factors or concentration ratios. 
      The final step, the transfer of alkali metals from fungal mycelium to sporocarps, 
      raised some specific questions about possible mechanisms.

AB  - A new Phytophthora species, isolated from rhizosphere soil of declining or dead 
      trees of Eucalyptus gomphocephala, E. marginata, Agonis flexuosa, and another 13 
      plant species, and from fine roots of E. marginata and collar lesions of Banksia 
      attenuata in Western Australia, is described as Phytophthora multivora sp. nov. 
      It is homothallic and produces semipapillate sporangia, smooth-walled oogonia 
      containing thick-walled oospores, and paragynous antheridia. Although 
      morphologically similar to P. citricola, phylogenetic analyses of the ITS and 
      cox1 gene regions demonstrate that P. multivora is unique. Phytophthora multivora 
      is pathogenic to bark and cambium of E. gomphocephala and E. marginata and is 
      believed to be involved in the decline syndrome of both eucalypt species within 
      the tuart woodland in south-west Western Australia.

TI  - Soil respiration fluxes in a temperate mixed forest: seasonality and temperature 
      sensitivities differ among microbial and root-rhizosphere respiration.
PG  - 165-76
LID - 10.1093/treephys/tpp106 [doi]
AB  - Although soil respiration, a major CO(2) flux in terrestrial ecosystems, is known 
      to be highly variable with time, the response of its component fluxes to 
      temperature and phenology is less clear. Therefore, we partitioned soil 
      respiration (SR) into microbial (MR) and root-rhizosphere respiration (RR) using 
      small root exclusion treatments in a mixed mountain forest in Switzerland. In 
      addition, fine root respiration (FRR) was determined with measurements of excised 
      roots. RR and FRR were strongly related to each other (R(2) = 0.92, n = 7), with 
      RR contributing about 46% and FRR about 32% to total SR. RR rates increased more 
      strongly with temperature (Q(10) = 3.2) than MR rates (Q(10) = 2.3). Since the 
      contribution of RR to SR was found to be higher during growing (50%) than during 
      dormant periods (40%), we separated the 2-year data set into phenophases. During 
      the growing period of 2007, the temperature sensitivity of RR (Q(10) = 2.5, R(2) 
      = 0.62) was similar to that of MR (Q(10) = 2.2, R(2) = 0.57). However, during the 
      dormant period of 2006/2007, RR was not related to soil temperature (R(2) = 0.44, 
      n.s.), in contrast to MR (Q(10) = 7.2; R(2) = 0.92). To better understand the 
      influence of plant activity on root respiration, we related RR and FRR rates to 
      photosynthetic active radiation (both R(2) = 0.67, n = 7, P = 0.025), suggesting 
      increased root respiration rates during times with high photosynthesis. During 
      foliage green-up in spring 2008, i.e., from bud break to full leaf expansion, RR 
      increased by a factor of 5, while soil temperature increased only by about 5 
      degrees C, leading to an extraordinary high Q(10) of 10.6; meanwhile, the 
      contribution of RR to SR increased from 29 to 47%. This clearly shows that root 
      respiration and its apparent temperature sensitivity highly depend on plant 
      phenology and thus on canopy assimilation and carbon allocation belowground.

TI  - Pinus pinaster seedlings and their fungal symbionts show high plasticity in 
      phosphorus acquisition in acidic soils.
PG  - 1587-97
LID - 10.1093/treephys/tpp088 [doi]
AB  - Young seedlings of maritime pine (Pinus pinaster Soland in Ait.) were grown in 
      rhizoboxes using intact spodosol soil samples from the southwest of France, in 
      Landes of Gascogne, presenting a large variation of phosphorus (P) availability. 
      Soils were collected from a 93-year-old unfertilized stand and a 13-year-old P. 
      pinaster stand with regular annual fertilization of either only P or P and 
      nitrogen (N). After 6 months of culture in controlled conditions, different 
      morphotypes of ectomycorrhiza (ECM) were used for the measurements of acid 
      phosphatase activity and molecular identification of fungal species using 
      amplification of the ITS region. Total biomass, N and P contents were measured in 
      roots and shoots of plants. Bicarbonate- and NaOH-available inorganic P (Pi), 
      organic P (Po) and ergosterol concentrations were measured in bulk and 
      rhizosphere soil. The results showed that bulk soil from the 93-year-old forest 
      stand presented the highest Po levels, but relatively higher 
      bicarbonate-extractable Pi levels compared to 13-year-old unfertilized stand. 
      Fertilizers significantly increased the concentrations of inorganic P fractions 
      in bulk soil. Ergosterol contents in rhizosphere soil were increased by 
      fertilizer application. The dominant fungal species was Rhizopogon luteolus 
      forming 66.6% of analysed ECM tips. Acid phosphatase activity was highly variable 
      and varied inversely with bicarbonate-extractable Pi levels in the rhizosphere 
      soil. Total P or total N in plants was linearly correlated with total plant 
      biomass, but the slope was steep only between total P and biomass in fertilized 
      soil samples. In spite of high phosphatase activity in ECM tips, P availability 
      remained a limiting nutrient in soil samples from unfertilized stands. 
      Nevertheless young P. pinaster seedlings showed a high plasticity for biomass 
      production at low P availability in soils.

TI  - Arbuscular mycorrhizae of dominant plant species in Yungas forests, Argentina.
PG  - 612-21
AB  - In Argentina the Yungas forests are among the ecosystems most affected by human 
      activity, with loss of biodiversity. To assess the arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) 
      colonization and the arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) spore numbers in these 
      ecosystems, the roots of the most dominant native plants (one tree, Alnus 
      acuminata; three herbaceous, Duchesnea indica, Oxalis conorrhiza, Trifolium aff. 
      repens; and one shrub, Sambucus peruviana) were studied throughout the year from 
      two sites of Yungas forests. Assessments of mycorrhizal colonization (percent 
      root length, intraradical structures) were made by washing and staining the 
      roots. Soil samples of each plant species were pooled and subsamples were 
      obtained to determine AM spore numbers. The herbaceous species formed both Arum- 
      and Paris-type morphologies, whereas the tree and the shrub species formed 
      respectively single structural types of Arum- and Paris-type. AM colonization, 
      intraradical fungi structures and AMF spore numbers displayed variation in 
      species, seasons and sites. D. indica showed the highest AM colonization, whereas 
      the highest spore numbers was observed in the rhizosphere of A. acuminata. No 
      correlation was observed between spore numbers and root length percentage 
      colonized by AM fungi. Results of this study showed that Alnus acuminata is 
      facultatively AM. The AM colonization, intraradical fungi structures and AMF 
      spore numbers varied in species depending on phenological, climatic and edaphic 
      conditions.

TI  - First Report of Trichodorus variopapillatus (Nematoda: Trichodoridae) from the 
      Czech Republic.
PG  - 966
LID - 10.1094/PDIS-93-9-0966A [doi]
AB  - Members of the Trichodoridae can cause substantial crop losses directly by 
      feeding on plant roots and indirectly as vectors of tobraviruses; both vector and 
      virus are polyphagous. In April of 2008, soil samples from the rhizosphere of 
      Ulmus minor Mill in a deciduous broadleaf forest at Krivoklat yielded a 
      population of Trichodorus variopapillatus Hooper, 1972. Nematodes were identified 
      by morphological and morphometric characters as well as by molecular analysis. 
      For classical identification, specimens were extracted from soil by a 
      decanting-sieving method, heat killed and fixed in triethanolamine formalin, and 
      processed and mounted in anhydrous glycerin. For molecular analysis, specimens 
      were stored at -20 degrees C in 1 M NaCl. Specimens largely agreed with T. 
      variopapillatus (1,3). Average morphometric data of five male specimens are: body 
      length 766 mum; body width 33 mum; onchiostyle length 55 mum; and spicule length 43 
      mum. Number of anterior ventromedian cervical papillae and number of precloacal 
      supplements was three each. Spicules are regularly curved and the manubrium is 
      knob-like. Morphometric data of two female specimens are: body length 663 and 858 
      mum; body width 29 and 38 mum; onchiostyle length 52 and 53 mum; V 54 and 57%. 
      Refractive thickenings at the vulva are very large and quandrangular in shape in 
      the lateral optical section. Identification of these nematodes was further 
      verified by sequencing two regions of rDNA (18S gene and D2/D3 expansion segments 
      of the 28S gene). Single female and male specimens from NaCl storage were 
      transferred to 0.5-ml Eppendorf tubes containing 0.25M NaOH. Total genomic DNA 
      was prepared by a rapid technique (4). The 18S gene was amplified in three 
      fragments using the primer SSU_F_04 + SSU_R_09 (first fragment), SSU_F_22 + 
      SSU_R_13 (second fragment), and SSU_F_23 + SSU_R_81 (third fragment). D2/D3 
      expansion segments of the large subunit of rDNA were amplified using the forward 
      primer D2A and the reverse primer D3B (2). The regions were sequenced in both 
      directions after purification of PCR products. The sequences of female and male 
      specimens were identical. The sequences were deposited in GenBank with Accession 
      Nos. GQ148719 (28S) and GQ148719 (18S). The length of 18S was 1,760 bp and D2/D3 
      was 786 bp. The obtained sequences were compared by BLAST in NCBI. The D2/D3 
      sequence is not available in GenBank for T. variopapillatus. The best BLAST hits 
      were obtained with Trichodorus species. BLAST results of 18S sequence showed 5% 
      divergence (76 substitutions) after trimming unequal ends with published sequence 
      of T. variopapillatus Accession No. AY284841. All substitutions were confirmed 
      from the chromatographs. To our knowledge, this is the first report of T. 
      variopapillatus associated with U. minor in the Czech Republic. References: (1)

      sustainable urban forests and stormwater management. We evaluated tree water 
      uptake and root distribution in a novel stormwater mitigation facility that 
      integrates trees directly into detention reservoirs under pavement. The system 
      relies on structural soils: highly porous engineered mixes designed to support 
      tree root growth and pavement. To evaluate tree performance under the peculiar 
      conditions of such a stormwater detention reservoir (i.e., periodically 
      inundated), we grew green ash (Fraxinus pennsylvanica Marsh.) and swamp white oak 
      (Quercus bicolor Willd.) in either CUSoil or a Carolina Stalite-based mix 
      subjected to three simulated below-system infiltration rates for two growing 
      seasons. Infiltration rate affected both transpiration and rooting depth. In a 
      factorial experiment with ash, rooting depth always increased with infiltration 
      rate for Stalite, but this relation was less consistent for CUSoil. Slow-drainage 
      rates reduced transpiration and restricted rooting depth for both species and 
      soils, and trunk growth was restricted for oak, which grew the most in moderate 
      infiltration. Transpiration rates under slow infiltration were 55% (oak) and 70% 
      (ash) of the most rapidly transpiring treatment (moderate for oak and rapid for 
      ash). We conclude this system is feasible and provides another tool to address 
      runoff that integrates the function of urban green spaces with other urban needs.

AB  - The introduction of photosynthates through plant roots is a major source of 
      carbon (C) for soil microbial biota and shapes the composition of fungal and 
      bacterial communities in the rhizosphere. Although the importance of this 
      process, especially to ectomycorrhizal fungi, has been known for some time, the 
      extent to which plant belowground C allocation controls the composition of the 
      wider soil community is not understood. A tree-girdling experiment enabled 
      studies of the relationship between plant C allocation and microbial community 
      composition. Girdling involves cutting the phloem of trees to prevent 
      photosynthates from entering the soil. Four years after girdling, fungal and 
      bacterial communities were characterized using DNA-based profiles and cloning and 
      sequencing. Data showed that girdling significantly altered fungal and bacterial 
      communities compared with the control. The ratio of ectomycorrhizal to saprobic 
      fungal sequences significantly decreased in girdled treatments, and this decline 
      was found to correlate with the fungal phospholipid fatty acid biomarker 
      18:2omega6,9. Bacterial communities also varied in the abundance of the two 
      dominant phyla Acidobacteria and Alphaproteobacteria. Concomitant changes in 
      fungal and bacterial communities suggest linkages between these two groups and 
      point toward plant belowground C allocation as a key determinant of microbial 
      community composition.

TI  - Scale and the isotopic record of C4 plants in pedogenic carbonate: from the biome 
      to the rhizosphere.
PG  - 1498-511
AB  - The 13C/12C ratio in pedogenic carbonate (i.e., CaCO3 formed in soil) is a 
      significant tool for investigating C4 biomes of the past. However, the 
      paleoecological meaning of delta13C values in pedogenic carbonate can change with 
      the scale at which one considers the data. We describe studies of modern soils, 
      fossil soils, and vegetation change in the Chihuahuan Desert of North America and 
      elsewhere that reveal four scales important for paleoecologic interpretations. 
      (1) At the broadest scale, the biome scale (hundreds to millions of km2), an 
      isotopic record interpreted as C3 vegetation replacing C4 grasslands may indicate 
      invading C3 woody shrubs instead of expanding C3 forests (a common 
      interpretation). (2) At the landscape scale (several tens of m2 to hundreds of 
      km2), the accuracy of scaling up paleoclimatic interpretations to a regional 
      level is affected by the landform containing the isotopic record. (3) At the 
      soil-profile scale (cm2 to m2), soil profiles with multiple generations of 
      carbonate mixed together have a lower-resolution paleoecologic record than soil 
      profiles repeatedly buried. (4) At the rhizosphere scale (microm2 to cm2), 
      carbonate formed on roots lack the 14-17 per thousand enrichment observed at 
      broader scales, revealing different fractionation processes at different scales. 
      A multi-scale approach in dealing with delta13C in pedogenic carbonate will 
      increase the accuracy of paleoecologic interpretations and understanding of 
      soil-geomorphic-climatic interactions that affect boundaries between C4 and C3 
      vegetation.

TI  - Ostryopsis davidiana seedlings inoculated with ectomycorrhizal fungi facilitate 
      formation of mycorrhizae on Pinus tabulaeformis seedlings.
PG  - 425-434
LID - 10.1007/s00572-009-0245-2 [doi]
AB  - Reforestation in China is important for reversing anthropogenic activities that 
      degrade the environment. Pinus tabulaeformis is desired for these activities, but 
      survival and growth of seedlings can be hampered by lack of ectomycorrhizae. When 
      outplanted in association with Ostryopsis davidiana plants on reforestation 
      sites, P. tabulaeformis seedlings become mycorrhizal and survival and growth are 
      enhanced; without O. davidiana, pines often remain without mycorrhizae and 
      performance is poorer. To better understand this relationship, we initiated an 
      experiment using rhizoboxes that restricted root and tested the hypothesis that 
      O. davidiana seedlings facilitated ectomycorrhizae formation on P. tabulaeformis 
      seedlings through hyphal contact. We found that without O. davidiana seedlings, 
      inocula of five indigenous ectomycorrhizal fungi were unable to grow and 
      associate with P. tabulaeformis seedlings. Inocula placed alongside O. davidiana 
      seedlings, however, resulted in enhanced growth and nutritional status of O. 
      davidiana and P. tabulaeformis seedlings, and also altered rhizosphere pH and 
      phosphatase activity. We speculate that these species form a common mycorrhizal 
      network and this association enhances outplanting performance of P. tabulaeformis 
      seedlings used for forest restoration.

AB  - AIM: To detect and quantify the plant drought tolerance enhancing bacterium 
      Paenibacillus polymyxa in a collection of 160 Hordeum spontaneum rhizosphere 
      samples at the 'Evolution Canyon' ('EC'), Israel. METHODS AND RESULTS: PCR 
      primers and a FAM-TAMRA probe (6-carboxyfluorescein, 
      6-carboxy-tetramethyl-rhodamine) targeting 16S rRNA genes were designed and used 
      to detect and quantify the target strain. Two commercial kits, Bio101 Fast Spin 
      and Mo Bio Ultra Clean Soil DNA, were tested for DNA isolation from the 
      rhizosphere and surrounding soil. Population densities of P. polymyxa were 
      studied in the rhizosphere of wild barley and surrounding soil from the 
      contrasting climatic slopes at the 'EC' using the real-time PCR and culture based 
      methods. CONCLUSION: Paenibacillus polymyxa is one of the best established 
      species in wild barley rhizosphere at the 'EC' slopes. With the real-time PCR 
      assay we are able to detect 1 pg of DNA per PCR corresponding to 100 cells per 
      ml. The results at the 'EC' correlate well to bacterial estimations by culture 
      based methods. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: Significantly higher P. 
      polymyxa cell number was detected in the rhizosphere of arid 'African' 
      microclimate indicating possible role of adaptive co-evolution with plants.

PG  - 1444-52

AB  - The genus Collimonas consists of soil bacteria that have the potential to grow at 
      the expense of living fungal hyphae. However, the consequences of this 
      mycophagous ability for soil fungi are unknown. Here we report on the development 
      of fungal communities after introduction of collimonads in a soil that had a low 
      abundance of indigenous collimonads. Development of fungal communities was 
      stimulated by addition of cellulose or by introducing plants (Plantago 
      lanceolata). Community composition of total fungi in soil and rhizosphere and of 
      arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi in roots was examined by PCR-DGGE. The introduction 
      of collimonads altered the composition of all fungal communities studied but had 
      no effects on fungal biomass increase, cellulose degrading activity or plant 
      performance. The most likely explanation for these results is that differences in 
      sensitivity of fungal species to the presence of collimonads result in 
      competitive replacement of species. The lab and greenhouse experiments were 
      complemented with a field experiment. Mesh bags containing sterile sand with or 
      without collimonads were buried in an ex-arable field and a forest. The presence 
      of collimonads had an effect on the composition of fungi invading these bags in 
      the ex-arable site but not in the forest site.

TI  - Rhizosphere carbon deposition, oxidative stress and nutritional changes in two 
      poplar species exposed to aluminum.
PG  - 423-36
LID - 10.1093/treephys/tpn035 [doi]
AB  - Species and hybrids in the genus Populus have become the focus of investigation 
      for use in biofuels production and their capacity to sequester carbon (C) in the 
      environment. The identification of species resistant to marginal edaphic sites 
      may be important in both of these endeavors. Plant growth, total dissolved 
      organic carbon (TOC) and low molecular weight organic acid (OA) production, 
      antioxidative enzyme activities and mineral content were assessed in Populus 
      tremuloides L. and Populus trichocarpa Torr. & Gray seedlings under exposure to 
      aluminum (Al). Both species were sensitive to Al, with significant reductions in 
      shoot and root biomass at and above 50 microM Al. Exposure to Al induced 40-fold 
      increases in TOC deposition in P. tremuloides and 100-fold increases in P. 
      trichocarpa. In P. tremuloides, Al treatment induced root exudation of malic and 
      citric acids, while Al increased exudation of citrate and oxalate in P. 
      trichocarpa. Organic acids accounted for 20-64% of total C released upon Al 
      exposure, with the proportion of OAs increasing in P. tremuloides and decreasing 
      in P. trichocarpa. Dose-dependent responses of catalase and ascorbate peroxidase 
      were observed in both root and leaf tissues, indicating that Al exposure induced 
      oxidative stress in poplar. Treatment at and above 100 microM Al reduced the 
      concentrations of calcium (Ca) and magnesium (Mg) in roots and leaves, whereas Al 
      at or above 50 microM reduced root and leaf phosphorous (P) concentrations. The 
      majority of Al taken up was retained in the root system. Even with the induction 
      of OA exudation and accumulation, P. tremuloides and P. trichocarpa remained 
      sensitive to Al, as evidenced by elevated antioxidative enzyme activities, which 
      may reflect inhibition of Ca or P uptake and destabilization of cell homeostasis 
      in these poplar species. Although plants exhibited reductions in growth and 
      evidence of oxidative and nutritional stress, total C rhizodeposition rates for 
      both species increased with increasing Al exposure concentration. Estimated C 
      deposition rates of 16 mg C plant(-1) day(-1) were four-times larger than 
      previously reported values for forest tree species, indicating that edaphic 
      stress plays an important role in C flux to the rhizosphere.

      ecosystem: spatial distribution and nutrient limitations.
PG  - 14-24
LID - 10.1007/s00248-008-9461-0 [doi]
AB  - Rapid physiological profiling of heterotrophic microbial communities enables 
      intensive analysis of the factors affecting activity in aerobic habitats, such as 
      soil. Previous methods for performing such profiling were severely limited due to 
      enrichment bias and inflexibility in incubation conditions. We tested a new 
      physiological profiling approach based on a microtiter plate oxygen sensor system 
      (Becton Dickinson Oxygen Biosensor System (BDOBS)), which allows for testing of 
      lower substrate addition (i.e., lower enrichment potential) and manipulation of 
      physiochemical assay conditions, such as pH and nutrients. Soil microbial 
      communities associated with a scrub-oak forest ecosystem on Merritt Island 
      Wildlife Refuge in central Florida, USA, were studied in order to evaluate 
      microbial activity in a nutrient poor soil and to provide baseline data on the 
      site for subsequent evaluation of the effects of elevated CO(2) on ecosystem 
      function. The spatial variation in physiological activity amongst different 
      habitats (litter, bulk soil, and rhizosphere) was examined as a function of 
      adaptation to local resources (i.e., water soluble extracts of roots and leaf 
      litter) and the degree of N and P limitation. All the communities were primarily 
      N-limited, with a secondary P limitation, which was greater in the rhizosphere 
      and bulk soil. The litter community showed greater overall oxygen consumption 
      when exposed to litter extracts relative to the rhizosphere or soil, suggesting 
      acclimation toward greater use of the mixed substrates in the extract. Root 
      extracts were readily used by communities from all the habitats with no habitat 
      specific acclimation observed. A priming effect was detected in all habitats; 
      addition of glucose caused a significant increase in the use of soil organic 
      carbon. Response to added glucose was only observed with N and P addition, 
      suggesting that C may be lost to the groundwater from these porous soils because 
      nutrient limitation prevents C immobilization.

TI  - [Effects of bio-mulching on rhizosphere soil microbial population, enzyme 
      activity and tree growth in poplar plantation].
PG  - 1204-10
AB  - Coriaria nepalensis, Pteridium aquilinum var. latiuscukum, Imperata cylindrical 
      var. major, and Quercus fabric were used as mulching materials to study their 
      effects on the rhizosphere soil microbial population and enzyme activity and the 
      tree growth in poplar plantation. The results showed that after mulching with 
      test materials, the populations of both bacteria and fungi in rhizosphere soil 
      were more than those of the control. Of the mulching materials, I. cylindrical 
      and Q. fabric had the best effect, with the numbers of bacteria and fungi being 
      23.56 and 1.43 times higher than the control, respectively. The bacterial and 
      fungal populations in rhizosphere soil increased with increasing mulching amount. 
      When the mulching amount was 7.5 kg m(-2), the numbers of bacteria and fungi in 
      rhizosphere soil were 0.5 and 5.14 times higher than the control, respectively. 
      Under bio-mulching, the bacterial and fungal populations in rhizosphere soil had 
      a similar annual variation trend, which was accorded with the annual fluctuation 
      of soil temperature and got to the maximum in July and the minimum in December. 
      The urease and phosphatase activities in rhizosphere soil also increased with 
      increasing mulching amount. As for the effects of different mulching materials on 
      the enzyme activities, they were in the order of C. nepalensis > P. aquilinum > 
      I. cylindrical > Q. fabric. The annual variation of urease and phosphatase 
      activities in rhizosphere soil was similar to that of bacterial and fungal 
      populations, being the highest in July and the lowest in December. Bio-mulching 
      promoted the tree height, DBH, and biomass of poplar trees significantly.

TI  - First Report of the Dagger Nematode Xiphinema dentatum (Nematoda: Longidoridae) 
      in a Deciduous Forest in the Czech Republic.
PG  - 1370
LID - 10.1094/PDIS-92-9-1370B [doi]
AB  - Xiphinema species are migratory ectoparasitic nematodes that feed on an extensive 
      range of hosts and several species are vectors of nepoviruses. These long 
      nematodes are readily distinguished from most other plant parasitic nematodes by 
      a long stylet with forked odontostyle and flanged odontophore. In May of 2005, a 
      sample from the rhizosphere of Carpinus betulus and Acer platanoides in a forest 
      near Silnicna, South Moravia yielded a population of Xiphinema dentatum Sturhan, 
      1978. X. dentatum previously has been reported to be associated with several 
      forest and grassland species in Germany, the former Yugoslavia, and Slovakia. 
      Specimens were extracted from soil by decanting-sieving. A few female specimens 
      were stored at -20 degrees C in 1 M NaCl, and the rest of the specimens were heat killed, 
      fixed in triethanolamine formalin, and mounted in anhydrous glycerin. In 2007, 
      nematodes from permanent slides were identified by morphological and 
      morphometrical characters (3): female body C shaped in fixed specimens, lip 
      region offset by a depression, reproductive system amphidelphic with the presence 
      of well developed pseudo Z-organ, and tail broadly convex-conoid to regularly 
      hemispherical; main average morphometric of females were body length 3.6 mm, 
      total stylet length 220 mum, vulva position 46%, and tail ratio 0.66. 
      Identification of these nematodes was further verified by sequencing cytochrome 
      oxidase subunit 1 (cox1) of mtDNA and D2/D3 expansion segments of large subunit 
      rDNA. Two individual female specimens from NaCl storage were transferred to 
      0.5-ml Eppendorf tubes containing 0.25 M NaOH. Total genomic DNA was prepared by 
      a rapid technique (4). The cox1 gene was amplified using forward primer COIF 
      (5'-GAT TTT TTG GKC ATC CWG ARG-3') and reverse primer COIR (5'-CWA CAT AAT AAG 
      TAT CAT G-3') (2). D2/D3 expansion segments of large subunit of rDNA were 
      amplified using forward primer D2A (5'-ACA AGT ACC GTG AGG GAA AGT TG -3') and 
      reverse primer D3B (5'-TCG GAA GGA ACC AGC TAC TA-3') (1). The regions were 
      sequenced in both directions after purification of PCR products from gel slices 
      with a Qiagen gel extraction kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). The sequences of two 
      individual females were identical. The sequences were deposited in GenBank 
      (Accession Nos. EU781537 [cox1] and EU781538 [D2/D3]). The length of cox1 was 393 
      bp and D2/D3 was 786 bp. The obtained sequences were compared by BLAST in NCBI. 
      The cox1 gene sequence is not available in GenBank for X. dentatum, but the best 
      BLAST hits were logically obtained with Xiphinema species. BLAST results of D2/D3 
      sequence showed strong similarities (99.6%) with X. dentatum Accession No. 
      AY601627 and only a three nucleotide difference was observed in the beginning of 
      the 5' end. To our knowledge, this is the first report of X. dentatum associated 
      with deciduous forest trees in the Czech Republic. Forests are the main 
      terrestrial ecosystems and rich in species diversity and are of great importance 
      as natural resources. Therefore, information on these plant parasitic nematodes 
      from forests would be useful because they are a component of the continental 
      forest diversity. References: (1) P. De Ley et al. Nematology 2:591, 1999. (2) Y.

TI  - Effect of inoculation with putative plant growth-promoting rhizobacteria isolated 
      from Pinus spp. on Pinus pinea growth, mycorrhization and rhizosphere microbial 
      communities.
PG  - 1298-309
LID - 10.1111/j.1365-2672.2008.03862.x [doi]
AB  - AIMS: In this study, 10 putative plant growth-promoting rhizobacteria (PGPR) were 
      assayed for their ability to improve Pinus pinea growth and mycorrhization. 
      METHODS AND RESULTS: After an inoculation assay, except for two, all strains 
      stimulated plant growth. All bacteria altered rhizosphere microbial communities 
      as revealed by phospholipid fatty acid analysis; associating plant growth 
      promotion with a decrease in biological diversity. Three strains were tested for 
      their ability to enhance pine mycorrhization with wild fungi species. Only strain 
      BB1 increased the total number of mycorrhizal root tips. Mycorrhizas present in 
      the roots of each treatment were identified by ribosomal RNA sequencing and 
      denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis analysis, detecting specificity between 
      mycorrhizal species colonizing the roots and the inoculated PGPR. CONCLUSIONS: In 
      conclusion, BB1 appears to be a good candidate to be developed into a 
      biofertilizer directed to enhance pine growth and mycorrhization, which should 
      result in a better establishment rate for plants used in reforestation. 
      SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: This study shows the potential of PGPR to 
      improve fitness of forest tree specie. Moreover, the specificity between the 
      bacteria inoculated and the mycorrhiza that the plant selects involve a potential 
      biotechnological use in production of value-added fungi.

TI  - Heavy metal pollution in aquatic ecosystems and its phytoremediation using 
      wetland plants: an ecosustainable approach.
PG  - 131-58
AB  - This review addresses the global problem of heavymetal pollution originating from 
      increased industrialization and urbanization and its amelioration by using 
      wetland plants both in a microcosm as well as natural/field condition. Heavymetal 
      contamination in aquatic ecosystems due to discharge of industrial effluents may 
      pose a serious threat to human health. Alkaline precipitation, ion exchange 
      columns, electrochemical removal, filtration, and membrane technologies are the 
      currently available technologies for heavy metal removal. These conventional 
      technologies are not economical and may produce adverse impacts on aquatic 
      ecosystems. Phytoremediation of metals is a cost-effective "green" technology 
      based on the use of specially selected metal-accumulating plants to remove toxic 
      metals from soils and water. Wetland plants are important tools for heavy metal 
      removal. The Ramsar convention, one of the earlier modern global conservation 
      treaties, was adopted at Ramsar, Iran, in 1971 and became effective in 1975. This 
      convention emphasized the wise use of wetlands and their resources. This review 
      mentions salient features of wetland ecosystems, their vegetation component, and 
      the pros and cons involved in heavy metal removal. Wetland plants are preferred 
      over other bio-agents due to their low cost, frequent abundance in aquatic 
      ecosystems, and easy handling. The extensive rhizosphere of wetland plants 
      provides an enriched culture zone for the microbes involved in degradation. The 
      wetland sediment zone provides reducing conditions that are conducive to the 
      metal removal pathway. Constructed wetlands proved to be effective for the 
      abatement of heavymetal pollution from acid mine drainage; landfill leachate; 
      thermal power; and municipal, agricultural, refinery, and chlor-alkali effluent. 
      the physicochemical properties of wetlands provide many positive attributes for 
      remediating heavy metals. Typha, Phragmites, Eichhornia, Azolla, Lemna, and other 
      aquatic macrophytes are some of the potent wetland plants for heavy metal 
      removal. Biomass disposal problem and seasonal growth of aquatic macrophytes are 
      some limitations in the transfer of phytoremediation technology from the 
      laboratory to the field. However, the disposed biomass of macrophytes may be used 
      for various fruitful applications. An ecosustainable model has been developed 
      through the author's various works, which may ameliorate some of the limitations. 
      The creation of more areas for phytoremediation may also aid in wetlands 
      conservation. Genetic engineering and biodiversity prospecting of endangered 
      wetland plants are important future prospects in this regard.

TI  - Phytophthora quercetorum sp. nov., a novel species isolated from eastern and

AB  - Isolates belonging to an undescribed Phytophthora species were frequently 
      recovered during an oak forest soil survey of Phytophthora species in eastern and 
      north-central USA in 2004. The species was isolated using an oak leaf baiting 
      method from rhizosphere soil samples collected from Quercus rubra, Q. macrocarpa, 
      and Q. phellos. This species is formally described as P. quercetorum. It is 
      homothallic and has aplerotic oogonia and paragynous antheridia. It produces 
      papillate sporangia (occasionally bipapillate) of ovoid-elongated shapes. Its 
      temperature optimum for growth is ca 22.5 degrees C with the upper limit of ca 
      32.5 degrees C. P. quercetorum differs from the morphologically related P. 
      quercina in producing distinct submerged colony-patterns, different 
      growth-temperature requirements, and oogonial shapes and sizes. Phylogenetic 
      analyses using seven nuclear loci supported P. quercetorum as a novel species 
      within clade 4, closely related to P. arecae, P. palmivora, P. megakarya, and P. 
      quercina.

TI  - The genome of Laccaria bicolor provides insights into mycorrhizal symbiosis.
PG  - 88-92
LID - 10.1038/nature06556 [doi]
AB  - Mycorrhizal symbioses--the union of roots and soil fungi--are universal in 
      terrestrial ecosystems and may have been fundamental to land colonization by 
      plants. Boreal, temperate and montane forests all depend on ectomycorrhizae. 
      Identification of the primary factors that regulate symbiotic development and 
      metabolic activity will therefore open the door to understanding the role of 
      ectomycorrhizae in plant development and physiology, allowing the full ecological 
      significance of this symbiosis to be explored. Here we report the genome sequence 
      of the ectomycorrhizal basidiomycete Laccaria bicolor (Fig. 1) and highlight gene 
      sets involved in rhizosphere colonization and symbiosis. This 65-megabase genome 
      assembly contains approximately 20,000 predicted protein-encoding genes and a 
      very large number of transposons and repeated sequences. We detected unexpected 
      genomic features, most notably a battery of effector-type small secreted proteins 
      (SSPs) with unknown function, several of which are only expressed in symbiotic 
      tissues. The most highly expressed SSP accumulates in the proliferating hyphae 
      colonizing the host root. The ectomycorrhizae-specific SSPs probably have a 
      decisive role in the establishment of the symbiosis. The unexpected observation 
      that the genome of L. bicolor lacks carbohydrate-active enzymes involved in 
      degradation of plant cell walls, but maintains the ability to degrade non-plant 
      cell wall polysaccharides, reveals the dual saprotrophic and biotrophic lifestyle 
      of the mycorrhizal fungus that enables it to grow within both soil and living 
      plant roots. The predicted gene inventory of the L. bicolor genome, therefore, 
      points to previously unknown mechanisms of symbiosis operating in biotrophic 
      mycorrhizal fungi. The availability of this genome provides an unparalleled 
      opportunity to develop a deeper understanding of the processes by which symbionts 
      interact with plants within their ecosystem to perform vital functions in the 
      carbon and nitrogen cycles that are fundamental to sustainable plant 
      productivity.

TI  - Comparing WHAM 6 and MINEQL+ 4.5 for the chemical speciation of Cu2+ in the 
      rhizosphere of forest soils.
PG  - 8104-10
AB  - Metal speciation data calculated by modeling could give useful information 
      regarding the fate of metals in the rhizospheric environment. However, no 
      comparative study has evaluated the relative accuracy of speciation models in 
      this microenvironment. Consequently, the present study evaluates the reliability 
      of free Cu ion (Cu2+) activity modeled by WHAM 6 and MINEQL+ 4.5 for 18 bulk and 
      18 rhizospheric soil samples collected in two Canadian forested areas located 
      near industrial facilities. The modeling of Cu speciation was performed on water 
      extracts using pH, dissolved organic carbon (DOC), major ions, and total 
      dissolved Al, Ca, Cu, Mg, and Zn concentrations as input data. Four scenarios 
      representing the composition of dissolved organic substances using fulvic, humic, 
      and acetic acids were derived from the literature and used in the modeling 
      exercise. Different scenarios were used to contrast soil components (rhizosphere 
      vs bulk) and soil pH levels (acidic vs neutral to alkaline). Reference Cu2+ 
      activity values measured by an ion-selective electrode varied between 0.39 and 41 
      nM. The model MINEQL+ 4.5 provided good predictions of Cu2+ activities 
      [root-mean-square residual (RMSR)= 0.37], while predictions from WHAM 6 were poor 
      (RMSR = 1.74) because they overestimated Cu complexation with DOC. Modeling with 
      WHAM 6 could be improved by adjusting the proportion of inert DOC and the 
      composition of DOC (RMSR = 0.94), but it remained weaker than predictions with 
      MINEQL+ 4.5. These results suggested that the discrepancies between speciation 
      models were attributed to differences in the binding capacity of humic substances 
      with Cu, where WHAM 6 appeared to be too aggressive. Therefore, we concluded that 
      chemical interactions occurring between Cu and DOC were key factors for an 
      accurate simulation of Cu speciation, especially in rhizospheric forest soils, 
      where high variation of the DOC concentration and composition are observed.

TI  - Forest soil metagenome gene cluster involved in antifungal activity expression in 
      Escherichia coli.
PG  - 723-30
AB  - Using two forest soils, we previously constructed two fosmid libraries containing 
      113,700 members in total. The libraries were screened to select active antifungal 
      clones using Saccharomyces cerevisiae as a target fungus. One clone from the 
      Yuseong pine tree rhizosphere soil library, pEAF66, showed S. cerevisiae growth 
      inhibition. Despite an intensive effort, active chemicals were not isolated. DNA 
      sequence analysis and transposon mutagenesis of pEAF66 revealed 39 open reading 
      frames (ORFs) and indicated that eight ORFs, probably in one transcriptional 
      unit, might be directly involved in the expression of antifungal activity in 
      Escherichia coli. The deduced amino acid sequences of eight ORFs were similar to 
      those of the core genes encoding type II family polyketide synthases, such as the 
      acyl carrier protein (ACP), ACP synthases, aminotransferase, and ACP reductase. 
      The gene cluster involved in antifungal activity was similar in organization to 
      the putative antibiotic production locus of Pseudomonas putida KT2440, although 
      we could not select a similar active clone from the KT2440 genomic DNA library in 
      E. coli. ORFs encoding ATP binding cassette transporters and membrane proteins 
      were located at both ends of the antifungal gene cluster. Upstream ORFs encoding 
      an IclR family response regulator and a LysR family response regulator were 
      involved in the positive regulation of antifungal gene expression. Our results 
      suggested the metagenomic approach as an alternative to search for novel 
      antifungal antibiotics from unculturable soil bacteria. This is the first report 
      of an antifungal gene cluster obtained from a soil metagenome using S. cerevisiae 
      as a target fungus.

TI  - Soil fertility and the impact of exotic invasion on microbial communities in 
      Hawaiian forests.
PG  - 55-63
AB  - Exotic plant invasions into Hawaiian montane forests have altered many important 
      nutrient cycling processes and pools. Across different ecosystems, researchers 
      are uncovering the mechanisms involved in how invasive plants impact the soil 
      microbial community-the primary mediator of soil nutrient cycling. We examined 
      whether the invasive plant, Hedychium gardnerianum, altered microbial community 
      composition in forests dominated by a native tree, Metrosideros polymorpha, under 
      varying soil nutrient limitations and soil fertility properties within forest 
      plots of the Hawaii long-term substrate age gradient (LSAG). Microbial community 
      lipid analysis revealed that when nutrient limitation (as determined by 
      aboveground net primary production [ANPP]) and soil fertility were taken into 
      account, plant species differentially altered soil microbial community 
      composition. Microbial community characteristics differed under invasive and 
      native plants primarily when N or P was added to the older, highly weathered, 
      P-limited soils. Long-term fertilization with N or P at the P-limited site led to 
      a significant increase in the relative abundance of the saprophytic fungal 
      indicator (18:2 omega 6c,9c) under the invasive plant. In the younger, N-limited 
      soils, plant species played a minor role in influencing soil microbial community 
      composition. We found that the general rhizosphere microbial community structure 
      was determined more by soil fertility than by plant species. This study indicates 
      that although the aggressive invasion of a nutrient-demanding, rapidly 
      decomposable, and invasive plant into Hawaiian forests had large impacts on soil 
      microbial decomposers, relatively little impact occurred on the overall soil 
      microbial community structure. Instead, soil nutrient conditions were more 
      important determinants of the overall microbial community structure within 
      Hawaii's montane forests.

TI  - Fertilization effects on fineroot biomass, rhizosphere microbes and respiratory 
      fluxes in hardwood forest soils.
PG  - 655-664

AB  - Fertilizer-induced reductions in CO(2) flux from soil ((F)CO(2)) in forests have 
      previously been attributed to decreased carbon allocation to roots, and decreased 
      decomposition as a result of nitrogen suppression of fungal activity. Here, we 
      present evidence that decreased microbial respiration in the rhizosphere may also 
      contribute to (F)CO(2) reductions in fertilized forest soils. Fertilization 
      reduced (F)CO(2) by 16-19% in 65-yr-old plantations of northern red oak (Quercus 
      rubra) and sugar maple (Acer saccharum), and in a natural 85-yr-old yellow birch 
      (Betula allegheniensis) stand. In oak plots, fertilization had no effects on fine 
      root biomass but reduced mycorrhizal colonization by 18% and microbial 
      respiration by 43%. In maple plots, fertilization reduced root biomass, 
      mycorrhizal colonization and microbial respiration by 22, 16 and 46%, 
      respectively. In birch plots, fertilization reduced microbial respiration by 36%, 
      but had variable effects on root biomass and mycorrhizal colonization. In plots 
      of all three species, fertilization effects on microbial respiration were greater 
      in rhizosphere than in bulk soil, possibly as a result of decreased rhizosphere 
      carbon flux from these species in fertile soils. Because rhizosphere processes 
      may influence nutrient availability and carbon storage in forest ecosystems, 
      future research is needed to better quantify rhizo-microbial contributions to 
      (F)CO(2).

TI  - No evidence of an impact on the rhizosphere diazotroph community by the 
      expression of Bacillus thuringiensis Cry1Ab toxin by Bt white spruce.
PG  - 6577-83
AB  - Nitrogen fixation is one of the most important roles played by soil bacterial 
      communities, as fixation supplies nitrogen to many ecosystems which are often N 
      limited. As impacts on this functional group of bacteria might harm the 
      ecosystem's health and reduce productivity, monitoring that particular group is 
      important. Recently, a field trial with Bt white spruce, which constitutively 
      expresses the Cry1Ab insecticidal toxin of Bacillus thuringiensis, was 
      established. The Bt white spruce was shown to be resistant to spruce budworm. We 
      investigated the possible impact of these genetically modified trees on soil 
      nitrogen-fixing bacterial communities. The trial consisted of untransformed 
      controls, GUS white spruce (transformed with the beta-glucuronidase gene), and 
      Bt/GUS white spruce (which constitutively expresses both the Cry1Ab toxin and 
      beta-glucuronidase) in a random design. Four years after planting, soil samples 
      from the control and the two treatments from plantation as well as from two 
      natural stands of white spruce were collected. Diazotroph diversity was assessed 
      by extracting soil genomic DNA and amplifying a region of the nitrogenase 
      reductase (nifH) gene, followed by cloning and sequencing. Analysis revealed that 
      nitrogen-fixing communities did not differ significantly among the untransformed 
      control, GUS white spruce, and Bt/GUS white spruce. Nevertheless, differences in 
      diazotroph diversity were observed between white spruce trees from the plantation 
      site and those from two natural stands, one of which grew only a few meters away 
      from the plantation. We therefore conclude, in the absence of evidence that the 
      presence of the B. thuringiensis cry1Ab gene had an effect on diazotroph 
      communities, that either site and/or field preparation prior to planting seems to 
      be more important in determining diazotroph community structure than the presence 
      of Bt white spruce.

TI  - Petroleum hydrocarbon contamination in boreal forest soils: a mycorrhizal 
      ecosystems perspective.
PG  - 213-40
AB  - The importance of developing multi-disciplinary approaches to solving problems 
      relating to anthropogenic pollution is now clearly appreciated by the scientific 
      community, and this is especially evident in boreal ecosystems exposed to 
      escalating threats of petroleum hydrocarbon (PHC) contamination through expanded 
      natural resource extraction activities. This review aims to synthesize 
      information regarding the fate and behaviour of PHCs in boreal forest soils in 
      both ecological and sustainable management contexts. From this, we hope to 
      evaluate potential management strategies, identify gaps in knowledge and guide 
      future research. Our central premise is that mycorrhizal systems, the ubiquitous 
      root symbiotic fungi and associated food-web communities, occupy the structural 
      and functional interface between decomposition and primary production in northern 
      forest ecosystems (i.e. underpin survival and productivity of the ecosystem as a 
      whole), and, as such, are an appropriate focal point for such a synthesis. We 
      provide pertinent basic information about mycorrhizas, followed by insights into 
      the ecology of ecto- and ericoid mycorrhizal systems. Next, we review the fate 
      and behaviour of PHCs in forest soils, with an emphasis on interactions with 
      mycorrhizal fungi and associated bacteria. Finally, we summarize implications for 
      ecosystem management. Although we have gained tremendous insights into 
      understanding linkages between ecosystem functions and the various aspects of 
      mycorrhizal diversity, very little is known regarding rhizosphere communities in 
      PHC-contaminated soils. This makes it difficult to translate ecological knowledge 
      into environmental management strategies. Further research is required to 
      determine which fungal symbionts are likely to survive and compete in various 
      ecosystems, whether certain fungal - plant associations gain in ecological 
      importance following contamination events, and how PHC contamination may 
      interfere with processes of nutrient acquisition and exchange and metabolic 
      processes. Research is also needed to assess whether the metabolic capacity for 
      intrinsic decomposition exists in these ecosystems, taking into account 
      ecological variables such as presence of other organisms (and their involvement 
      in syntrophic biodegradation), bioavailability and toxicity of mixtures of PHCs, 
      and physical changes to the soil environment.

TI  - Characteristics of the microbial community in rhizosphere of Camptotheca 
      acuminata cultured with exotic invasive plant Eupatorium adenophorum.
PG  - 22-30
AB  - The traditional culture-dependent plate counting and culture-independent 
      small-subunit-ribosomal RNA gene-targeted molecular techniques, Single-Strand 
      Conformation Polymorphism (SSCP) and terminal Restriction Fragment Length 
      Polymorphism (tRFLP) combined with 16S rDNA clone library were adopted to 
      investigate the impacts of secretion from Camptotheca acuminata (abbreviated to 
      Ca) roots on the quantities and structure of eukaryotic microbes and bacteria in 
      the rhizosphere, and the possibility that Ca controls exotic invasive plant 
      Eupatorium adenophorum (Ea). The counting results indicated that the number of 
      bacteria increased in turn in rhizospheres of Ea, Ca-Ea mixed culture and Ca, 
      while that of eukaryotic microbes decreased. PCR-SSCP profiles showed eukaryotic 
      microbial bands (corresponding to biodiversity) in rhizosphere of Ea were more 
      complex than those of Ca and CE. Meristolohmannia sp., Termitomyces sp. and 
      Rhodophyllus sp. were the dominant populations in the rhizosphere of Ca. 
      Bacterial terminal restriction fragments (TRFs) profiles showed no difference 
      among three kinds of rhizospheres, and the sequences of the 16S rDNA clone 
      library from Ca rhizospheres were distributed in 10 known phyla, in which phylum 
      Proteobacteria were the absolute dominant group and accounted for 24.71% of the 
      cloned sequences (delta-Proteobacteria accounted for up to 17.65%), and phyla 
      Acidobacteria and Bacteroidetes accounted for 16.47% and 10.59% of the cloned 
      sequences, respectively. In addition, high performance liquid chromatography 
      detected a trace amount of camptothecin and hydroxycamptothecin in the 
      rhizospheric soil of Ca and CE, but examined neither camptothecin nor 
      hydroxycamptothecin in rhizospheric soil of Ea. Therefore, invasion and diffusion 
      of Ea evidently depended on distinguishing the eukaryotic community structure, 
      but not on that of the bacterial pattern. Ca was able to alter the eukaryotic 
      community structure of invasive Ea by secreting camptothecin and 
      hydroxycamptothecin into rhizospheres, and may benefit the control of overspread 
      of Ea. This study provided theoretical evidence for rhizospheric microbial 
      aspects on substituting Ca for Ea.

TI  - First Report of Trichodorus similis from the Czech Republic (Nematoda: 
      Trichodoridae).
PG  - 228
LID - 10.1094/PDIS-91-2-0228B [doi]
AB  - Members of the Trichodoridae can cause substantial crop losses directly by 
      feeding on plant roots and indirectly as vectors of tobraviruses; both vector and 
      virus are polyphagous. Although trichodorid nematodes are important pests of 
      agricultural crops, no data are available on the presence or extent of these 
      nematodes in the Czech Republic. In June 2005, three soil samples from the 
      rhizosphere of a Quercus sp. at Cerveny Vrch yielded a population of Trichodorus 
      similis Seinhorst, 1963. Specimens were extracted from soil by a 
      decanting-sieving method, heat killed, and fixed in triethanolamine formalin 
      (TAF), and processed and mounted in anhydrous glycerin. Nematodes were identified 
      by morphological and morphometrical characters (2). Classical identification of 
      these nematodes was further verified by molecular study. A single, male specimen 
      was temporarily mounted in distilled water on a glass slide and relaxed with 
      gentle heat. Measurements and photographs were taken, and the specimen was 
      transferred to a 0.5-ml Eppendorf tube containing 0.25 M NaOH. Total genomic DNA 
      was prepared by a rapid technique (4). Morphometric data of the male specimen 
      used for DNA study are: body length 867 mum; body width 81 mum; onchiostyle length 
      44 mum; spicule length 36 mum; distance of anterior cervical papilla (CP)1 from 
      anterior end 39 mum, CP1 to CP2 25 mum, CP2 to CP3 22 mum; posterior precloacal 
      supplement (SP1) to cloacal opening 27 mum, distance SP1 to SP2 32 mum, distance 
      SP2 to SP3 39 mum. The following primers were used in the PCR reaction: 
      species-specific sense primer SIMIREV2 (5'-CACTCGTCGGACTCAAACC-3') and universal 
      antisense primer UNIVERSAL (5'-CCCGTCGCTACTACCGATT-3') (1). A single fragment of 
      approximately 452 bp was amplified. The D2 and D3 expansion regions of the large 
      subunit 28S rDNA were amplified using the primer D2A 
      (5'-ACAAGTACCGTGAGGGAAAGTTG-3') and D3B (5'-TCGGAAGGAACCAGCTACTA-3' (3). The 
      region was sequenced after purification of PCR products from the gel slice with a 
      Qiagen gel purification kit (Qiagen Inc., Valencia, CA). The obtained sequence 
      was deposited in Genbank (Accession No. DQ832183). The obtained sequence was 
      compared by BLAST in NCBI and the results showed strong similarities with T. 
      similis (Accession No. AM180730). To our knowledge, this is the first report of 
      T. similis associated with a deciduous forest in the Czech Republic. Taking into 
      account the agricultural importance of trichodorids and tobraviruses as plant 
      pathogens, there is a need for a comprehensive survey of these taxa in the Czech 
      Republic. The damage level threshold is in the case of virus vector species 
      equivalent to a single nematode. Therefore, information on these plant parasites 
      would be useful for developing nematode management strategies. References: (1) K.

TI  - Survival of Escherichia coli O157:H7 in the rhizosphere of maize grown in 
      waste-amended soil.
PG  - 319-26
AB  - AIMS: To assess whether the persistence of Escherichia coli O157:H7 in soil 
      amended with cattle slurry and ovine stomach content waste is affected by the 
      presence of a maize rhizosphere. METHODS AND RESULTS: Cattle slurry and ovine 
      stomach content waste were inoculated with E. coli O157:H7. Wastes were then 
      applied to soil cores with and without established maize plants. The pathogen 
      survived in soil for over 5 weeks, although at significantly greater numbers in 
      soil receiving stomach content waste in comparison to cattle slurry. Persistence 
      of the pathogen in soil was unaffected by the presence of a rhizosphere. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Other factors may be more influential in regulating E. coli O157:H7 
      persistence in waste-amended soil than the presence or absence of a rhizosphere; 
      however, waste type did have significant affect on the survival of E. coli 
      O157:H7 in such soil. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: Escherichia coli 
      O157:H7 can be present within animal-derived organic wastes that are routinely 
      spread on land. Introduced measures with regards to such waste disposal may 
      decrease exposure to the organism; however, the persistence of E. coli O157:H7 
      for considerable periods in waste-amended soil may still pose some risk for both 
      human and animal infection. This study has shown that whilst survival of E. coli 
      O157:H7 in waste-amended soil is not significantly affected by the presence or 
      absence of a maize rhizosphere; it may vary significantly with waste type. This 
      may have implications for land and waste management.

TI  - Occurrence of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi in bromeliad species from the tropical 
      Atlantic forest biome in Brazil.
PG  - 235-240
LID - 10.1007/s00572-006-0090-5 [doi]
AB  - The mycorrhizal status of epiphytic, rupicolous, and terrestrial bromeliad 
      species from the Brazilian Atlantic Rain Forest has been examined. Roots of 13 
      species of bromeliads were analyzed for the presence of mycorrhizal structures 
      such as arbuscules, hyphae, and vesicles as well as other fungal structures. 
      Rhizosphere soil was sampled to identify arbuscular mycorrhizal fungal (AMF) 
      species associated only with terrestrial bromeliad species. Most specimens 
      collected were epiphytic bromeliads in the genera Aechmea, Bilbergia, Nidularium, 
      Tillandsia, and Vriesea. Differentiating structures of AMF were found in only 
      three species of bromeliads. The pattern of mycorrhizal colonization was mainly 
      internal, and external mycelium and arbuscules were observed only in the 
      terrestrial Nidularium procerum. Root endophytes with dark brown septate 
      mycelium, thin external hyphae, and Rhizoctonia-like sclerotia were also detected 
      in some root segments. A total of ten spore morphotypes were recovered from the 
      rhizosphere of N. procerum, with Acaulospora mellea, A. foveata, and Glomus sp. 
      being the most common species recovered. Our study demonstrated that most of the 
      epiphytic species are not associated with AMF. We attribute this mainly to the 
      exposed bare root conditions found in epiphytic bromeliads.

TI  - [Rhizosphere effects of Pinus sylvestris var. mongolica on soil phosphorus 
      transformation].
PG  - 1377-81
AB  - To understand the phosphorus (P) mobilization mechanism of Mongolian pine (Pinus 
      sylvestris var. mongolica) on a P-deficient semi-arid sandy soil of northern 
      China, this paper compared the P fractions and acid phosphomonoesterase (AP) 
      activity in the bulk and rhizosphere soils under different age Mongolian pine 
      plantations. The results showed that when compared with the bulk soil, the 
      organic C, labile organic P, and organic C/P ratio increased significantly, 
      microbial and AP activities improved, and organic P mineralization accelerated in 
      the rhizosphere soil. Root activity of the Mongolian pine significantly increased 
      the bioavailability of soil P, and accelerated the shift of organic P and Ca-P to 
      Fe-P and Al-P. The rhizosphere effects on soil P in different forms enhanced with 
      stand age, whereas in adverse on AP activity. The bulk and rhizosphere soil had 
      the similar trend in the dynamics of its P fractions with stand age. Soil total P 
      pool reduced gradually while labile P pool increased with stand age. It should be 
      essential to protect forest floor to replenish soil P pool and guarantee a 
      long-term soil P supply.

TI  - Changes in the community of ectomycorrhizal fungi and increased fine root number 
      under adult beech trees chronically fumigated with double ambient ozone 
      concentration.
PG  - 279-87
AB  - Forest soils are an important but under-studied part of forest ecosystems. The 
      effects of O(3) on below-ground processes in a mature forest have only received 
      limited attention so far. In our study, we have analysed the community of 
      ectomycorrhizal fungi and beech fine root dynamics over two growing seasons (2003 
      - 2004) in a 70-year old mixed spruce-beech forest stand, in which two groups of 
      five adult beech trees were either fumigated by 2 x ambient ozone concentration 
      or used as control. The main difference between previous studies and our approach 
      was that previous studies were performed on seedlings in pot experiments or in 
      closed or open top chambers, and not IN SITU, in a mature forest stand. Although 
      beech is a relatively unresponsive species to tropospheric O(3), we found a 
      pronounced effect of 2 x O(3) on the number of vital ectomycorrhizal root tips 
      and non-turgescent fine roots. Both categories of roots were significantly 
      increased when compared to controls in two consecutive years at each sampling 
      event. The number of types of ectomycorrhizae and species richness increased in 
      2004, but not in the extremely dry year 2003. We hypothesised that the observed 
      changes might be an expression of a transitional state in below-ground succession 
      of niches caused by an O(3) induced effect on carbon allocation to roots and the 
      rhizosphere. We have detected changes in ectomycorrhizal species level, however 
      Shannon-Weavers species diversity index and percentage of types of 
      ectomycorrhizae did not change significantly in any sampling year thus indicating 
      our results cannot be unequivocally explained by summer drought in year 2003 or 
      by O(3) exposure alone.

TI  - Use of multiplex terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism for rapid and 
      simultaneous analysis of different components of the soil microbial community.
PG  - 7278-85
AB  - A multiplex terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism (M-TRFLP) 
      fingerprinting method was developed and validated for simultaneous analysis of 
      the diversity and community structure of two or more microbial taxa (up to four 
      taxa). The reproducibility and robustness of the method were examined using soil 
      samples collected from different habitats. DNA was PCR amplified separately from 
      soil samples using individual taxon-specific primers for bacteria, archaea, and 
      fungi. The same samples were also subjected to a multiplex PCR with the primers 
      for all three taxa. The terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism 
      profiles generated for the two sets of PCR products were almost identical not 
      only in terms of the presence of peaks but also in terms of the relative peak 
      intensity. The M-TRFLP method was then used to investigate rhizosphere bacterial, 
      fungal, and rhizobial/agrobacterial communities associated with the dwarf shrub 
      Calluna vulgaris growing in either open moorland, a mature pine forest, or a 
      transition zone between these two habitats containing naturally regenerating pine 
      trees. Rhizosphere microbial communities associated with Vaccinium myrtillus 
      collected from the native pine forest were also investigated. In this study, 
      individual PCR products from the three taxa were also pooled before restriction 
      digestion and fragment size analysis. The terminal restriction fragment length 
      polymorphism profiles obtained with PCR products amplified individually and with 
      multiplexed and pooled PCR products were found to be consistent with each other 
      in terms of the number, position, and relative intensity of peaks. The results 
      presented here confirm that M-TRFLP analysis is a highly reproducible and robust 
      molecular tool for simultaneous investigation of multiple taxa, which allows more 
      complete and higher resolution of microbial communities to be obtained more 
      rapidly and economically.

TI  - Characterization of culturable bacterial populations associating with Pinus 
      sylvestris--Suillus bovinus mycorrhizospheres.
PG  - 769-78
AB  - Bacterial isolations were carried out on Pinus sylvestris--Suillus bovinus 
      mycorrhizospheres obtained directly from boreal pine forest. When samples were 
      taken during dry weather, the numbers of bacterial colony-forming units were 
      significantly higher in uncolonized short roots and external mycelia than in 
      mycorrhizal roots and soil outside the mycorrhizosphere. In contrast, the 
      colony-forming unit counts were similar in all hypogeous samples after rainy 
      weather. Culturable bacteria were absent from most Suillus bovinus sporocarps. 
      The bacteria isolated from all types of mycorr hizo sphere samples, i.e. short 
      roots, mycorrhizal roots, and external mycelia, consisted primarily of 
      Burkholderia spp., whereas most isolates from soil outside the mycorrhizosphere 
      were identified as Paenibacillus spp. This study shows that mycorrhizal external 
      mycelia can expand the habitat favourable for common rhizosphere bacteria into 
      the soil far from the immediate rhizosphere. Some of these bacteria may help the 
      trees with nitrogen acquisition, since potentially diazotrophic bacteria 
      harbouring nitrogenase reductase (nifH) genes were isolated from mycorrhizal root 
      tips.

      Pseudomonas putida (B0) isolated from a sub-alpine location in the Indian Central 
      Himalaya.
PG  - 102-7
AB  - The morphological, biochemical, and physiological characteristics of a phosphate 
      solubilizing and antagonistic bacterial strain, designated as B0, isolated from a 
      sub-alpine Himalayan forest site have been described. The isolate is gram 
      negative, rod shaped, 0.8 x 1.6 microm in size, and psychrotrophic in nature that 
      could grow from 0 to 35 degrees C (optimum temp. 25 degrees C). It exhibited 
      tolerance to a wide pH range (3-12; optimum 8.0) and salt concentration up to 4% 
      (w/v). Although it was sensitive to kanamycin, gentamicin, and streptomycin (<10 
      microg mL(-1)), it showed resistance to higher concentrations of ampicillin, 
      penicillin, and carbenicillin (>1000 microg mL(-1)). The isolate showed maximum 
      similarity with Pseudomonas putida based on 16S rRNA analysis. It solubilized 
      tricalcium phosphate under in vitro conditions. The phosphate solubilization was 
      estimated along a temperature range (4-28 degrees C), and maximum activity (247 
      microg mL(-1)) was recorded at 21 degrees C after 15 days of incubation. The 
      phosphate solubilizing activity coincided with a concomitant decrease in pH of 
      the medium. The isolate also exhibited antifungal activity against 
      phytopathogenic fungi in Petri dish assays and produced chitinase, 
      ss-l,3-glucanase, salicylic acid, siderophore, and hydrogen cyanide. The plant 
      growth promotion and antifungal properties were demonstrated through a 
      maize-based bioassay under greenhouse conditions. Although the bacterial 
      inoculation was found to result in significant increment in plant biomass, it 
      stimulated bacterial and suppressed fungal counts in the rhizosphere. The present 
      study is important with respect to enumerating microbial diversity of the colder 
      regions as well as understanding the potential biotechnological applications of 
      native microbes.

TI  - Paracoccus bengalensis sp. nov., a novel sulfur-oxidizing chemolithoautotroph 
      from the rhizospheric soil of an Indian tropical leguminous plant.
PG  - 396-403
AB  - Paracoccus versutus-like isolates from the rhizosphere of Clitoria ternatea, a 
      slender leguminous herb (family--Papilionaceae), found ubiquitously in waste 
      places and village forests of the Lower Gangetic plains of India, presented a 
      case of graduated infraspecific variation that was capped by the identification 
      of a new species Paracoccus bengalensis (type strain JJJ(T) = LMG 22700(T) = MTCC 
      7003(T)). The diverged phenetic and genetic structure of these sulfur-oxidizing 
      chemolithoautotrophs presented a case of apparent nonconformity of 16S rRNA gene 
      sequence similarities with results of DNA-DNA hybridization. Despite high 16S 
      rRNA gene sequence similarity with P. versutus one of the newly isolated strains, 
      viz., JJJ(T) was identified as a new species of Paracoccus by virtue of its 
      explicitly low DNA-DNA hybridization (42-45%) with the type strain of the closest 
      species P. versutus (), distinct G + C content (65.3 mol%), physiological and 
      biochemical differences amounting to <60% phenetic similarity with strains of P. 
      versutus as well as new isolates akin to the species. The newly described species 
      also had a unique fatty acid profile that was distinguished by the absence of 
      18:1 omega9c, unique possession of Summed feature 3 (16:1omega7c & 15:0 iso 
      2-OH), 19:0 10 methyl, and a much higher concentration of 19:0 cycloomega8c.

TI  - Distribution of Al-, Fe- and Mn-pools and their correlation in soils from two 
      acid deposition small catchments in Hunan, China.
PG  - 2468-76
AB  - Distribution of Al-, Fe- and Mn-pools was investigated in five forest soil 
      profiles (consisting of four horizons) in each of two Hunan catchments (BLT and 
      LKS) where acid deposition has been considered critical. Al- and Fe-pools were 
      higher in BLT than those in LKS, but Mn-pools much lower in BLT. Mn-pools vary 
      from topsoils to bottom soils, but there are different trends for different Mn 
      speciation. Al- and Fe-pools, except amorphous Fe(ox), were positively correlated 
      to contents of soil organic matter (OM) showed by the loss on ignition in the two 
      catchments. Accumulation of Al- and Fe-pools may occur in the area where soil 
      organic matter was enriched (e.g. in top soil and rhizosphere soil). However, no 
      direct correlation is observed between Mn and OM. Acidic atmospheric deposition 
      may affect transforming among speciations of Al-, Fe- and Mn-pools and leaching 
      of soil Al, Fe and Mn through formation of soluble organo-metal dissolved Al 
      which was potentially toxic, increased. There were significant correlations 
      between Al-pools complexes or change of oxidation-reduction conditions. Mn(ex) 
      (exchangeable Mn) and Mn(ox) (amorphous and organic Mn) were highly linearly 
      correlation with soil pH values at LKS but at BLT. Under acid deposition, the 
      availability of the nutrient Fe increased with the amount of dissolved Al, which 
      was potentially toxic, in the two catchments. There are no significant 
      correlations between Al(ex) (exchangeable Al) and Mn(ex), Fe(ex) (exchangeable 
      Fe) and Mn(ex) in this work, indicating potentially toxic Mn increase seldom 
      accompanying with Al increase in the two catchments.

TI  - Labile zinc concentration and free copper ion activity in the rhizosphere of 
      forest soils.
PG  - 635-42
AB  - Water-soluble and acid-extractable Cu and Zn, water-soluble organic carbon 
      (WSOC), pH, differential pulse anodic stripping voltammetry-labile Zn (ZnL), Zn2+ 
      activity (Windemere humic aqueous model [WHAM]; http://chess.ensmp.fr/ 
      chemsites.html), and Cu2+ activity with an ion-selective electrode were compared 
      between the rhizosphere and the bulk components of nine acidic forest sites from 
      southeastern Canada. At all sites, the WSOC contents were higher in the 
      rhizosphere than in the bulk component. Acidity was also higher in the 
      rhizosphere, although pH differences were significant at only five sites. The 
      concentrations of Zn in water extracts and ZnL contents (at six sites) were 
      higher in the rhizosphere, whereas acid-extractable Zn was only marginally 
      increased in the rhizosphere. Calculations with WHAM indicated that free Zn2+ ion 
      activities were higher in the rhizosphere than in the bulk soil but that the 
      fraction of total dissolved Zn in water extracts that is present as free Zn2+ did 
      not differ significantly between the two components. The concentration of Cu in 
      the water extract was higher in the rhizosphere for all sites, but 
      acid-extractable Cu levels did not differ. The fraction of water-soluble Cu 
      present as Cu2+ was higher in the bulk soil, although Cu2+ activities did not 
      significantly vary with proximity to roots. These results showed that the 
      processes acting in the rhizosphere of forest soils strongly affected the 
      concentrations of dissolved Zn and Cu and that this microenvironment should be 
      considered when estimating the bioavailability and the ecological risks of metals 
      in soils.

TI  - Microbial responses to long-term N deposition in a semiarid grassland.
PG  - 90-8
AB  - Nitrogen (N) enrichment of the biosphere is an expanding problem to which arid 
      ecosystems may be particularly sensitive. In semiarid grasslands, scarce 
      precipitation uncouples plant and microbial activities, and creates within the 
      soil a spatial mosaic of rhizosphere and cyanobacterial crust communities. We 
      investigated the impact of elevated N deposition on these soil microbial 
      communities at a grama-dominated study site located incentral New Mexico (USA). 
      The study plots were established in 1995 and receive 10 kg ha(-1) year(-1) of 
      supplemental N in the form of NH(4)NO(3). Soil samples were collected in July 
      2004, following 2 years of severe drought, and again in March 2005 following a 
      winter of record high precipitation. Soils were assayed for potential activities 
      of 20 extracellular enzymes and N(2)O production. The rhizosphere and 
      crust-associated soils had peptidase and peroxidase potentials that were extreme 
      in relation to those of temperate soils. N addition enhanced glycosidase and 
      phosphatase activities and depressed peptidase. In contrast to temperate forest 
      soils, oxidative enzyme activity did not respond to N treatment. Across sampling 
      dates, extracellular enzyme activity responses correlated with inorganic N 
      concentrations. N(2)O generation did not vary significantly with soil cover or N 
      treatment. Microbial responses to N deposition in this semiarid grassland were 
      distinct from those of forest ecosystems and appear to be modulated by inorganic 
      N accumulation, which is linked to precipitation patterns.

TI  - Short term effects of ozone on the plant-rhizosphere-bulk soil system of young 
      beech trees.
PG  - 728-36
AB  - Plant growth largely depends on microbial community structure and function in the 
      rhizosphere. In turn, microbial communities in the rhizosphere rely on 
      carbohydrates provided by the host plant. This paper presents the first study on 
      ozone effects in the plant-rhizosphere-bulk soil system of 4-year-old beech trees 
      using outdoor lysimeters as a research platform. The lysimeters were filled with 
      homogenized soil from the corresponding horizons of a forest site, thus 
      minimizing field heterogeneity. Four lysimeters were treated with ambient ozone 
      (1 x O3) and four with double ambient ozone concentrations (2 x O3; restricted to 
      150 ppb). In contrast to senescence, which was almost unaffected by ozone 
      treatment, both the photochemical quantum yield of photosystem II (PSII) and leaf 
      gas exchange were reduced (11 - 45 %) under the elevated O3 regime. However, due 
      to large variation between the plants, no statistically significant O3 effect was 
      found. Even though the amount of primary metabolites, such as sugar and starch, 
      was not influenced by elevated O3 concentrations, the reduced photosynthetic 
      performance was reflected in leaf biochemistry in the form of a reduction in 
      soluble phenolic metabolites. The rhizosphere microbial community also responded 
      to the O3 treatment. Both community structure and function were affected, with a 
      tendency towards a lower diversity and a significant reduction in the potential 
      nutrient turnover. In contrast, litter degradation was unaffected by the 
      fumigation, indicating that in situ microbial functionality of the bulk soil did 
      not change.

TI  - Assessment of the diversity of Paenibacillus species in environmental samples by 
      a novel rpoB-based PCR-DGGE method.
PG  - 317-28
AB  - A specific PCR system based on the gene encoding the RNA polymerase beta subunit, 
      rpoB, was developed for amplification and denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis 
      (DGGE) fingerprinting of Paenibacillus communities in environmental samples. This 
      gene has been previously proven to be a powerful identification tool for the 
      discrimination of species within the genus Paenibacillus and could avoid the 
      limitations of 16S rRNA-based phylogenetic analysis. Initially, the PCR system 
      based on universal rpoB primers were used to amplify DNAs of different 
      Paenibacillus species. A new reverse primer (rpoBPAEN) was further designed based 
      on an insertion of six nucleotides in the Paenibacillus sequences analyzed. This 
      semi-nested PCR system was evaluated for specificity using DNAs isolated from 27 
      Paenibacillus species belonging to different 16S rRNA-based phylogenetic groups 
      and seven non-Paenibacillus species. The non-Paenibacillus species were not 
      amplified using this PCR approach and one group of Paenibacillus species 
      consisting of strains without the six-base insert also were not amplified; these 
      latter strains were found to be distinct based on 16S rRNA gene phylogeny. In 
      addition, a clone library was generated from the rpoB fragments amplified from 
      two Brazilian soil types (Cerrado and Forest) and all 62 clones sequenced were 
      closely related to one of the 22 sequences from Paenibacillus previously obtained 
      in this study. To assess the diversity of Paenibacillus species in Cerrado and 
      Forest soils and in the rhizosphere of different cultivars of maize, a PCR-DGGE 
      system was used. The Paenibacillus DGGE fingerprints showed a clear distinction 
      between communities of Paenibacillus in Forest and Cerrado soils and rhizosphere 
      samples clustered along Cerrado soil. Profiles of cultivars CMS22 and CMS36 
      clustered together, with only 53% of similarity to CMS11 and CMS04. The results 
      presented here demonstrate the potential use of the rpoB-based 
      Paenibacillus-specific PCR-DGGE method for studying the diversity of 
      Paenibacillus populations in natural environments.

TI  - Natural formation and degradation of chloroacetic acids and volatile 
      organochlorines in forest soil--challenges to understanding.
PG  - 233-44
AB  - GOAL, SCOPE AND BACKGROUND: The anthropogenic environmental emissions of 
      chloroacetic acids and volatile organochlorines have been under scrutiny in 
      recent years because the two compound groups are suspected to contribute to 
      forest dieback and stratospheric ozone destruction, respectively. The two 
      organochlorine groups are linked because the atmospheric photochemical oxidation 
      of some volatile organochlorine compounds is one source of phytotoxic 
      chloroacetic acids in the environment. Moreover, both groups are produced in 
      higher amounts by natural chlorination of organic matter, e.g. by soil 
      microorganisms, marine macroalgae and salt lake bacteria, and show similar 
      metabolism pathways. Elucidating the origin and fate of these organohalogens is 
      necessary to implement actions to counteract environmental problems caused by 
      these compounds. MAIN FEATURES: While the anthropogenic sources of chloroacetic 
      acids and volatile organochlorines are relatively well-known and within human 
      control, knowledge of relevant natural processes is scarce and fragmented. This 
      article reviews current knowledge on natural formation and degradation processes 
      of chloroacetic acids and volatile organochlorines in forest soils, with 
      particular emphasis on processes in the rhizosphere, and discusses future studies 
      necessary to understand the role of forest soils in the formation and degradation 
      of these compounds. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: Reviewing the present knowledge of 
      the natural formation and degradation processes of chloroacetic acids and 
      volatile organochlorines in forest soil has revealed gaps in knowledge regarding 
      the actual mechanisms behind these processes. In particular, there remains 
      insufficient quantification of reliable budgets and rates of formation and 
      degradation of chloroacetic acids and volatile organochlorines in forest soil 
      (both biotic and abiotic processes) to evaluate the strength of forest ecosystems 
      regarding the emission and uptake of chloroacetic acids and volatile 
      organochlorines, both on a regional scale and on a global scale. CONCLUSION: It 
      is concluded that the overall role of forest soil as a source and/or sink for 
      chloroacetic acids and volatile organochlorines is still unclear; the available 
      laboratory and field data reveal only bits of the puzzle. Detailed knowledge of 
      the natural degradation and formation processes in forest soil is important to 
      evaluate the strength of forest ecosystems for the emission and uptake of 
      chloroacetic acids and volatile organochlorines, both on a regional scale and on 
      a global scale. RECOMMENDATION AND PERSPECTIVE: As the natural formation and 
      degradation processes of chloroacetic acids and volatile organochlorines in 
      forest soil can be influenced by human activities, evaluation of the extent of 
      this influence will help to identify what future actions are needed to reduce 
      human influences and thus prevent further damage to the environment and to human 
      health caused by these compounds.

TI  - Separating rhizosphere respiration from total soil respiration in two larch 
      plantations in northeastern China.
PG  - 1187-95
AB  - The potential capacity of soil to sequester carbon in response to global warming 
      is strongly regulated by the ratio of rhizosphere respiration to respiration by 
      soil microbial decomposers, because of their different temperature sensitivities. 
      To quantify relative contributions of rhizosphere respiration to total soil 
      respiration as influenced by forest stand development, we conducted a trenching 
      study in two larch (Larix gmelini (Rupr.) Rupr.) plantations, aged 17 and 31 
      years, in northeastern China. Four plots in each plantation were randomly 
      selected and trenched in early May 2001. Soil surface CO2 effluxes both inside 
      and outside the plots were measured from May 2001 to August 2002. Soil 
      respiration (i.e., the CO2 effluxes outside the trenched plots) varied similarly 
      in the two plantations from 0.8 micromol m(-2) s(-1) in winter to 6.0 micromol 
      m(-2) s(-1) in summer. Rhizosphere respiration (i.e., CO2 efflux outside the 
      trenched plots minus that inside the plots) varied from 0.2 to 2.0 micromol m(-2) 
      s(-1) in the old forest and from 0.3 to 4.0 micromol m(-2) s(-1) in the young 
      forest over the seasons. Rhizosphere respiration, on average, accounted for 25% 
      of soil respiration in the old forest and 65% in the young forest. Rhizosphere 
      and soil respiration were significantly correlated with soil temperature but not 
      with soil water content. We conclude that the role forests play in regulating 
      climate change may depend on their age.

TI  - [Effects of Dipterocarpaceae on arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi].
PG  - 341-4
AB  - An investigation was carried out on the colonization percentage, spore density, 
      relative abundance, occurrence frequency, and species richness of arbuscular 
      mycorrhizal (AM) fungi on 4 species of Dipterocarpaceae trees grown both in 
      natural forests in Yunnan and Hainan Provinces and in greenhouse pots. The 
      results showed that all dipterocarp species were able to form AM, the 
      colonization rates ranged from 30.6% to 45.3%, 37% on average. Hopea hainanensis 
      (Dipterocarpacea) seedlings without AM fungal colonization were cultivated in 
      pots with soil collected from Dipterocarpacea rhizosphere, and harvested a year 
      later. The colonization rate of the seedlings ranged from 10.6% to 20.3%, 14.2% 
      on average, indicating the significant effect of host plants on AM fungi 
      frequency. The relative abundance of Glomu, Acaulospora and Gigaspora also varied 
      with host plants. It was concluded that the dominant AM fungi in the rhizospheric 
      soil of dipterocarp plants were Acaulospora spp. and Glomus spp. Using the same 
      species of Dipterocarpacea as host plants might promote the growth and 
      development of AM fungi, and increase the AM diversity.

TI  - Genetic mosaics in the massive persisting rhizosphere colony "shiro" of the 
      ectomycorrhizal basidiomycete Tricholoma matsutake.
PG  - 505-12
AB  - The ectomycorrhizal basidiomycete Tricholoma matsutake produces commercially 
      valuable fruit bodies "matsutake" on a massive persisting rhizosphere aggregate 
      of mycelia and mycorrhizas called "shiro." Using inter-retrotransposon amplified 
      polymorphism analysis, we attempted to explore the potential diversity within the 
      population of T. matsutake isolated from small Pinus densiflora woodlands located 
      in various parts of Japan. In general, random phylogenetic relationship was noted 
      among T. matsutake tested. The population from each limited sampling area was 
      highly heterogeneous. Even some isolates from fruit bodies produced in the same 
      shiro and those from spores in the same fruit bodies were found to be genetically 
      diverse, indicating the occurrence of genetic mosaics in shiro. In a mosaic 
      shiro, heterologous genets produced their fruit bodies concurrently. Data 
      suggested that the dispersal of spores through sexual reproduction may have been 
      more prevalent than generally accepted in T. matsutake to bring mosaicism and 
      coordination of heterologous genets within the shiro. Implementation of 
      management taking such diversity into consideration is urgently needed for the 
      restoration of devastated matsutake fields in Japan. Exploration of individual 
      clones in mosaic fungal resources that promote colonization and fruit body 
      production is necessary for it.

TI  - Ectomycorrhizal symbiosis affects functional diversity of rhizosphere fluorescent 
      pseudomonads.
PG  - 317-28
AB  - Here we characterized the effect of the ectomycorrhizal symbiosis on the 
      genotypic and functional diversity of soil Pseudomonas fluorescens populations 
      and analysed its possible consequences in terms of plant nutrition, development 
      and health. Sixty strains of P. fluorescens were isolated from the bulk soil of a 
      forest nursery, the ectomycorrhizosphere and the ectomycorrhizas of the Douglas 
      fir (Pseudostuga menziesii) seedlings-Laccaria bicolor S238N. They were 
      characterized in vitro with the following criteria: ARDRA, phosphate 
      solubilization, siderophore, HCN and AIA production, genes of N2-fixation and 
      antibiotic synthesis, in vitro confrontation with a range of phytopathogenic and 
      ectomycorrhizal fungi, effect on the Douglas fir-L. bicolor symbiosis. For most 
      of these criteria, we demonstrated that the ectomycorrhizosphere significantly 
      structures the P. fluorescens populations and selects strains potentially 
      beneficial to the symbiosis and to the plant. This prompts us to propose the 
      ectomycorrhizal symbiosis as a true microbial complex where multitrophic 
      interactions take place. Moreover it underlines the fact that this symbiosis has 
      an indirect positive effect on plant growth, via its selective pressure on 
      bacterial communities, in addition to its known direct positive effect.

TI  - Evaluation of Streptomyces sp. strain g10 for suppression of Fusarium wilt and 
      rhizosphere colonization in pot-grown banana plantlets.
PG  - 24-32
AB  - Streptomyces sp. strain g10 exhibited strong antagonism towards Fusarium 
      oxysporum f.sp. cubense (Foc) races 1, 2 and 4 in plate assays by producing 
      extracellular antifungal metabolites. Treating the planting hole and roots of 
      4-week-old tissue-culture-derived 'Novaria' banana plantlets with strain g10 
      suspension (10(8) cfu/ml), significantly (P < 0.05) reduced wilt severity when 
      the plantlets were inoculated with 10(4) spores/ml Foc race 4. The final disease 
      severity index for leaf symptom (LSI) and rhizome discoloration (RDI) was reduced 
      about 47 and 53%, respectively, in strain g10-treated plantlets compared to 
      untreated plantlets. Reduction in disease incidence was not significant (P < 
      0.05) when plantlets were inoculated with a higher concentration (10(6) 
      spores/ml) of Foc race 4. Rhizosphere population of strain g10 showed significant 
      (P = 0.05) increase of more than 2-fold at the end of the 3rd week compared to 
      the 2nd week after soil amendment with the antagonist. Although the level 
      dropped, the rhizosphere population at the end of the 6th week was still nearly 
      2-fold higher than the level detected after 2 weeks. In contrast, the root-free 
      population declined significantly (P = 0.05), nearly 4-fold after 6 weeks when 
      compared to the level detected after 2 weeks. Neither growth-inhibiting nor 
      growth-stimulating effects were observed in plantlets grown in strain g10-amended 
      soil.

TI  - Soil ciliate species richness and abundance associated with the rhizosphere of 
      different subtropical plant species.
PG  - 582-8
AB  - Soil protozoa, and ciliates in particular, represent a microbial group abundant 
      in the rhizosphere with an influential role on nutrient cycling. Under laboratory 
      conditions, ciliates regulate the size and the composition of bacterial 
      communities, and appear to stimulate ammonification and nitrification. In spite 
      of their important ecological role, our understanding about the factors that 
      control their diversity and abundance in natural forest ecosystems is still 
      rudimentary. Plant species-specific interactions have been demonstrated between 
      plants and soil bacteria and mycorrhizal fungi, due in part to the release of 
      phytohormones and C- and N-rich exudates. We tested the hypothesis that the 
      rhizosphere environments of different plant species also influence the species 
      richness and abundance of soil ciliates. Plant effect, soil pH, moisture content, 
      microbial biomass C, and inorganic nitrogen were measured among five plant 
      species to determine the best predictor variables for soil ciliate species 
      richness and total abundance in a subtropical moist forest in Puerto Rico. Based 
      on an analysis of variance, we rejected the hypothesis that there was a plant 
      species-specific effect on soil ciliates, unlike other microbial groups mentioned 
      above. Using multiple regression analysis, we demonstrated that the flush of 
      total inorganic nitrogen was the best predictor variable for both species 
      richness and abundance of ciliates.

TI  - In situ measurement of water absorption by fine roots of three temperate trees: 
      species differences and differential activity of superficial and deep roots.
PG  - 1359-67
AB  - The spatial heterogeneity of water uptake by fine roots under field conditions 
      was analyzed in situ with miniature sap flow gauges in a mature beech-oak-spruce 
      mixed stand. Sap flow rate (J), sap flow density (Jd), and root 
      surface-area-specific flow rate (uptake rate, Js) were measured for eight to 10 
      small-diameter roots (3-4 mm) per species in the organic layer (superficial 
      roots) and in the mineral soil (30-80 cm, deep roots) during four months in 
      summer 1999. We calculated Js by relating J to the surface area of the section of 
      the fine root system distal to the position of the gauge on the root. When 
      measured synchronously, roots of the three species did not differ significantly 
      in mean Js, although oak roots tended to have lower rates. However, Jd decreased 
      in the sequence spruce > beech > oak in most measurement periods. Microscopic 
      investigation revealed differences in fine root anatomy that may partly explain 
      the species differences in Jd and Js. Oak fine roots had a thicker periderm than 
      beech and spruce roots of similar diameter and spruce roots had fewer fine branch 
      rootlets than the other species. Synchronously recorded Jd and Js of nearby roots 
      of the same tree species showed large differences in flow with coefficients of 
      variation from 25 to 150% that could not be explained by patchy distribution of 
      soil water. We hypothesize that the main cause of the large spatial heterogeneity 
      in root water uptake is associated with differences between individual roots in 
      morphology and ultrastructure of the root cortex that affect root radial and 
      root-soil interface conductivities. The high intraspecific variation in Js may 
      mask species differences in root water uptake. Superficial roots of all species 
      typically had about five times higher Jd than deep roots of the same species. 
      However, Js values were similar for superficial and deep roots in beech and 
      spruce because small diameter roots of both species were more branched in the 
      organic layer than in mineral soil. In oak, deep roots had lower Js (maximum of 
      100 g m(-2) day(-1)) than superficial roots (about 1000 g m(-2) day(-1)). We 
      conclude that temperate tree species in mixed stands have different water uptake 
      capacities. Water flow in the rhizosphere of forests appears to be a highly 
      heterogeneous process that is influenced by both tree species and differences in 
      uptake rates of individual roots within a species.

TI  - Isolation and characterization of mesophilic, oxalate-degrading Streptomyces from 
      plant rhizosphere and forest soils.
PG  - 498-502
AB  - The present work was aimed at the isolation of additional new pure cultures of 
      oxalate-degrading Streptomyces and its preliminary characterization for further 
      work in the field of oxalate metabolism and taxonomic studies. Mesophilic, 
      oxalate-degrading Streptomyces were enriched and isolated from plant rhizosphere 
      and forest soil samples. Strains were examined for cultural, morphological (spore 
      chain morphology, spore mass colour, diffusible and melanin pigment production), 
      physiological (antibiosis, growth in the presence of inhibitory compounds, 
      assimilation of organic acids and enzyme substrates) and chemotaxonomic 
      characters (cellular lipid components and diagnostic cell-wall diamino acid). The 
      taxonomic data obtained were analysed by using the simple matching (SSM) and 
      Jaccard (Sj) coefficients, clustering was achieved using the UPGMA algorithm. All 
      strains were able to utilize sodium-, potassium-, calcium- and ammonium-oxalate 
      salts. Based on the results of numerical taxonomy, isolates were grouped into 
      five cluster groups with a > or =70% S(SM) similarity level. Streptomyces rochei 
      was the most common of the cluster groups, with a Willcox probability of P > 0.8. 
      Streptomyces antibioticus, S. anulatus, S. fulvissimus, S. halstedii and S. 
      violaceusniger are newly reported as oxalate-utilizing Streptomyces.

TI  - [Effect of fertilization on soil enzymes and microbes in Larix gemlinii 
      plantations].
PG  - 1000-4
AB  - One year-old second generation stand and 14 year- and 34 year-old first 
      generation stands in larch plantations were studied at the Maoershan Mt. 
      Experimental Forest Farm. The forestland of these three stands was treated with 
      various fertilizations. The results showed that fertilization could promote or 
      restrain soil enzyme activity and microbial amount with different degrees, and 
      its effect on soil physiological activity was more apparent. The effect of the 
      same fertilization treatments on soil enzyme activity and microbial amount was 
      different at different development stages of the stands. For one year-old stand, 
      the best fertilization scheme was treatment 9, its soil enzyme activities 
      (catalase, proteinase, polyphenoloxidase, urease, and saccharase), total 
      microbial amount, and amount of bacteria, actinomyces and fungus being increased 
      by 413.49%, 22.10%, 20.56%, 220.00%, 49.46%, 238.88%, 247.24%, 106.70%, and 
      366.67%, respectively, as compared with the control. For 34 year-old stand, the 
      best fertilization scheme was treatment 5, its soil enzyme activities (catalase, 
      proteinase, polyphenoloxidase, urease, and saccharase), total microbial amount, 
      and amount of bacteria and fungus was increased by 30.44%, 16.91%, 0.22%, 43.06%, 
      124.18%, 119.92%, 87.66%, and 17.57%, respectively in rhizosphere soil, and by 
      24.55%, 77.01%, 168.62%, 251.85%, 183.33%, 250.0%, 38.24% and 128.57%, 
      respectively in non-rhizosphere soil. For 14 year-old young stand, it needed a 
      proper amount of nitrogen fertilizer and organic mineral fertilizers, and the 
      better fertilization schemes were treatments 2 and 9. The soil enzyme activities 
      (catalase, proteinase, and urease) in treatment 2 was increased by 44.39%, 
      94.83%, and 4.62%, respectively in rhizosphere soil, and by 13.98%, 10.70% and 
      129.76%, respectively in non-rhizosphere soil. Total soil microbial amount and 
      the amount of bacteria and fungus in treatment 9 was increased by 176.49%, 
      266.63%, and 198.04%, respectively in rhizosphere soil, and by 275.56%, 66.67% 
      and 143.75%, respectively in non-rhizosphere soil.

AB  - The loss of carbon from roots (rhizodeposition) and the consequent proliferation 
      of microorganisms in the surrounding soil, coupled with the physical presence of 
      a root and processes associated with nutrient uptake, gives rise to a unique zone 
      of soil called the rhizosphere. In this review, we bring together evidence to 
      show that roots can directly regulate most aspects of rhizosphere C flow either 
      by regulating the exudation process itself or by directly regulating the 
      recapture of exudates from soil. Root exudates have been hypothesized to be 
      involved in the enhanced mobilization and acquisition of many nutrients from soil 
      or the external detoxification of metals. With few exceptions, there is little 
      mechanistic evidence from soil-based systems to support these propositions. We 
      conclude that much more integrated work in realistic systems is required to 
      quantify the functional significance of these processes in the field. We need to 
      further unravel the complexities of the rhizosphere in order to fully engage with 
      key scientific ideas such as the development of sustainable agricultural systems 
      and the response of ecosystems to climate change. Contents I. Introduction 460

TI  - Carbon fluxes to the soil in a mature temperate forest assessed by 13C isotope 
      tracing.
PG  - 489-501
AB  - Photosynthetic carbon uptake and respiratory C release from soil are major 
      components of the global carbon balance. The use of 13C depleted CO2)(delta13C = 
      -30 per thousand) in a free air CO2 enrichment experiment in a mature deciduous 
      forest permitted us to trace the carbon transfer from tree crowns to the 
      rhizosphere of 100-120 years old trees. During the first season of CO2 enrichment 
      the CO2 released from soil originated substantially from concurrent assimilation. 
      The small contribution of recent carbon in fine roots suggests a much slower fine 
      root turnover than is often assumed. 13C abundance in soil air correlated best 
      with temperature data taken from 4 to 10 days before air sampling time and is 
      thus rapidly available for root and rhizosphere respiration. The spatial 
      variability of delta13C in soil air showed relationships to above ground tree 
      types such as conifers versus broad-leaved trees. Considering the complexity and 
      strong overlap of roots from different individuals in a forest, this finding 
      opens an exciting new possibility of associating respiration with different 
      species. What might be seen as signal noise does in fact contain valuable 
      information on the spatial heterogeneity of tree-soil interaction.

TI  - Studies on the microbial populations of the rhizosphere of big sagebrush ( 
      Artemisia tridentata).
PG  - 278-88
AB  - Prolonged use of broad-spectrum antibiotics has led to the emergence of 
      drug-resistant pathogens, both in medicine and in agriculture. New threats such 
      as biological warfare have increased the need for novel and efficacious 
      antimicrobial agents. Natural habitats not previously examined as sources of 
      novel antibiotic-producing microorganisms still exist. One such habitat is the 
      rhizosphere of desert shrubs. Here, we show that one desert shrub habitat, the 
      rhizosphere of desert big sagebrush ( Artemisia tridentata) is a source of 
      actinomycetes capable of producing an extensive array of antifungal metabolites. 
      Culturable microbial populations from both the sagebrush rhizosphere and nearby 
      bulk soils from three different sites were enumerated and compared, using 
      traditional plate-count techniques and antibiotic activity bioassays. There were 
      no statistical differences between the relative numbers of culturable 
      non-actinomycete eubacteria, actinomycetes and fungi in the rhizosphere versus 
      bulk soils, but PCR amplification of the 16S rRNA gene sequences of the total 
      soil DNA and denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis showed that the community 
      structure was different between the rhizosphere and the bulk soils. A high 
      percentage of actinomycetes produced antimicrobials; and the percentage of active 
      producers was significantly higher among the rhizosphere isolates, as compared 
      with the bulk soil isolates. Also, the rhizosphere strains were more active in 
      the production of antifungal compounds than antibacterial compounds. 16S rRNA 
      gene sequence analysis showed that sagebrush rhizospheres contained a variety of 
      Streptomyces species possessing broad spectrum antifungal activity. Scanning 
      electron microscopy studies of sagebrush root colonization by one of the novel 
      sagebrush rhizosphere isolates, Streptomyces sp. strain RG, showed that it 
      aggressively colonized young sagebrush roots, whereas another plant 
      rhizosphere-colonizing strain, S. lydicus WYEC108, not originally isolated from 
      sagebrush, was a poor colonizer of the roots of this plant, as were two other 
      Streptomyces isolates from forest soil. These results support the hypothesis that 
      the rhizosphere of desert big sagebrush is a promising source of habitat-adapted 
      actinomycetes, producing antifungal antibiotics.

TI  - Converging patterns of uptake and hydraulic redistribution of soil water in 
      contrasting woody vegetation types.
PG  - 919-28
AB  - We used concurrent measurements of soil water content and soil water potential 
      (Psi(soil)) to assess the effects of Psi(soil) on uptake and hydraulic 
      redistribution (HR) of soil water by roots during seasonal drought cycles at six 
      sites characterized by differences in the types and amounts of woody vegetation 
      and in climate. The six sites included a semi-arid old-growth ponderosa pine 
      (Pinus ponderosa Dougl. ex P. Laws & C. Laws) forest, a moist old-growth 
      Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii (Mirb.) Franco) forest, a 24-year-old 
      Douglas-fir forest and three Brazilian savanna sites differing in tree density. 
      At all of the sites, HR was confined largely to the upper 60 cm of soil. There 
      was a common threshold relationship between the relative magnitude of HR and 
      Psi(soil) among the six study sites. Below a threshold Psi(soil) of about -0.4 
      MPa, overnight recharge of soil water storage increased sharply, and reached a 
      maximum value of 80-90% over a range of Psi(soil) from ~ -1.2 to -1.5 MPa. 
      Although amounts of water hydraulically redistributed to the upper 60 cm of soil 
      were relatively small (0 to 0.4 mm day(-1)), they greatly reduced the rates of 
      seasonal decline in Psi(soil). The effectiveness of HR in delaying soil drying 
      diminished with increasing sapwood area per ground area. The relationship between 
      soil water utilization and Psi(soil) in the 20-60-cm layer was nearly identical 
      for all six sites. Soil water utilization varied with a surrogate measure of 
      rhizosphere conductance in a similar manner at all six sites. The similarities in 
      relationships between Psi(soil) and HR, soil water utilization and relative 
      rhizosphere conductance among the six sites, suggests that, despite probable 
      differences in maximum rooting depth and density, there was a convergence in 
      biophysical controls on soil water utilization and redistribution in the upper 
      soil layers where the density of finer roots is greatest.

TI  - Belowground carbon cycling in a humid tropical forest decreases with 
      fertilization.
PG  - 545-50
AB  - Only a small fraction of the carbon (C) allocated belowground by trees is 
      retained by soils in long-lived, decay-resistant forms, yet because of the large 
      magnitude of terrestrial primary productivity, even small changes in C allocation 
      or retention can alter terrestrial C storage. The humid tropics exert a 
      disproportionately large influence over terrestrial C storage, but C allocation 
      and belowground retention in these ecosystems remain poorly quantified. Using 
      mass balance and 13C isotope methods, we examined the effects of afforestation 
      and fertilization, two land-use changes of large-scale importance, on belowground 
      C cycling at a humid tropical site in Hawaii. Here we report that in unfertilized 
      plots, 80% of the C allocated belowground by trees to roots and mycorrhizae was 
      returned to the atmosphere within 1 year; 9% of the belowground C flux was 
      retained in coarse roots and 11% was retained as new soil C. The gains in new 
      soil C were offset entirely by losses of old soil C. Further, while fertilization 
      early in stand development increased C storage in the litter layer and in coarse 
      roots, it reduced by 22% the flux of C moving through roots and mycorrhizae into 
      mineral soils. Because soil C formation rates related strongly to rhizosphere C 
      flux, fertilization may reduce an already limited capacity of these forests to 
      sequester decay-resistant soil C.

TI  - Feedback interactions between needle litter decomposition and rhizosphere 
      activity.
PG  - 551-9
AB  - The aim of our study was to identify interactions between the decomposition of 
      aboveground litter and rhizosphere activity. The experimental approach combined 
      the placement of labelled litter (delta13C=-37.9 per thousand ) with forest 
      girdling in a 35-year-old Norway spruce stand, resulting in four different 
      treatment combinations: GL (girdled, litter), GNL (girdled, no litter), NGL (not 
      girdled, litter), and NGNL (not girdled, no litter). Monthly sampling of soil CO2 
      efflux and delta13C of soil respired CO2 between May and October 2002 allowed the 
      partitioning of the flux into that derived from the labelled litter, and that 
      derived from native soil organic matter and roots. The effect of forest girdling 
      on soil CO2 efflux was detectable from June (girdling took place in April), and 
      resulted in GNL fluxes to be about 50% of NGNL fluxes by late August. The 
      presence of litter resulted in significantly increased fluxes for the first 2 
      months of the experiment, with significantly greater litter derived fluxes from 
      non-girdled plots and a significant interaction between girdling and litter 
      treatments over the same period. For NGL collars, the additional efflux was found 
      to originate only in part from litter decomposition, but also from the decay of 
      native soil organic matter. In GL collars, this priming effect was not 
      significant, indicating an active role of the rhizosphere in soil priming. The 
      results therefore indicate mutual positive feedbacks between litter decomposition 
      and rhizosphere activity. Soil biological analysis (microbial and fungal biomass) 
      of the organic layers indicated greatest activity below NGL collars, and we 
      suppose that this increase indicates the mechanism of mutual positive feedback 
      between rhizosphere activity and litter decomposition. However, elimination of 
      fresh C input from both above- and belowground (GNL) also resulted in greater 
      fungal abundance than for the NGNL treatment, indicating likely changes in fungal 
      community structure (i.e. a shift from symbiotic to saprotrophic species 
      abundance).

TI  - [Relationship between soil organic phosphorus forms in larch plantations and tree 
      growth].
PG  - 2157-61
AB  - Using the organic phosphorus fractionation system suggested by Bowman and Cole, 
      this paper studied the dynamics of labile, moderately labile, moderately 
      resistant, and highly resistant organic phosphorus in rhizosphere and 
      non-rhizosphere soil at different development stages of larch, and their 
      relationships with soil available phosphorus and tree growth yield. The results 
      showed that the main components of soil organic phosphorus in larch plantation 
      were moderately labile and moderately resistant organic phosphorus, amounted to 
      77.07%-86.68% of the total organic phosphorus. The labile and moderately labile 
      organic phosphorus in rhizosphere soil were the main sources of soil available 
      phosphorus at different development stages of larch. The contents of total 
      organic phosphorus, labile organic phosphorus, moderately resistant organic 
      phosphorus and highly resistant organic phosphorus in rhizosphere soil decreased 
      with stand ages from young stand to near mature stand, but increased from near 
      mature stand to mature stand. No apparent change of the moderately labile organic 
      phosphorus content was found over stand ages in rhizosphere soil. The contents of 
      various organic phosphorus forms presented a fluctuating increasing tendency in 
      non-rhizosphere soil as stand ages increased. There was a close relationship 
      between the increments of periodic average diameter at breast height and periodic 
      average height and the contents of soil labile organic phosphorus and available 
      phosphorus.

TI  - [Dynamics of dissolved organic matter in terrestrial ecosystem and its 
      environmental impact].
PG  - 2019-25
AB  - Dissolved organic matter (DOM), the most active organic carbon pool in 
      terrestrial ecosystem, has a greater effect on the mobilization, translocation, 
      and ecological toxicity of many inorganic and organic pollutants in environment. 
      The DOM concentration in farmlands varies from 10 to 80 mgC.L-1, while most of 
      wetlands contain 25-50 mgC.L-1 of DOM, which is similar to the leachate from 
      forest soils. However, soil DOM can be increased to above 200-1000 mgC.L-1 in the 
      rhizosphere or in the plots amended with organic manures. Generally, soil DOM 
      containing a great deal of lower molecular weight fractions or hydrophilic 
      fractions is more mobile and readily biodegradable, compared to the DOM with 
      larger molecular weight or hydrophobic fractions. However, soils with lower pH 
      and higher amount of oxides can adsorb DOM more strongly, and as a result, the 
      mobile DOM in the soils will be reduced. Liming, water-logging, dry-wet recycling 
      and higher temperature can increase the concentration of soil DOM. Furthermore, 
      DOM can enhance the dissolution and translocation of inorganic and organic 
      pollutants, due to the formation of DOM-pollutant complex, resulting in 
      environmental risks. It was suggested that the dynamics of DOM in terrestrial 
      ecosystem and the transportation flux and model of DOM or its associated 
      pollutants from terrestrial to aquatic ecosystem should be considered in future 
      research.

TI  - [Effects of rhizosphere acidification on phosphorus efficiency in clones of 
      poplar].
PG  - 1607-11
AB  - Effects of rhizosphere acidification on P efficiency in different poplar clones 
      were conducted by the method of soil culture in greenhouse. Potassium dihydrogen 
      phosphate was applied to furnish 0, 40, 80, and 120 mg P2O5 kg-1. The experiment 
      consisted of three replicates of each treatment, with a pot of 40 kg soil in a 
      randomized block. The results showed that high P efficiency clones, such as S17, 
      S19, and 105, could decrease their pH values in rhizosphere under P deficiency 
      stress much stronger than clones 106, 797, I-69, 1388, and 3,244, which were low 
      P efficiency clones. The most decrement of pH for the former even accounted to 
      1.32 pH units and the ratios of the decrements were over 10% in comparison with 
      the pH values in bulk soil. Whereas for the latter less than 0.21 pH units and 
      2.5% of the decreasing ratio respectively. In contrast to low P efficiency 
      clones, high P efficiency clones could acidify their rhizosphere through a kind 
      of specific mechanism because the pH values in rhizosphere of high P efficiency 
      clones were gradually decreased corresponding with the intensity of P deficiency 
      stress and vice versa. The amounts of available P in rhizosphere of clone S17, 
      S19, and 105 reached 2.64, 3.27, and 3.28 mg.kg-1, respectively, obviously higher 
      than those of the other five low P efficiency clones, which all were below 2.00 
      mg.kg-1 under P deficiency stress, and the summation percentages of available P 
      in rhizosphere were over 60% for all high P efficiency clones, but less than 10% 
      for low P efficiency clones. The amounts of P taken up by high P efficiency 
      clones were statistically greater than by low P efficiency clones. Regression 
      analysis also indicated that the increment of available P in rhizosphere was 
      closely correlated with the decrement of pH values in rhizosphere under P 
      deficiency stress. This demonstrated the impact of rhizosphere acidification on 
      availability of rhizosphere P, and identified that high P efficiency clones could 
      enhance their contents of available P in rhizosphere, absorb more P and thus grow 
      better through rhizosphere acidification depended on deficiency stress.

TI  - Mobility of radiocesium in three distinct forest floors.
PG  - 241-52
AB  - The degree of mixing of organic matter with minerals in organic and hemi-organic 
      horizons of forest soils largely differs between humus types. As clay minerals 
      might control the mobility of radiocesium in these forest floor horizons, plant 
      contamination could greatly vary with the kind of humus. We measured the mobility 
      of radiocesium in the upper O, OAh and Ah horizons of three acid forest soils 
      with three distinct humus types: eumoder, dysmoder and fibrimor. We used two 
      different approaches: a physico-chemical test quantifying the radiocesium 
      interception potential (RIP) and a biological assay simulating an experimental 
      rhizosphere. The results show that the (137)Cs horizon-to-plant transfer is 
      directly governed by RIP, and thus by frayed edge sites born by weathered 
      micaceous minerals. The inverse relationship between RIP and organic matter 
      content indicates that in the three sites investigated the mixing of organic 
      residues with Cs-fixing minerals is a key process in 137Cs mobility. These 
      Cs-fixing clay minerals indeed decrease in the sequence eumoder > dysmoder > 
      fibrimor because they are more diluted in forest floor with less bioturbation. 
      Our results suggest that humus type might be an important parameter in 
      classifying forest soils with respect to their ability to transfer radiocesium to 
      the above standing vegetation.

AB  - Time of flight secondary ion mass spectroscopy has been used to study the metal 
      distribution at the soil/root interface of tree roots extracted from 
      smelter-impacted soils. The results, augmented by scanning electron microscopy, 
      show that the technique is capable of resolving metal distributions at the 
      cellular level. In addition, the distribution of metals between the root plaque 
      and the root interior may be useful in interpreting local metal transport 
      mechanisms.

TI  - Phytophthora pseudosyringae sp. nov., a new species causing root and collar rot 
      of deciduous tree species in Europe.
PG  - 772-89
AB  - In several studies of oak decline in Europe, a semi-papillate homothallic 
      Phytophthora taxon was consistently isolated, together with other Phytophthora 
      species, from rhizosphere soil samples. It was also found associated with 
      necrotic fine roots and stem necroses of Fagus sylvatica and Alnus glutinosa. Due 
      to morphological and physiological similarities, the semi-papillate isolates were 
      previously identified as P. syringae by various authors. The morphology, 
      physiology and pathogenicity against fine roots of Quercus robur, Q. petraea and 
      F. sylvatica, bark of A. glutinosa, leaves of Ilex aquifolium and apple fruits of 
      this Phytophthora species are described and compared with those of related and 
      similar Phytophthora species, namely P. ilicis, P. psychrophila, P. quercina, P. 
      citricola and P. syringae. The phylogenetic placement on the basis of ITS and 
      mtDNA sequence data was also examined. Isolates of this taxon produce colonies 
      with stellate to rosaceous growth patterns and limited aerial mycelium on various 
      agar media. Antheridia are predominantly paragynous. In water culture catenulate 
      hyphal swellings and semi-papillate caducous sporangia, that are usually 
      limoniform, ellipsoid or ovoid, are formed abundandly, mostly in lax or dense 
      sympodia. This taxon is a moderately slow growing, low temperature species with 
      optimum and maximum temperatures around 20 and 25 degrees C, respectively. Tested 
      isolates are moderately aggressive to fine roots of oaks and beech, highly 
      aggressive to holly leaves and apple fruits, and slightly pathogenic to alder 
      bark. Thirteen tested isolates had an identical and distinct ITS sequence which 
      was more similar to that of P. ilicis and P. psychrophila than any other known 
      taxa. On the basis of their unique combination of morphological characters, 
      colony growth patterns, cardinal temperatures for growth, growth rates, 
      pathogenicity to oaks, beech, alder, apple and holly, their host range, and ITS 
      and mtDNA sequences the semi-papillate caducous Phytophthora isolates from oaks, 
      beech and alder are clearly separated from related and similar Phytophthora spp., 
      and described as a new species, P. pseudosyringae sp. nov.

TI  - Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi associated with Araucaria angustifolia (Bert.) O. 
      Ktze.
PG  - 211-5
AB  - Specimens of Araucaria angustifolia from a native forest reserve and a reforested 
      area in the State Park of Campos do Jordao were studied to determine the number 
      and diversity of spore populations of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) and root 
      colonization. Six randomly chosen plots (planted with 8- to 12-year-old plants) 
      were delimited, four in the native forest and two in the reforested area. 
      Rhizosphere and root samples were collected during two periods of the year 
      corresponding to the rainy and dry seasons. A greenhouse experiment was set up 
      for multiplication of field propagules (from the native forest and reforested 
      area) for two consecutive generations. Araucaria leaves from the experimental 
      plots were collected during the first sampling for nutrient analysis. Twenty-four 
      AMF taxa were found and percent AM colonization was determined in all plots. Not 
      all AMF species observed in the field were re-isolated through the recovery pot 
      cultures, even after a second cultivation cycle. The foliar nutrient analysis 
      showed higher nutrient levels in plants from the native forest than the 
      reforested area. Generally, spore richness and diversity were highest during the 
      warmer and more humid period and in the native forest plants.

TI  - Diversity and abundance of Crenarchaeota in terrestrial habitats studied by 16S 
      RNA surveys and real time PCR.
PG  - 787-97
AB  - Novel phylogenetic lineages of as yet uncultivated crenarchaeota have been 
      frequently detected in low to moderate-temperature, marine and terrestrial 
      environments. In order to gain a more comprehensive view on the distribution and 
      diversity of Crenarchaeota in moderate habitats, we have studied 18 different 
      terrestrial and freshwater samples by 16S rDNA-based phylogenetic surveys. In 
      seven different soil samples of diverse geographic areas in Europe (forest, 
      grassland, ruderal) and Asia (permafrost, ruderal) as well as in two microbial 
      mats, we have consistently found one particular lineage of crenarchaeota. The 
      diversity of Crenarchaeota in freshwater sediments was considerably higher with 
      respresentative 16S rDNA sequences distributed over four different groups within 
      the moderate crenarchaeota. Systematic analysis of a 16S rDNA universal library 
      from a sandy ecosystem containing 800 clones exclusively revealed the presence of 
      the soil-specific crenarchaeotal cluster. With primers specific for 
      non-thermophilic crenarchaeota we established a rapid method to quantify archaeal 
      16S rDNA in real time PCR. The relative abundance of crenarchaeotal rDNA was 
      0.5-3% in the bulk soil sample and only 0.16% in the rhizosphere of the sandy 
      ecosystem. A nearby agricultural setting yielded a relative abundance of 0.17% 
      crenarchaeotal rDNA. In total our data suggest that soil crenarchaeota represent 
      a stable and specific component of the microbiota in terrestrial habitats.

TI  - A study on microbial diversity in different cultivars of Brassica napus in 
      relation to its wilt pathogen, Verticillium longisporum.
PG  - 269-76
AB  - Oilseed rape (Brassica napus) is one of the major oilseed crops in the world but 
      is vulnerable to attack by many pathogens and insect pests. In addition to the 
      host plant genotype, micro-organisms present in the rhizosphere and within plant 
      tissues affect the susceptibility to plant pathogens. While rapid progress has 
      been achieved concerning the concept of plant resistance genes, information on 
      the role of the microbial community in plant protection is less apparent. We have 
      studied the endophytic bacterial populations present in different tissues of 
      oilseed rape and also analysed several cultivars (Express, Libraska, Maluka and 
      Westar), which differ in their susceptibility to the wilt pathogen Verticillium 
      longisporum. The population diversity was studied using agar plating assay, fatty 
      acid methyl ester analysis and functional characterisation of isolated strains. 
      Our work shows that already in the seeds there exists diversity in populations as 
      well as in the total microbial load between two of the four tested cultivars. 
      About 50% of the strains isolated from cultivars Express and Libraska showed 
      moderate to strong direct inhibition of V. longisporum. The diversity of the 
      endophytic flora isolated from oilseed rape and its implications in crop 
      protection are discussed.

TI  - Microbial population of spruce soil in Tatachia mountain of Taiwan.
PG  - 1489-98
AB  - To investigate the role of microorganisms in the ecology and the nutrient 
      transformation of forest soil, soil property, microbial population, biomass and 
      organic acid content of Spruce soil in Tatachia mountain were determined during 
      January 1997 to November 1999. Soil temperatures were between 5.5 and 15.6 
      degrees C and soil pH ranged from 3.6 to 5.0. Total organic carbon and nitrogen 
      contents ranged from 5.83% to 34.35% and from 0.90% to 3.19%, respectively. C/N 
      ratio was between 7.07 and 18.24. Each gram of dry soil contained microbial 
      biomass carbon 308-870 microg, microbial biomass nitrogen 107-240 microg, malic 
      acid 74-211 nM and succinic acid 32-175 nM. In addition, each gram of dry organic 
      layer contained microbial biomass carbon 216-653 microg, microbial biomass 
      nitrogen 10.3-33.8 microg, formic acid 256-421 nM, acetic acid 301-435 nM, malic 
      acid 795-1027 nM and succinic acid 204-670 nM. About 45.5-90.9% of topsoil 
      samples had higher microbial population than those of subsoil especially in 
      actinomycetes, cellulolytic and phosphate-solubilizing microorganisms. Although 
      rhizosphere of Spruce had higher total organic carbon and total nitrogen content 
      than non-rhizosphere and dwarf bamboo areas, the microbial population had no 
      significant difference among them.

TI  - Rhizosphere feedbacks in elevated CO(2).
PG  - 313-320
AB  - Understanding rhizosphere processes in relation to increasing atmospheric CO(2) 
      concentrations is important for predicting the response of forest ecosystems to 
      environmental changes, because rhizosphere processes are intimately linked with 
      nutrient cycling and soil organic matter decomposition, both of which feedback to 
      tree growth and soil carbon storage. Plants grown in elevated CO(2) substantially 
      increase C input to the rhizosphere. Although it is known that elevated CO(2) 
      enhances rhizosphere respiration more than it enhances root biomass, the fate and 
      function of this extra carbon input to the rhizosphere in response to elevated 
      CO(2) are not clear. Depending on specific plant and soil conditions, the 
      increased carbon input to the rhizosphere can result in an increase, a decrease, 
      or no effect on soil organic matter decomposition and nutrient mineralization. 
      Three mechanisms may account for these inconsistent results: (1) the 
      "preferential substrate utilization" hypothesis; (2) the "priming effect" 
      hypothesis; and (3) the "competition" hypothesis, i.e., competition for mineral 
      nutrients between plants and soil microorganisms. A microbial growth model is 
      developed that quantitatively links the increased rhizosphere input in response 
      to elevated CO(2) with soil organic matter decomposition. The model incorporates 
      the three proposed mechanisms, and simulates the complexity of the rhizosphere 
      processes. The model also illustrates mechanistically the interactions among 
      nitrogen availability, substrate quality, and microbial dynamics when the system 
      is exposed to elevated CO(2).

TI  - Fine root respiration in mature eastern white pine (Pinus strobus) in situ: the 
      importance of CO(2) in controlled environments.
PG  - 475-479
AB  - We measured seasonal fine root respiration rate in situ while controlling chamber 
      temperature and [CO(2)]. Atmospheric [CO(2)] ([CO(2)](a)) and measured soil 
      [CO(2)] ([CO(2)](s)) were alternately delivered to a cuvette containing intact 
      fine roots of eastern white pine (Pinus strobus L.). Respiration rates were 
      consistently higher in [CO(2)](a) than in [CO(2)](s) and were almost three times 
      higher during midsummer. Respiration rates were immediately reversed after 
      returning to the alternate [CO(2)] (i.e., [CO(2)](a) --> [CO(2)](s) --> 
      [CO(2)](a), and vice versa) suggesting a direct effect of elevated [CO(2)] on 
      apparent respiration. Soil-[CO(2)]-based respiration rates decreased with 
      increasing [CO(2)] on a dry mass and tissue [N] basis. We conclude that estimates 
      of soil CO(2) flux and soil carbon budgets may be improved by more completely 
      accounting for the rhizosphere microclimate (i.e., soil temperature and 
      [CO(2)](s)) during measurement of fine root respiration.

AB  - Rhizosphere bacteria from Lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta) seedlings were 
      characterized from forest soils which differed in disturbance and geographic 
      source. Soil disturbance treatments included whole-tree harvesting with and 
      without heavy soil compaction and whole-tree harvesting with complete surface 
      organic matter removal and heavy soil compaction from British Columbia (BC) 
      Ministry of Forests Long-Term Soil Productivity installations in three 
      biogeoclimatic subzones in central BC, Canada. Bacterial community members were 
      characterized by DNA sequence analysis of 16S rRNA gene fragments following 
      direct DNA isolation from soil, polymerase chain reaction amplification and 
      cloning. Phylogenetic analyses revealed that 85% of 709 16S rDNA clones were 
      classified as alpha-, beta-, gamma-, and delta-Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria, 
      Cytophaga-Flexibacter-Bacteroides group, Acidobacterium, Verrucomicrobia, and 
      candidate divisions OP10 and TM6. Members of the Proteobacteria and 
      Acidobacterium represented 55% and 19% of the clone library, respectively, 
      whereas the remaining bacterial divisions each comprised less than 4% of the 
      clone library. One hundred and six 16S rDNA clones could not be classified into 
      known bacterial divisions. No significant differences were detected for soil 
      disturbance treatment or site effects on the proportions of 16S rDNA clones 
      affiliated with Proteobacteria and Acidobacterium. Phylogenetic analyses revealed 
      that it was common for 16S rRNA gene fragments from different soil disturbance 
      treatments and geographic locations to be closely related.

TI  - Maintenance and impacts of an inoculated mer/luc-tagged Pseudomonas fluorescens 
      on microbial communities in birch rhizospheres developed on humus and peat.
PG  - 39-52
AB  - Antagonistic bacteria represent promising biocontrol agents for improving forest 
      production in seedling nurseries or forest soils. The fate of an introduced 
      mer/luc-tagged antagonistic Pseudomonas fluorescens 31K3 was monitored in the 
      rhizosphere of silver birch (Betula pendula) seedlings grown in microcosms 
      containing forest humus or nursery peat. The inoculated strain (10(8) cfu g(-1) 
      soil) was unable to establish in significant numbers in either soil type and 
      turned nonculturable in humus. Detection in both soils was possible only via 
      luminescence of enrichment cultures 80 days post-inoculation. Despite low P. 
      fluorescens survival, inoculation had a positive effect on seedling growth. 
      Limited impact of inoculation on the indigenous microbial communities was 
      identified following analyses of respiration and denitrification potential, 
      community-level physiological profiles and molecular fingerprinting of fungi and 
      eubacteria, and Pseudomonas community structures. The minor changes observed in 
      the indigenous microbial communities, including mycorrhiza development, were not 
      consistent between humus and peat growth substrates. It was concluded that the 
      rhizosphere-related microbial communities developed in both of these highly 
      organic soil systems are highly buffered against introduction of foreign 
      bacteria.

TI  - First Report of Littleleaf Disease Caused by Phytophthora cinnamomi on Pinus 
      occidentalis in the Dominican Republic.
PG  - 1275
LID - 10.1094/PDIS.2002.86.11.1275C [doi]
AB  - Pinus occidentalis Sw. is an endemic species of the Caribbean island of 
      Hispaniola (Dominican Republic and Haiti). It shows an extreme ecological 
      plasticity and grows on a wide range of soil types from 0 to 3,175 m in elevation 
      with annual mean temperatures ranging from 6 to 25 degrees C and annual precipitation of 
      800 to 2,300 mm. P. occidentalis is a major component of forests above 800 m in 
      elevation and forms pure climax forests above 2,000 m (4). For more than 10 
      years, stands of P. occidentalis in the Sierra (Cordillera Central) growing on a 
      wide range of site conditions have suffered from a serious widespread disease. 
      Symptoms include yellowing and dwarfing of needles, a progressive defoliation and 
      dieback of the crown, and finally, death of weakened trees often caused by 
      attacks by secondary bark beetles. Mature stands are mainly affected, but the 
      disease is also present in plantations and natural regeneration that is older 
      than 10 years. Disease spread is rapid, and occurs mainly along roads and from 
      diseased trees downslope following the path of water runoff. Initially, 
      Leptographium serpens was isolated from necrotic roots and was thought to be the 
      causal agent (1). However, the symptoms of the disease more closely resemble 
      those of littleleaf disease of P. echinata and P. taeda in the southeastern 
      United States, which is caused by the aggressive fine-root pathogen Phytophthora 
      cinnamomi Rands (3). Moreover, spread and dynamics of the disease are similar to 
      the diebacks of Chamaecyparis lawsoniana in Oregon and Eucalyptus spp. in western 
      Australia, which are caused by the introduced soilborne pathogens Phytophthora 
      lateralis and Phytophthora cinnamomi, respectively. Soil samples containing the 
      rhizosphere and fine roots of diseased P. occidentalis trees were collected in 
      February 2002 at five sites near Celestina and Los Montones (Dominican Republic) 
      and transported to the Bavarian State Institute of Forestry. The pathogen was 
      baited from the soil by floating 3- to 7-dayold leaves of Quercus robur seedlings 
      over flooded soil and placing the leaves on selective PARPNH agar (2). 
      Phytophthora cinnamomi was isolated from the soil of all five sites. Crossing 
      with A1 and A2 tester strains of Phytophthora cinnamomi confirmed that all 
      isolates belong to the A2 mating type. In cross sections of necrotic fine roots, 
      characteristic structures of Phytophthora cinnamomi such as nonseptate hyphae and 
      chlamydospores could be observed. Our results indicate that the disease of P. 
      occidentalis is caused by the introduced pathogen Phytophthora cinnamomi. Because 
      of the ecological and economical importance of P. occidentalis, the disease poses 
      a major threat to forestry in the Dominican Republic. Future research should 
      include the mapping of the disease, pathogenicity tests on P. occidentalis and 
      alternative pine species, in particular P. caribaea, screening for resistance in 
      the field, and testing of systemic fungicides such as potassium phosphonate, 
      which is known to be effective against Phytophthora cinnamomi. References: (1) G.

TI  - Are Sebacinaceae common and widespread ectomycorrhizal associates of Eucalyptus 
      species in Australian forests?
PG  - 243-7
AB  - A molecular survey of basidiomycete ectomycorrhizal fungi colonising root tips at 
      a site in Eucalyptus marginata (jarrah) forest revealed the presence of many 
      fungal species which could not be identified from a database of ITS-PCR-RFLP 
      profiles from morphologically identified species. Three of these unidentified 
      taxa were among the six most frequently encountered profiles. Phylogenetic 
      analyses of ITS and nuclear LSU sequences revealed a close relationship among the 
      three fungi and that they belong to the family Sebacinaceae (sensu Weiss and 
      Oberwinkler 2001). The possibility that DNA of non-ectomycorrhizal rhizosphere or 
      endophytic fungi had been amplified selectively by the basidiomycete-specific 
      primers was tested by amplification with fungal-specific primers. A single PCR 
      fragment was amplified in all but two of the 24 samples tested and digestion with 
      two restriction enzymes produced RFLP profiles which matched those from the 
      Sebacinoid sequence. We conclude, therefore, that at least three species of 
      Sebacinaceae are common ectomycorrhizal associates of E. marginata.

TI  - Influence of elevated CO(2) on the fungal community in a coastal scrub oak forest 
      soil investigated with terminal-restriction fragment length polymorphism 
      analysis.
PG  - 4370-6
AB  - Sixteen open-top chambers (diameter, 3.66 m) were established in a scrub oak 
      habitat in central Florida where vegetation was removed in a planned burn prior 
      to chamber installation. Eight control chambers have been continuously exposed to 
      ambient air and eight have been continuously exposed to elevated CO(2) at 
      twice-ambient concentration (approximately 700 ppm) for 5 years. Soil cores were 
      collected from each chamber to examine the influence of elevated atmospheric 
      CO(2) on the fungal community in different soil fractions. Each soil sample was 
      physically fractionated into bulk soil, rhizosphere soil, and roots for separate 
      analyses. Changes in relative fungal biomass were estimated by the ergosterol 
      technique. In the bulk soil and root fractions, a significantly increased level 
      of ergosterol was detected in the elevated CO(2) treatments relative to ambient 
      controls. Fungal community composition was determined by terminal-restriction 
      fragment length polymorphism (T-RFLP) analysis of the internal transcribed spacer 
      (ITS) region. The specificities of different ITS primer sets were evaluated 
      against plant and fungal species isolated from the experimental site. Changes in 
      community composition were assessed by principal component analyses of T-RFLP 
      profiles resolved by capillary electrophoresis. Fungal species richness, defined 
      by the total number of terminal restriction fragments, was not significantly 
      affected by either CO(2) treatment or soil fraction.

TI  - First Confirmation of Phytophthora quercina on Oaks in Asia.
PG  - 442
LID - 10.1094/PDIS.2002.86.4.442C [doi]
AB  - During surveys of forests in the Asian Region of Turkey in 1999, 2000, and 2001, 
      mature trees of several oak species were observed to have symptoms of decline, 
      including thinning of the crown, yellowing and wilting of leaves, dieback of 
      branches, and growth of epicormic shoots on branches and the main trunk. 
      Observations over time confirmed a slow progress of tree mortality. To isolate 
      Phytophthora spp. that might be associated with the decline, samples of 
      rhizosphere soil including fine roots with necrotic lesions, were collected from 
      around the bases of individual trees. Young leaflets from Quercus robur, Q. 
      petraea, and Q. hartwissiana were used in a bioassay to bait flooded soil 
      subsamples. After 3 to 5 days, baits were transferred to plates of PARPNH, a 
      medium selective for Phytophthora spp. (1). Phytophthora spp. were recovered from 
      38 of 51 sites investigated (75%). In all, 10 species of Phytophthora were 
      isolated; P. quercina was detected most frequently and was obtained from 29 (57%) 
      sampled sites. Identification of isolates of P. quercina was based on comparisons 
      of cultural and morphological characteristics to the description of the holotype 
      (2) and to authentic cultures. Slight differences from the description of the 
      holotype were observed for the size of sporangia, oogonia, and chlamydospores. On 
      V8 agar most of the colonies showed an optimal radial growth at 22.5 degrees C, with a 
      growth rate ranging from 4.5 to 5.6 mm per day. Isolates from Turkey showed a 
      lower optimal temperature and a higher growth rate compared with European 
      strains. Recent studies have shown that many Phytophthora species, including P. 
      quercina, occur in declining oak stands in Europe. In pathogenicity tests of 
      infested soil, P. quercina isolates proved to be one of the more pathogenic 
      species to roots of young Q. robur plants (2). Previously, P. quercina was only 
      found in Europe. New hosts species for P. quercina include Q. hartwissiana, Q. 
      frainetto, and the endemic species Q. vulcanica. Observations suggest that P. 
      quercina is widespread in Turkey and occurs within the natural range of oak, 
      which raises the question of the role of P. quercina in the oak decline syndrome.

TI  - Fate of POPs (DDX, HCHs, PCBs) in upper soil layers of pine forests.
PG  - 143-54
AB  - Organochlorines (HCH isomers, DDX and individual PCBs) were determined in pine 
      needle litter and upper soil layers of three forest test areas in central 
      Germany. The contents accumulating over a number of years or even decades in the 
      organic surface layer are compared with the levels of new inputs from needle fall 
      as well as with the levels of older inputs in the upper mineral soil layer. 
      Differences in behaviour between the soil horizons are discussed, especially 
      concerning the DDX and HCH groups. With approximately comparable Corg values 
      (approx. 21-24%) the pH value in the range of 4.24-2.90 in the O-horizon of the 
      forest soils exerts a large influence. Hence the A-horizon represents--for 
      p,p'-DDT and gamma-HCH in particular--at pH values of 2.90 a pollutant reservoir 
      which should not be underestimated and which could endanger the rhizosphere and 
      the groundwater. According to PCBs, in the more acidic soils with a pH value <4.0 
      the lipophilic higher polychlorinated biphenyls were found to be more highly 
      enriched in the humus layer.

TI  - Soil organic horizons as a major source for radiocesium biorecycling in forest 
      ecosystems.
PG  - 175-90
AB  - Here we review some of the main processes and key parameters affecting the 
      mobility of radiocesium in soils of semi-natural areas. We further illustrate 
      them in a collection of soil surface horizons which largely differ in their 
      organic matter contents. In soils, specific retention of radiocesium occurs in a 
      very small number of sorbing sites, which are the frayed edge sites (FES) born 
      out of weathered micaceous minerals. The FES abundance directly governs the 
      mobility of trace Cs in the rhizosphere and thus its transfer from soil to plant. 
      Here, we show that the accumulation of organic matter in topsoils can exert a 
      dilution of FES-bearing minerals in the thick humus of some forest soils. 
      Consequently, such accumulation significantly contributes to increasing 137Cs 
      soil-to-plant transfer. Potassium depletion and extensive exploration of the 
      organic horizons by plant roots can further enhance the contamination hazard. As 
      humus thickness depends on both ecological conditions and forest management. our 
      observations support the following ideas: (1) forest ecosystems can be classified 
      according to their sensitivity to radiocesium bio-recycling, (2) specific forest 
      management could be searched to decrease such bio-recycling.

TI  - Alterations in plant growth and in root hormone levels of lodgepole pines 
      inoculated with rhizobacteria.
PG  - 793-800
AB  - The presence of other soil microorganisms might influence the ability of 
      rhizobacterial inoculants to promote plant growth either by reducing contact 
      between the inoculant and the plant root or by interfering with the mechanism(s) 
      involved in rhizobacterially mediated growth promotion. We conducted the 
      following experiments to determine whether reductions in the extent of growth 
      promotion of lodgepole pine mediated by Paenibacillus polymyxa occur in the 
      presence of a forest soil isolate (Pseudomonas fluorescens M20) and whether 
      changes in plant growth promotion mediated by P. polymyxa (i) are related to 
      changes in P. polymyxa density in the rhizosphere or (ii) result from alterations 
      in root hormone levels. The extent of plant growth, P. polymyxa rhizosphere 
      density, and root hormone concentrations were determined for lodgepole pine 
      treated with (i) a single growth-promoting rhizobacterial strain (P. polymyxa L6 
      or Pw-2) or (ii) a combination of bacteria: strain L6 + strain M20 or strain Pw-2 
      + strain M20. There was no difference in the growth of pines inoculated with 
      strain L6 and those inoculated with strain L6 + strain M20. However, seedlings 
      inoculated with strain Pw-2 had more lateral roots and greater root mass at 12 
      weeks after inoculation than plants inoculated with strain Pw-2 + strain M20. The 
      extent of growth promotion mediated by P. polymyxa L6 and Pw-2 in each treatment 
      was not correlated to the average population density of each strain in the 
      rhizosphere. Bacterial species-specific effects were observed in root hormone 
      levels: indole-3-acetic acid concentration was elevated in roots inoculated with 
      P. polymyxa L6 or Pw-2, while dihydrozeatin riboside concentration was elevated 
      in roots inoculated with P. fluorescens M20.

PG  - 65-73
AB  - Studies were carried out on the utilization of different sugars (glucose, 
      fructose, arabinose, xylose, sucrose) and organic acids (acetic, citric, fumaric, 
      propionic, succinic) by fast and slow growing bacteria isolated from the roots of 
      pine seedlings (P. silvestris L.) inoculated with root-free, rhizosphere and 
      mycorrhizosphere soil from nursery and mature pine forest. Sucrose among sugars 
      and propionic acid among organic acids were the less frequently utilized 
      compounds. Sugars were better carbon sources than organic acids. Proportion of 
      isolates utilizing respective sugars or organic acids was, in general, 
      significantly higher among fast growing bacteria as compared with slow growing 
      ones. No significant differences in number of strains assimilating the appropiate 
      sugars depending on their original habitat or kind of soil were observed. Such 
      differences were noted for utilization of some organic acids. 3-factor ANOVA 
      confirmed that the growth speed of bacteria at the moment of their isolation had 
      the strongest effect on utilization of the compounds studied.

TI  - Tree stem diameter variations and transpiration in Scots pine: an analysis using 
      a dynamic sap flow model.
PG  - 889-97
AB  - A dynamic model for simulating water flow in a Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) 
      tree was developed. The model is based on the cohesion theory and the assumption 
      that fluctuating water tension driven by transpiration, together with the 
      elasticity of wood tissue, causes variations in the diameter of a tree stem and 
      branches. The change in xylem diameter can be linked to water tension in 
      accordance with Hookea s law. The model was tested against field measurements of 
      the diurnal xylem diameter change at different heights in a 37-year-old Scots 
      pine at Hyytiala, southern Finland (61 degrees 51' N, 24 degrees 17' E, 181 m 
      a.s.l.). Shoot transpiration and soil water potential were input data for the 
      model. The biomechanical and hydraulic properties of wood and fine root hydraulic 
      conductance were estimated from simulated and measured stem diameter changes 
      during the course of 1 day. The estimated parameters attained values similar to 
      literature values. The ratios of estimated parameters to literature values ranged 
      from 0.5 to 0.9. The model predictions (stem diameters at several heights) were 
      in close agreement with the measurements for a period of 6 days. The time lag 
      between changes in transpiration rate and in sap flow rate at the base of the 
      tree was about half an hour. The analysis showed that 40% of the resistance 
      between the soil and the top of the tree was located in the rhizosphere. Modeling 
      the water tension gradient and consequent woody diameter changes offer a 
      convenient means of studying the link between wood hydraulic conductivity and 
      control of transpiration.

LID - 10.1007/s005720100117 [doi]
AB  - The arbuscular mycorrhizal status of 112 plant species and the spore density of 
      arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) in the rhizosphere soil of these plants in the 
      tropical rain forest of Xishuangbanna, southwest China, were surveyed. It was 
      found that 56% of the surveyed species were arbuscular mycorrhizal, 31% were 
      possibly arbuscular mycorrhizal and 13% were non-mycorrhizal. The spore density 
      of AMF ranged from 55 to 1,908 per 100 g soil, with an average of 476. The 
      rhizosphere soil from the arbuscular mycorrhizal plants did not always have a 
      higher AMF spore density than that from the possibly mycorrhizal and 
      non-mycorrhizal plants. The clumped distribution of AMF spores and the complex 
      structure of the underground component of the tropical rain forest may be two 
      important factors that affected the spore density of AMF. Fungi belonging to the 
      genera Acaulospora and Glomus are the dominant AMF in the soil of the tropical 
      rain forest of Xishuangbanna.

TI  - Microcosm-based analyses of Scots pine seedling growth, ectomycorrhizal fungal 
      community structure and bacterial carbon utilization profiles in boreal forest 
      humus and underlying illuvial mineral horizons.
PG  - 73-84
AB  - We report on the identity of indigenous mycorrhiza forming fungi and 
      rhizosphere/mycorrhizosphere bacterial community carbon source utilization 
      profiles of Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) seedlings grown in boreal forest 
      humus (O) or illuvial (B) mineral horizon containing microcosm growth systems. 
      Based on rDNA (ITS)-RFLP analyses, a total of 10 fungal RFLP taxa were identified 
      from pre-morphotyped mycorrhizas on 7-month-old seedling roots. Hierarchical 
      cluster analysis, including corresponding RFLPs of known fungal species, 
      confirmed root colonization by eight mycorrhizal species. In the O horizon, roots 
      were colonized by e.g. Suillus bovinus, Suillus variegatus, Cenococcum geophilum, 
      Piloderma croceum, Thelephora terrestris and Russula vinicolor. Mycobiont 
      diversity in the mineral B horizon was lower but included Piceirhiza bicolorata 
      and both Suillus species which produced extensive extramatrical mycelium. In 
      comparison to non-colonized soils, rhizosphere and mycorrhizosphere compartments 
      supported significantly higher numbers of bacteria (mean range 10(8)-10(11) cells 
      g(-1) fresh weight (fw)). Specific rhizosphere/mycorrhizosphere 'niche'-linked 
      bacterial communities were detected following multivariate analyses (PCA and CA) 
      of bacterial carbon utilization profiles (Biolog(R) GN microplate). Distinct 
      preferences for amino and carboxylic acids were identified in mineral B horizon 
      rhizospheres whereas a wider range of carbon sources were utilized in the 
      fungal-dominated mycorrhizospheres irrespective of soil types.

TI  - FUNCTION AND MECHANISM OF ORGANIC ANION EXUDATION FROM PLANT ROOTS.
PG  - 527-560
AB  - The rhizosphere is the zone of soil immediately surrounding plant roots that is 
      modified by root activity. In this critical zone, plants perceive and respond to 
      their environment. As a consequence of normal growth and development, a large 
      range of organic and inorganic substances are exchanged between the root and 
      soil, which inevitably leads to changes in the biochemical and physical 
      properties of the rhizosphere. Plants also modify their rhizosphere in response 
      to certain environmental signals and stresses. Organic anions are commonly 
      detected in this region, and their exudation from plant roots has now been 
      associated with nutrient deficiencies and inorganic ion stresses. This review 
      summarizes recent developments in the understanding of the function, mechanism, 
      and regulation of organic anion exudation from roots. The benefits that plants 
      derive from the presence of organic anions in the rhizosphere are described and 
      the potential for biotechnology to increase organic anion exudation is 
      highlighted.

TI  - Natural abundance of (13)C in CO(2) respired from forest soils reveals speed of 
      link between tree photosynthesis and root respiration.
PG  - 305-308
LID - 10.1007/s004420100667 [doi]
AB  - Soil respiration from a boreal mixed coniferous forest showed large seasonal 
      variation in natural abundance of (13)C, ranging from -21.6 per thousand to -26.5 per thousand. We tested 
      if weather conditions could explain this variation in delta(13)C of respired CO(2), 
      and found that the air relative humidity 1-4 days before the days of CO(2) 
      sampling best explained the variation. This suggested that high delta(13)C values 
      were caused by effects of air humidity on isotope fractionation during 
      photosynthesis and that it took 1-4 days for the C from canopy photosynthesis of 
      20-25 m trees to become available for root/rhizosphere respiration. We calculated 
      that these new photoassimilates could account for at least 65% of total soil 
      respiration.

TI  - Seasonal dynamics of soil carbon dioxide efflux and simulated rhizosphere 
      respiration in a beech forest.
PG  - 145-52
AB  - Respiration of the rhizosphere in a beech (Fagus sylvatica L.) forest was 
      calculated by subtracting microbial respiration associated with organic matter 
      decomposition from daily mean soil CO2 efflux. We used a semi-mechanistic soil 
      organic matter model to simulate microbial respiration, which was validated 
      against "no roots" data from trenched subplots. Rhizosphere respiration exhibited 
      pronounced seasonal variation from 0.2 g C m(-2) day(-1) in January to 2.3 g C 
      m(-2) day(-1) in July. Rhizosphere respiration accounted for 30 to 60% of total 
      soil CO2 efflux, with an annual mean of 52%. The high Q10 (3.9) for in situ 
      rhizosphere respiration was ascribed to the confounding effects of temperature 
      and changes in root biomass and root and shoot activities. When data were 
      normalized to the same soil temperature based on a physiologically relevant Q10 
      value of 2.2, the lowest values of temperature-normalized rhizosphere respiration 
      were observed from January to March, whereas the highest value was observed in 
      early July when fine root growth is thought to be maximal.

TI  - Effects of Pinus sylvestris root growth and mycorrhizosphere development on 
      bacterial carbon source utilization and hydrocarbon oxidation in forest and 
      petroleum-contaminated soils.
PG  - 451-64
AB  - The hypothesis that Pinus sylvestris L. root and mycorrhizosphere development 
      positively influences bacterial community-linked carbon source utilization, and 
      drives a concomitant reduction in mineral oil levels in a petroleum hydrocarbon- 
      (PHC-) contaminated soil was confirmed in a forest ecosystem-based 
      phytoremediation simulation. Seedlings were grown for 9 months in large petri 
      dish microcosms containing either forest humus or humus amended with cores of 
      PHC-contaminated soil. Except for increased root biomass in the humus/PHC 
      treatment, there were no other significant treatment-related differences in plant 
      growth and needle C and N status. Total cell and culturable bacterial (CFU) 
      densities significantly increased in both rhizospheres and mycorrhizospheres that 
      actively developed in the humus and PHC-contaminated soil. Mycorrhizospheres 
      (mycorrhizas and extramatrical mycelium) supported the highest numbers of 
      bacteria. Multivariate analyses of bacterial community carbon source utilization 
      profiles (Biolog GN microplate) from different rhizosphere, mycorrhizosphere, and 
      bulk soil compartments, involving principal component and correspondence 
      analysis, highlighted three main niche-related groupings. The respective clusters 
      identified contained bacterial communities from (i) unplanted bulk soils, (ii) 
      planted bulk PHC and rhizospheres in PHC-contaminated soils, and (iii) planted 
      bulk humus and rhizosphere/mycorrhizosphere-influenced humus, and 
      mycorrhizosphere-influenced PHC contaminated soil. Correspondence analysis 
      allowed further identification of amino acid preferences and increased 
      carboxylic/organic acid preferences in rhizosphere and mycorrhizosphere 
      compartments. Decreased levels of mineral oil (non-polar hydrocarbons) were 
      detected in the PHC-contaminated soil colonized by pine roots and mycorrhizal 
      fungi. These data further support our view that mycorrhizosphere development and 
      function plays a central role in controlling associated bacterial communities and 
      their degradative activities in lignin-rich forest humus and PHC-contaminated 
      soils.

TI  - Humus bacteria of Norway spruce stands: plant growth promoting properties and 
      birch, red fescue and alder colonizing capacity.
PG  - 143-152
AB  - We studied the potential of the humus layer of the Norway spruce stands to supply 
      beneficial rhizobacteria to birch (Betula pendula), alder (Alnus incana) and 
      fescue grass (Festuca rubra), representatives of pioneer vegetation after 
      clear-cutting of the coniferous forest. Axenically grown seedlings of these 
      species were inoculated with the acid spruce humus, pH 3.7-5.3. Actinorhizal 
      propagules, capable of nodulating alder, were present in high density (10(3) 
      g(-1)) in humus of long-term limed plots, whereas plots with nitrogen 
      fertilization contained almost none (</=10 g(-1)). The genera most frequently 
      found in the humus were Bacillus, Paenibacillus, Arthrobacter, Nocardia, 
      Rhodococcus and Pseudomonas, independently of prior liming or fertilization of 
      the plots. The taxa found in the seedling roots differed from that in humus by 
      the prevalence of the Gram-negative genera Pseudomonas, Alcaligenes and 
      Comamonas. Enrichment cultures of the roots on nitrogen-free media yielded 
      Paenibacillus and Rhodococcus species. Nitrogen-fixing R. erythropolis and a 
      novel Paenibacillus, closest by full sequence of 16S rDNA to P. durus, 
      represented new classes of nitrogen-fixing rhizosphere bacteria. In addition, 
      nitrogen-fixing R. fascians was found in the humus. The rhizoflora and humus 
      contained high proportions of bacteria antagonistic towards plant pathogenic 
      Rhizoctonia sp., Botrytis cinerea and Fusarium culmorum. The antagonistic 
      isolates also commonly produced siderophores and/or cell wall degrading enzymes.

TI  - Microbial activities related to C and N cycling and microbial community structure 
      in the rhizospheres of Pinus sylvestris, Picea abies and Betula pendula seedlings 
      in an organic and mineral soil.
PG  - 187-199
AB  - The aim of this study was to determine whether Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.), 
      Norway spruce (Picea abies (L.) Karst.) and silver birch (Betula pendula Roth) 
      seedlings have a selective influence on the soil microbial community structure 
      and activity and whether this varies in different soils. Seedlings of pine, 
      spruce and birch were planted into pots of two soil types: an organic soil and a 
      mineral soil. Pots without seedlings were also included. After one growing 
      season, microbial biomass C (C(mic)) and N (N(mic)), C mineralization, net 
      ammonification, net nitrification, denitrification potential, phospholipid fatty 
      acid (PLFA) patterns and community level physiological profiles (CLPPs) were 
      measured in the rhizosphere soil of the seedlings. In the organic soil, C(mic) 
      and N(mic) were higher in the birch rhizosphere than in pine and spruce 
      rhizosphere. The C mineralization rate was not affected by tree species. 
      Unplanted soil contained the highest amount of mineral N and birch rhizosphere 
      the lowest, but rates of net N mineralization and net nitrification did not 
      differ between treatments. The microbial community structure, measured by PLFAs, 
      had changed in the rhizospheres of all tree species compared to the unplanted 
      soil. Birch rhizosphere was most clearly separated from the others. There was 
      more of the fungal specific fatty acid 18:2omega6,9 and more branched fatty 
      acids, common in Gram-positive bacteria, in this soil. CLPPs, done with Biolog GN 
      plates and 30 additional substrates, separated only birch rhizosphere from the 
      others. In the mineral soil, roots of all tree species stimulated C 
      mineralization in soil and prevented nitrification, but did not affect C(mic) and 
      N(mic), PLFA patterns or CLPPs. The effects of different tree species did not 
      vary in the mineral soil. Thus, in the mineral soil, the strongest effect on soil 
      microbes was the presence of a plant, regardless of the tree species, but in the 
      organic soil, different tree species varied in their influence on soil microbes.

TI  - First Report of Root Rot Caused by Phytophthora cinnamomi on Avocado in Italy.
PG  - 1281
LID - 10.1094/PDIS.1998.82.11.1281C [doi]
AB  - Root rot caused by Phytophthora cinnamomi Rands is generally recognized to be the 
      most important disease of avocado (Persea americana Miller) wherever this 
      tropical fruit tree is grown (3). The disease was first found in Italy in the 
      spring of 1998. Eight-year-old trees, with symptoms ranging from initial to 
      severe, were observed in an experimental field near Rocca di Caprileone, in 
      Sicily. Few trees showed symptoms of both root rot and collar rot. Infected trees 
      were of 13 commercial cultivars. Trees were grafted on two different rootstocks: 
      Hass seedlings and G6 seedlings. G6 is a selection reported to have some field 
      resistance to P. cinnamomi infections (2). However, no correlation was observed 
      between symptom severity and rootstock. P. cinnamomi was isolated on BNPRAH 
      selective medium (4) from trunk bark, feeder roots, and rhizosphere soil of 
      diseased trees, and from roots of symptomless trees. The isolates, identified 
      primarily on the basis of morphological and cultural characteristics, formed 
      rosaceous colonies on potato dextrose agar (PDA) and on corn meal agar (CMA) 
      coralloid-type mycelium, with abundant hyphal swellings, which were typically 
      spherical and in clusters. Chlamydospores were either terminal or intercalary, 
      and often occurred in characteristic grapelike clusters. Sporangia, which were 
      produced in saline solution (1), were broadly ellipsoidal or ovoid, persistent, 
      non-papillate and proliferous. The identification was confirmed by the 
      electrophoresis of mycelial proteins on polyacrylamide slab gel. The 
      electrophoretic patterns of total soluble proteins and eight isozymes (AKP 
      [alkaline phosphatase], EST [esterase], FUM [fumarase], GLC [NAD-glucose 
      dehydrogenase], G6PD [glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase], LDH [lactate 
      dehydrogenase], MDH [malate dehydrogenase], and SOD [superoxide dismutase]) of 
      the isolates from avocado were identical to those of two strains of P. cinnamomi, 
      used as reference (isolate 70473 from International Mycological Institute, U.K., 
      and an isolate from myrtle from the Institute of Plant Pathology, University of 
      Catania, Italy). Conversely, the electrophoretic phenotype of the P. cinnamomi 
      isolates from avocado was clearly distinct from those of reference strains of 
      eight other species included in Waterhouse's taxonomic group VI. Pairings with 
      isolates of a known mating type of P. cinnamomi, P. cryptogea, and P. drechsleri 
      revealed that all the isolates from avocado were A2 mating type. It is possible 
      that P. cinnamomi had been introduced into the experimental field on infected 
      symptomless nursery trees. In Italy, root rot caused by P. cinnamomi could have a 
      significant impact on commercial avocado plantings extending over about 20 ha.

AB  - Exotic grass invasion promotes fire which drives the conversion of native 
      woodlands to exotic grasslands in the seasonally dry submontane forests of the 
      island of Hawai'i. We compared potential rates of N fixation in an unburned 
      forest site and a converted grassland site using the acetylene reduction assay. 
      In addition to measuring rates of N fixation on separate and mixed substrates in 
      each site, we tested the effect of abiotic factors on rates of N fixation of 
      specific substrates. We hypothesized that rates of N fixation would be higher in 
      the converted grassland site. N fixation estimates were 4.9 kg N ha(-1) year(-1) 
      for the unburned forest, and 0.10 kg N ha(-1) year(-1) for the grassland site, so 
      our hypothesis was rejected. The N fixation in the unburned forest occurs mostly 
      on the leaf litter of native woody species. These substrates are absent from the 
      grassland site, except for wood debris which was not consumed during the fires. 
      No nitrogenase activity was detected in the rhizosphere and litter of grasses, 
      the rhizospheres of shrubs or in soil. Although wood debris is not a significant 
      contributor to the N fixed in the unburned forest, it contributes the majority of 
      N fixed in the grassland. The response of nitrogenase activity to varying 
      conditions of moisture and temperature suggests that microclimatic differences 
      between sites do not control differences in N fixation activity; rather, these 
      differences are due to the abundance of N-fixing substrates. The substantial 
      decrease in N fixation activity after the conversion from woodland to grassland 
      implies that ecosystem-level rates of N accretion are decreased by fire in these 
      sites so much that the N lost during volatilization due to fire is not 
      replenished over the long term by N fixation.

TI  - Functional biodiversity of microbial communities in the rhizospheres of hybrid 
      larch (Larix eurolepis) and Sitka spruce (Picea sitchensis).
PG  - 1031-1038
AB  - The diversity of microorganisms associated with trees and their different 
      functional capabilities is thought to be a consequence of variation in carbon 
      compounds in the rhizosphere. We used the Biolog(R) system (Biolog Inc., Hayward, 
      CA), a redox-based test, to construct sole carbon source utilization profiles 
      (metabolic fingerprints) of microbial communities from the rhizospheres and 
      rhizoplanes of hybrid larch (Larix eurolepis A. Henry) and Sitka spruce (Picea 
      sitchensis Bong. Carr.) taken from a farm woodland site and two second-rotation 
      plantation forest sites. Canonical variate analysis (CVA) of carbon utilization 
      data differentiated among the microbial communities from the three forest sites, 
      with the greatest discrimination between the farm woodland and the two 
      second-rotation forest sites. Carbohydrates and carboxylic acids were the 
      substrates responsible for this discrimination. Carbon profiles of the microbial 
      communities from the rhizospheres of the two tree species also clustered when 
      evaluated by CVA, as a result of differences in utilization of carboxylic acids 
      and amino acids, suggesting that these tree species differ in the exudates they 
      produce. Isolation and enumeration of organisms confirmed that there were 
      qualitative and quantitative differences in the culturable populations of 
      microorganisms at the different sites and between tree species. We conclude that 
      Biolog is a useful technique for evaluating the functional diversity of microbial 
      communities; however, to interpret the results accurately, they must be assessed 
      in conjunction with the actual carbon substrates available in the particular 
      ecosystem under study.

PG  - 1009-1013
AB  - We determined the effects of subsoiling on woody lateral roots and enzyme 
      activities involved in stem carbon metabolism of 90- to 100-year-old Jeffrey pine 
      (Pinus jeffreyi Grev. and Balf.) growing on the eastern side of the California 
      Sierra Nevada Range. Twelve 1.0-ha plots were established on each of two sites. 
      Four site treatments-thinning and subsoiling entire plots, thinning and no 
      subsoiling, thinning and subsoiling skid trails only, and no thinning or 
      subsoiling (undisturbed control)-were replicated three times on each site. Root 
      excavations and assays of stem cambium sucrose metabolizing enzymes were carried 
      out during the summer and fall of 1994 and 1995. Subsoiled plots had more roots < 
      1 cm in diameter exhibiting dieback than undisturbed plots. No relationship was 
      found for stem cambial sucrose synthase (SS) activity among treatments or sites; 
      however, a strong seasonal pattern was observed. Activity of 
      pyrophosphate-dependent phosphofructokinase (PPi-PFK) was seasonal, whereas 
      ATP-dependent phosphofructokinase (ATP-PFK) activity was constant throughout the 
      seasons. Neither of the PFK activities responded to treatment or site. Among 
      plots, ergosterol, a surrogate for estimating live fungal biomass, was present in 
      highest concentrations in soil and rhizosphere samples from subsoiled plots.

AB  - A polymerase chain reaction amplification of 23S rDNA was developed to identify 
      Bacillus spp. recovered from roots, mycorrhizae, and rhizosphere soil of 
      conifers. The polymerase chain reaction incorporated a conserved 23S rDNA forward 
      primer in combination with a reverse primer designed to hybridize exclusively to 
      nucleotide sequences of either B. polymyxa or B. mycoides. The amplification 
      provided a rapid and simple means of identifying DNA from isolates of Bacillus, 
      and could be used directly on whole Bacillus cells or mixed populations. The 
      reaction was used to detect and differentiate these Gram-positive species from 
      agar plates inoculated with samples from various conifer samples. A 
      strain-specific primer was also synthesized and used to identify Bacillus which 
      were established within conifer roots 4 weeks after inoculation.

AB  - The symbiotic establishment of mycorrhizal fungi on plant roots is affected in 
      various ways by the other microorganisms of the rhizosphere, and more especially 
      by bacteria. This review discusses the case of some of these bacteria which 
      consistently promote mycorrhizal development, leading to the concept of 
      'mycorrhization' helper bacteria (MHBs). Examples of MHB evidence are given from 
      the literature, with special reference to the Douglas fir (Pseudotsuga menzeisii 
      Mirb. Franco) Laccaria laccata Scop, ex Fr. ectomycorrhizal combination which has 
      been more extensively studied. The fungal specificity of some MHBs and the 
      various mechanisms underlying their effect are discussed, considering five 
      hypotheses: effects on the receptivity of the root, effects on the root-fungus 
      recognition, effects on the fungal growth, modification of the rhizospheric soil, 
      and effects on the germination of the fungal propagule. MHBs are then considered 
      for their ecological and evolutionary implications, and examples of practical 
      applications in forest nurseries are given: when added to the fungal inoculum, 
      MHBs can improve the success of ectomycorrhizal inoculation of planting stocks 
      with fungi selected for their outstanding growth stimulation after outplanting. 
      The conclusion points out a number of fundamental questions which remain 
      unanswered about mycorrhization helper bacteria and suggests some investigation 
      priorities in this new field of mycorrhiza research. Contents Summary 197 I.

TI  - Nutrient cycling in forests.
PG  - 561-582

AB  - Studies of nutrient cycling in forests span more than 100 yr. In earlier years, 
      most attention was given to the measurement of the pools of nutrients in plants 
      and soil and of the return of nutrients from plant to soil in litterfall. The 
      past 20 yr or so have seen a major concentration on the processes of nutrient 
      cycling, with particular emphasis on those processes by which the supply of 
      nutrients to the growing forest is sustained. In the more highly productive 
      forests, up to 10 tonnes of litter of low nutritional quality is deposited 
      annually on the forest floor. The decomposition of this litter, the 
      mineralization of the nutrients it holds, and the uptake of nutrients by tree 
      roots in the carbon-rich environment which results are the themes of this review. 
      Studies of decomposition of litter in forests have been dominated by the role of 
      nitrogen as a limiting factor, a domination which reflects the preponderance of 
      studies of temperate forests in the Northern Hemisphere. For many forests of the 
      world growing on soils of considerable age, it seems more probable that growth 
      and nutrient cycling are limited by phosphorus (or some other element). There is 
      increasing evidence for a number of forests that phosphorus is immobilized in the 
      first stages of decomposition to a significantly greater extent than is nitrogen. 
      Advances in research will depend, as with studies of soil organic matter, in 
      denning and developing analytical techniques for studying biologically active 
      forms of potentially limiting nutrients, rather than total elemental 
      concentrations. The availability of phosphorus in forests is sustained by 
      phosphorus cycling. More than 50% of the total phosphorus in the surface soils is 
      in organic forms and much of the more labile phosphorus is in the form of 
      diesters. Phosphorus availability is determined by competition between biological 
      and geochemical sinks, and it is clear that the sinks in the rhizosphere (plant 
      roots, microorganisms, soil mineral and organic components) are extensively 
      modified by active processes (e.g. production of exudates, nutrient storage in a 
      variety of organic or polymeric forms and nutrient transport away from sites of 
      uptake). There is abundant evidence that roots of many species exude compounds 
      which have the ability to solubilize sources of phosphorus of otherwise low 
      availability. The significance of root exudates (for example, phosphatases, 
      organic acids) in the functioning of perennial ecosystems has yet to be 
      quantified and there are conflicting reports as to the effects of simple organic 
      acids on phosphorus availability. The distribution of phosphorus sinks and their 
      relative competitiveness and their modification are topics of fundamental 
      importance for future research. In contrast to the mineralization of phosphorus, 
      our knowledge of transformations and availability of nitrogen in forest soils is 
      well-developed. Net nitrogen mineralization rates approximate rates of nitrogen 
      return in litterfall but the contribution of nitrification is variable. 
      Nitrification is not inhibited by the low pH of many forest soils and there is 
      increasing evidence of nitrate immobilization by microorganisms and of increased 
      diversity and better competitiveness for NH(4) (+) of nitrifying microorganisms 
      than has previously been accepted. Variability in rates of nitrification is often 
      interpreted as being due to allelopathy. Hypotheses invoking allelopathy are more 
      or less untestable, and it seems likely that new techniques using (15) N in situ 
      will lead to a more fundamental understanding of nitrogen transformations in 
      forest soils. Recent studies in coniferous forest soils have highlighted the 
      short (< 1 d) turnover time of NH(4) (+) . Finally, it seems that forest soils 
      are resistant to major changes in patterns of nitrogen mineralization (and 
      certainly, because of the large number of sinks, in patterns of phosphorus 
      mineralization) following disturbance by natural events such as wind-throw and 
      fire, and by man-made events such as logging and fertilizing. The long-term 
      disturbance by acid rain is a more complex matter since forest ecosystems are not 
      adequate buffers for nitrate. Contents Summary 561 I. Introduction 562 II.

TI  - Consequences of rhizosphere acidification on delivery and uptake kinetics of soil 
      phosphorus.
PG  - 195-204
AB  - Experiments were undertaken to quantify the mechanisms by which acidity might 
      affect phosphorus movement and uptake by black locust (Robinia pseudoacacia L.). 
      Phosphorus diffusion rates in six forest soils were determined by 
      desorption-isotherm buffer power assays. Changes in diffusion as a function of 
      acidity were measured using pH-adjusted desorption solutions. Depending on soil 
      type and phosphorus source solubility, up to a fivefold increase in phosphorus 
      diffusion rate was observed with an increased acidity of one pH unit. Phosphorus 
      uptake rates of mycorrhizal and non-mycorrhizal black locust at pH 4 and pH 7 
      were determined from (32)P-labeled nutrient-depletion experiments. In mycorrhizal 
      plants, the rate of phosphorus uptake at pH 4.0 was twice that observed at pH 
      7.0. Non-mycorrhizal plant uptake rates were similar at both pH 4.0 and pH 7.0. 
      The contribution of soil nutrient supply mechanisms to plant nutrient content 
      increased with rhizosphere acidification. Uptake kinetics were also affected by 
      rhizosphere acidification, but to a lesser extent.

TI  - Occurrence of cluster roots on Myrica cerifera L. (Myricaceae) in water culture 
      in relation to phosphorus nutrition.
PG  - 311-317
LID - 10.1111/j.1469-8137.1990.tb00457.x [doi]
AB  - When Myrica cerifera was grown in a number of 1/1-strength Hoagland's solutions, 
      each lacking one mineral nutrient, cluster roots formed only in solutions lacking 
      phosphorus (P). In seedlings initially fertilized with various P concentrations, 
      cluster root formation decreased with increasing P supply and was totally 
      suppressed in solutions containing >/= 1 mg P l(-1) . As total root weight did not 
      vary significantly between P treatments, the proportion of the root system 
      expressed as cluster roots or non-cluster roots varied with phosphorus supply. A 
      similar response to increasing levels of foliar-applied P suggests that it may be 
      internal P concentration in the plant that determines the initiation of cluster 
      roots and not external P levels in the soil. Nitrogen, supplied as fixed 
      dinitrogen or nitrate, did not have any effect on development of cluster roots 
      and it appears that the capacity of actinorhizal plants to fix nitrogen by 
      symbiotic association with a soil micro-organism is of no significance to cluster 
      root formation. While abundant root hair development and extensive mycorrhizal 
      mycelium distribution in the rhizosphere may represent more efficient 
      morphological forms of improving plant P uptake, the significance of cluster 
      roots in relation to P nutrition and the mechanisms involved in their development 
      warrant further investigation.

TI  - Carbon dioxide assimilation and growth of red spruce (Picea rubens Sarg.) 
      seedlings in response to ozone, precipitation chemistry, and soil type.
PG  - 163-171
LID - 10.1007/BF00379235 [doi]
AB  - The influence of ozone, mist chemistry, rain chemistry, and soil type on CO(2) 
      assimilation and growth of red spruce (Picea rubens Sarg.) seedlings was 
      investigated over a 4-month period under controlled laboratory and glasshouse 
      conditions. Growth was evaluated through interval estimates of aboveground 
      relative growth rates (RGR) and the partitioning of biomass components at harvest 
      to root, stem, and needle fractions. Precipitation chemistry treatments and O(3) 
      exposure dynamics were based on reported characteristics of air chemistry and/or 
      deposition in high-elevation forests of eastern North America. The two soils were 
      collected from Camels Hump in the Green Mountains of Vermont and Acadia National 
      Park on the Maine coast. Soil from Acadia had higher organic content, higher 
      levels of extractable base cations, and lower levels of extractable aluminum and 
      heavy metals. The only treatment variables that consistently influenced the 
      growth of P. rubens were soil type and rain chemistry. In comparison with 
      seedlings grown in soil from Acadia National Park, those grown in Camels Hump 
      soil had significantly less needle (27%), stem (33%), and root (26%) biomass at 
      harvest and statistically lower aboveground RGR within 2 months after initiation 
      of the treatments. Seedlings grown in Camels Hump soil had significantly higher 
      levels of aluminum (6.5X), copper (1.4X), and nickel (2.7X) in new needle tissue. 
      The only influence of precipitation chemistry on the growth of P. rubens was a 
      pattern of greater root and shoot biomass in seedlings experiencing the more 
      acidic rain treatments. Interactive effects among the main treatment variables 
      (e.g., acidic mist and O(3), acidic rain and soil type) on seedling growth were 
      not notable. Rates of CO(2) assimilation and transpiration on a per gram needle 
      dry weight basis [mol.g(-1).s(-1)] were not influenced by any of the main 
      treatment variables or their interaction. Because neither soil type nor 
      precipitation chemistry influenced the efficiency of CO(2) assimilation per gram 
      dry weight of needle tissue, the physiological mechanism underlying the growth 
      response of P. rubens is attributed to a change in either whole-plant allocation 
      of carbon resources or a direct toxic effect in the rhizosphere on root growth.

TI  - Effects of Atmospheric CO(2) Enrichment on the Growth and Mineral Nutrition of 
      Quercus alba Seedlings in Nutrient-Poor Soil.
PG  - 83-9
AB  - One-year-old dormant white oak (Quercus alba L.) seedlings were planted in a 
      nutrient-deficient forest soil and grown for 40 weeks in growth chambers at 
      ambient (362 microliters per liter) or elevated (690 microliters per liter) 
      levels of CO(2). Although all of the seedlings became severely N deficient, CO(2) 
      enrichment enhanced growth by 85%, with the greatest enhancement in root systems. 
      The growth enhancement did not increase the total water use per plant, so 
      water-use efficiency was significantly greater in elevated CO(2). Total uptake of 
      N, S, and B was not affected by CO(2), therefore, tissue concentrations of these 
      nutrients were significantly lower in elevated CO(2). An increase in nutrient-use 
      efficiency with respect to N was apparent in that a greater proportion of the 
      limited N pool in the CO(2)-enriched plants was in fine roots and leaves. The 
      uptake of other nutrients increased with CO(2) concentration, and P and K uptake 
      increased in proportion to growth. Increased uptake of P by plants in elevated 
      CO(2) may have been a result of greater proliferation of fine roots and 
      associated mycorrhizae and rhizosphere bacteria stimulating P mineralization. The 
      results demonstrate that a growth response to CO(2) enrichment is possible in 
      nutrient-limited systems, and that the mechanisms of response may include either 
      increased nutrient supply or decreased physiological demand.

TI  - Microbial relationships in surface-mine revegetation.
PG  - 28-35
LID - 10.1007/BF01875048 [doi]
AB  - The establishment and interrelationships of microorganisms with soil and plant 
      processes during reclamation are greatly influenced by the composition of the 
      planting medium and vegetation practices. While in some instances the parent 
      material may be used as the vegetation medium, the practice of topsoiling, 
      particularly the direct haul method, may be beneficial in introducing 
      microorganisms and improving the quality of the plant growth medium of spoils 
      that are chemically or physically less desirable than the native soils. The 
      influence of different vegetation types on soil development on surface mines may 
      be a reflection of physioiogical differences that affect microbial development in 
      the rhizosphere. Such differences include levels of carbohydrate translocated to 
      the root system and/or released into the surrounding soil; the plant's 
      effectiveness as a mycorrhizal host; and the rate of degradation of plant 
      residues. It has become apparent that microbial interactions are an important 
      part of plant and soil processes in reclamation. While some of the microorganisms 
      important in plant growth and soil development can be introduced readily by 
      management practices, the majority usually are disseminated by natural means and 
      only gradually become a part of the microbial population. More research is needed 
      on developing new methods or refining current procedures for early introduction 
      of these microorganisms in reclamation practices.

TI  - Effects of a hydroxamate siderophore on iron absorption by sunflower and sorghum.
PG  - 36-9
AB  - When Fe was supplied at 100 micromolar in nutrient solution of pH 7.5, 10 and 1 
      micromolar levels of the siderophore desferrioxamine B (DFOB), a microbial iron 
      transport compound, significantly (alpha = 0.05) enhanced growth and reduced 
      chlorosis of an Fe-inefficient variety of sorghum (Sorghum bicolor L.). Although 
      significantly adverse effects resulted when both Fe and desferrioxamine B (DFOB) 
      were added at 100 micromolar as FeDFOB, the plants were relatively healthy when 
      grown with 100 micromolar DFOB plus 200 micromolar Fe. It was concluded that 
      sorghum absorbed Fe from the pool of nonchelated, solubilized Fe, and utilized 
      DFOB as a shuttle agent, in equilibrium with this pool, to transport Fe from 
      finely suspended solid phase Fe particles to the membrane of absorbing root 
      cells.In contrast to sorghum, absorption of Fe by the Fe-efficient species 
      sunflower (Helianthus annuus L.) was related to the level of FeDFOB and 
      independent of the level of solubilized, nonchelated Fe. The latter was decreased 
      whenever the concentration of DFOB was equal to or greater than the concentration 
      of total Fe. For an Fe concentration of 10 micromolar, significantly larger and 
      greener plants were obtained when DFOB was present at 1, 10, or 100 micromolar 
      than in the absence of DFOB. When grown with 100 micromolar FeDFOB, sunflower 
      plants appeared larger and less chlorotic than those supplied with 100 micromolar 
      Fe and no DFOB. Sunflower apparently was able to utilize FeDFOB more directly 
      than was sorghum. It is suggested that sunflower acquires Fe after binding FeDFOB 
      at membrane sites and/or by producing sufficient reductants in the rhizosphere to 
      reduce biologically significant levels of Fe(III)DFOB to the less stable 
      Fe(II)DFOB.
